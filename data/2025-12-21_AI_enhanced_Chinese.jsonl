A common platform is essential to promote collaboration, facilitate exchange of findings, and ensure secure access to sensitive data. Key technical challenges include creating a scalable architecture, a user-friendly interface, and robust security and access control. The BIG-MAP Archive is a cloud-based, disciplinary, private repository designed to address these challenges. Built on InvenioRDM, it leverages platform functionalities to meet consortium-specific needs, providing a tailored solution compared to general repositories. Access can be restricted to members of specific communities or open to the entire consortium, such as the BATTERY 2030+, a consortium accelerating advanced battery technologies. Uploaded data and metadata are controlled via fine grained permissions, allowing access to individual project members or the full initiative. The formalized upload process ensures data are formatted and ready for publication in open repositories when needed. This paper reviews the repository's key features, showing how the BIG-MAP Archive enables secure, controlled data sharing within large consortia. It ensures data confidentiality while supporting flexible, permissions-based access and can be easily redeployed for other consortia, including MaterialsCommons4.eu and RAISE (Resource for AI Science in Europe).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdBIG - MAP Archive\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u5b66\u79d1\u79c1\u6709\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8054\u76df\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u65b0\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8054\u76df\uff08\u5982\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u4ea4\u6362\u6210\u679c\u53ca\u786e\u4fdd\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eInvenioRDM\u7684BIG - MAP Archive\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u53f0\u529f\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u8054\u76df\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6743\u9650\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u6709\u6b63\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4f20\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "BIG - MAP Archive\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8054\u76df\u5185\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u53ef\u9650\u5236\u6216\u5f00\u653e\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6309\u9700\u51c6\u5907\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "conclusion": "BIG - MAP Archive\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u9650\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u8f7b\u677e\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u8054\u76df\u91cd\u65b0\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \\toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \\toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

The corpus is built from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, linking each table to its surrounding model and publication context. Compared with open data lake tables, model tables are smaller yet exhibit denser inter table relationships, reflecting tightly coupled model and benchmark evolution. The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods. By releasing ModelTables and its creation protocol, we provide the first large scale benchmark of structured data describing AI model. Our use case of table discovery in Model Lakes, provides intuition and evidence for developing more accurate semantic retrieval, structured comparison, and principled organization of structured model knowledge.

Sricharan"], "title": "Improved Lower Bounds for Privacy under Continual Release", "categories": ["cs.DS"], "comment": null, "summary": "We study the problem of continually releasing statistics of an evolving dataset under differential privacy. In the event-level setting, we show the first polynomial lower bounds on the additive error for insertions-only graph problems such as maximum matching, degree histogram and $k$-core. This is an exponential improvement on the polylogarithmic lower bounds of Fichtenberger et al.[ESA 2021] for the former two problems, and are the first continual release lower bounds for the latter. Our results run counter to the intuition that the difference between insertions-only vs fully dynamic updates causes the gap between polylogarithmic and polynomial additive error. We show that for maximum matching and $k$-core, allowing small multiplicative approximations is what brings the additive error down to polylogarithmic.\n  Beyond graph problems, our techniques also show that polynomial additive error is unavoidable for Simultaneous Norm Estimation in the insertions-only setting. When multiplicative approximations are allowed, we circumvent this lower bound by giving the first continual mechanism with polylogarithmic additive error under $(1+\u03b6)$ multiplicative approximations, for $\u03b6>0$, for estimating all monotone symmetric norms simultaneously.\n  In the item-level setting, we show polynomial lower bounds on the product of the multiplicative and the additive error of continual mechanisms for a large range of graph problems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first lower bounds for any differentially private continual release mechanism with multiplicative error. To obtain this, we prove a new lower bound on the product of multiplicative and additive error for 1-Way-Marginals, from which we reduce to continual graph problems.

We propose a framework for algorithmic monetary policies that navigates this tradeoff in repeated participation games. Agents, characterized by type (capability) and stake, choose to participate or abstain at each round; the policy (probabilistically) selects high-type agents for task execution (maximizing throughput) while distributing rewards to sustain decentralization. We analyze equilibria under two agent behaviors: myopic (short-term utility maximization) and foresighted (multi-round planning). For myopic agents, performance-centric policies risk centralization, but foresight enables stable decentralization with some volatility to the token value. We further discuss virtual stake--a hybrid of type and stake--as an alternative approach.

For the Navier-Stokes equations, the EG formulation combines continuous Lagrange elements with a discontinuous enrichment vector per element in the velocity space and a piecewise constant pressure space, and it can be implemented efficiently within standard finite element frameworks. To enforce pressure robustness, we construct velocity reconstruction operators that map the discrete EG velocity field into exactly divergence-free, H(div)-conforming fields. In particular, we develop reconstructions based on Arbogast-Correa (AC) mixed finite element spaces on quadrilateral meshes and demonstrate that the resulting schemes remain stable and accurate even on highly distorted grids. The nonlinearity of the coupled Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq system is treated with several iterative strategies, including Picard iterations and Anderson-accelerated iterations; our numerical study shows that Anderson acceleration yields robust and efficient convergence for high Rayleigh number flows within the proposed framework. The performance of the method is assessed on a set of benchmark problems and application-driven test cases.

We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review.

Hoffmann", "Lucas Alf", "Dalvan Griebler"], "title": "LOG.io: Unified Rollback Recovery and Data Lineage Capture for Distributed Data Pipelines", "categories": ["cs.DC"], "comment": null, "summary": "This paper introduces LOG.io, a comprehensive solution designed for correct rollback recovery and fine-grain data lineage capture in distributed data pipelines. It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery.

Existing works mainly focus on recommending a set of items, but online e-commerce platforms have recently begun to pay attention to exploring users' potential interests at the category level. Category-level recommendation allows e-commerce platforms to promote users' engagements by expanding their interests to different types of items. In addition, it complements item-level recommendations when the latter becomes extremely challenging for users with little-known information and past interactions. Furthermore, it facilitates item-level recommendations in existing works. The predicted category, which is called intention in those works, aids the exploration of item-level preference. However, such category-level preference prediction has mostly been accomplished through applying item-level models. Some key differences between item-level recommendations and category-level recommendations are ignored in such a simplistic adaptation.

Furthermore, the utilization of overly simplified neuron models that disregard the intricate biological structures inherently impedes the network's capacity to accurately simulate the actual potential transmission process. To address these issues, we propose a dendrite-soma-axon (DSA) neuron employing the soft reset strategy, in conjunction with a potential change-based perception mechanism, culminating in the change-perceptive dendrite-soma-axon (CP-DSA) neuron. Our model contains multiple learnable parameters that expand the representation space of neurons. The change-perceptive (CP) mechanism enables our model to achieve competitive performance in short time steps utilizing the difference information of adjacent time steps.

Cross-browser inconsistencies (XBIs), variations in how a website is interpreted and displayed on different browsers, can be helpful guides to detect such rendering bugs. Although visual and Document Object Model (DOM)-based analysis techniques exist for detecting XBIs, they often struggle with dynamic and interactive elements. In this study, we discuss our industry experience with using vision language models (VLMs) to identify XBIs. We present the XBIDetective tool which automatically captures screenshots of a website in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, and analyzes them with a VLM for XBIs.

Feedback welcome", "summary": "Financial markets exhibit an apparent paradox: while directional price movements remain largely unpredictable--consistent with weak-form efficiency--the magnitude of price changes displays systematic structure. Here we demonstrate that real-time order-flow entropy, computed from a 15-state Markov transition matrix at second resolution, predicts the magnitude of intraday returns without providing directional information. Analysis of 38.5 million SPY trades over 36 trading days reveals that conditioning on entropy below the 5th percentile increases subsequent 5-minute absolute returns by a factor of 2.89 (t = 12.41, p < 0.0001), while directional accuracy remains at 45.0%--statistically indistinguishable from chance (p = 0.12). This decoupling arises from a fundamental symmetry: entropy is invariant under sign permutation, detecting the presence of informed trading without revealing its direction. Walk-forward validation across five non-overlapping test periods confirms out-of-sample predictability, and label-permutation placebo tests yield z = 14.4 against the null.

Formal tests of unconditional (Kupiec) and conditional (Christoffersen) coverage reveal that an LSTM baseline achieves near-nominal calibration. In contrast, a GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations underestimates tail risk. Our proposed discount-factor DLM model produces a slightly liberal VaR estimate, with evidence of clustered violations. Bayesian logistic regression improves recall and AUC-ROC for fraud detection, and a hierarchical Beta state-space model provides transparent and adaptive compliance risk assessment. The pipeline is distinguished by precise uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and GPU-accelerated analysis, delivering up to 50x speedup.

Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?\n  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.\n  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.\n  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8d85\u5b9a\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u968f\u673a\u4e3b\u5143Cholesky\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u7528\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u77e9\u9635\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u968f\u673a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u4e3b\u5143Cholesky\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In our setting, buyers arrive sequentially demanding a set of items, each with a value drawn from a known distribution. We study environments where buyers' valuations exhibit complementarities. In such settings, standard item-pricing mechanisms fail to leverage item multiplicities, while existing static bundle-pricing mechanisms rely on problem-specific arguments that do not generalize.\n  We develop a unified technique for online resource allocation with complementarities for three domains: (i) single-minded combinatorial auctions with maximum bundle size $d$, (ii) general single-minded combinatorial auctions, and (iii) a graph-based routing model in which buyers request to route a unit of flow from a source node $s$ to a target node $t$ in a capacitated graph. Our approach yields static and anonymous bundle-pricing mechanisms whose performance improves exponentially with item capacities. For the $d$-single-minded setting with minimum item capacity $B$, we obtain an $O(d^{1/B})$-competitive mechanism, recovering the known $O(d)$ bound for unit capacities ($B=1$) and achieving exponentially better guarantees as capacities grow. For general single-minded combinatorial auctions and the graph-routing model, we obtain $O(m^{1/(B+1)})$-competitive mechanisms, where $m$ is the number of items.\n  We complement these results with information-theoretic lower bounds. We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than $\u03a9((m/\\ln m)^{1/(B+2)})$ in the general single-minded setting and $\u03a9((d/\\ln d)^{1/(B+1)})$ in the $d$-single-minded setting.

However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6280\u672f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u578b\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u53d1\u7535\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8557%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u578b\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u5b58\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7efc\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u7b49\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u53d1\u7535\u6210\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u8bbe\u7f6e\u591a\u9879\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u8fd0\u884c\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u6210\u672c\u662f\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u53d1\u7535\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8557%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u8ffd\u6c42\u71c3\u6599\u548c\u70ed\u7ba1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5168\u9762\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity.

These \"setup times\" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.\n  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.\n  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5MIST\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5f00\u5173\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u6392\u961f\uff0c\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aMIST\u7684\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86M/M/k/Setup - Deterministic\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u4e58\u6cd5\u5e38\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u9650\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u5f0f\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Earlier works like CodeAct, DynaSaur, Code Mode have tried to tackle the first two issues by using the whole Python language as its action space: The number of tools that the agent can call becomes infinite. Python code blocks can execute complex actions into a single step and print only relevant results which helps in keeping the context lean. However, the probabilistic instability issue still remains, as for the same task in the same environment, the agent can follow different trajectories due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Therefore, we need procedural memory for consistency and reliability.

Unlike in multilevel modeling where the intraclass correlation (ICC) is routinely manipulated, IRT studies typically treat reliability as an incidental outcome, creating a \"reliability omission\" that obscures the signal-to-noise ratio of generated data. To address this gap, we introduce a principled framework for reliability-targeted simulation, transforming reliability from an implicit by-product into a precise input parameter. We formalize the inverse design problem, solving for a global discrimination scaling factor that uniquely achieves a pre-specified target reliability. Two complementary algorithms are proposed: Empirical Quadrature Calibration (EQC) for rapid, deterministic precision, and Stochastic Approximation Calibration (SAC) for rigorous stochastic estimation. A comprehensive validation study across 960 conditions demonstrates that EQC achieves essentially exact calibration, while SAC remains unbiased across non-normal latent distributions and empirical item pools. Furthermore, we clarify the theoretical distinction between average-information and error-variance-based reliability metrics, showing they require different calibration scales due to Jensen's inequality.

While sampling from explicit lists is well-understood, modern applications -- such as machine learning over relational data -- often require sampling from a set defined implicitly by a relational join. In this paper, we study the problem of \\emph{subset sampling over joins}: drawing a random subset from the join results, where each join result is included independently with some probability. We address the general setting where the probability is derived from input tuple weights via decomposable functions (e.g., product, sum, min, max). Since the join size can be exponentially larger than the input, the naive approach of materializing all join results to perform subset sampling is computationally infeasible. We propose the first efficient algorithms for subset sampling over acyclic joins: (1) a \\emph{static index} for generating multiple (independent) subset samples over joins; (2) a \\emph{one-shot} algorithm for generating a single subset sample over joins; (3) a \\emph{dynamic index} that can support tuple insertions, while maintaining a one-shot sample or generating multiple (independent) samples.

Based on this thesis we published arXiv:2512.14409", "summary": "Democracy relies on making collective decisions through voting. In addition, voting procedures have further applications, for example in the training of artificial intelligence. An essential criterion for determining the winner of a fair election is that all alternatives are treated equally: this is called neutrality. The established Ranked Pairs voting method cannot simultaneously guarantee neutrality and be computationally tractable for election with ties. River, the recently introduced voting method, shares desirable properties with Ranked Pairs and has further advantages, such as a new property related to resistance against manipulation. Both Ranked Pairs and River use a weighted margin graph to model the election. Ties in the election can lead to edges of equal margin. To order the edges in such a case, a tiebreaking scheme must be employed. Many tiebreaks violate neutrality or other important properties. A tiebreaking scheme that preserves neutrality is Parallel Universe Tiebreaking (PUT). Ranked Pairs with PUT is NP-hard to compute.\n  The main result of this thesis shows that River with PUT can be computed in polynomial worst-case runtime: We can check whether an alternative is a River PUT winner, by running River with a specially constructed ordering of the edges. To construct this ordering, we introduce the semi-River diagram which contains the edges that can appear in any River diagram for some arbitrary tiebreak. On this diagram we can compute the River winners, by applying a variant of Prims algorithm per alternative. Additionally, we give an algorithm improve the previous naive runtime of River from $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\log n)$, where n is the number of alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations.

Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles.

While behavioral fingerprinting based on network traffic analysis has shown promise, most existing approaches rely on machine learning (ML) techniques applied to fine-grained features of short-lived traffic units (packets and/or flows). These methods tend to be computationally expensive, sensitive to traffic measurement errors, and often produce opaque inferences. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic, lightweight, and explainable alternative to behavioral fingerprinting focusing on the network services (e.g., TCP/80, UDP/53) that IoT devices use to perform their intended functions over extended periods. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We demonstrate that IoT devices exhibit stable and distinguishable patterns in their use of network services over a period of time. We formalize the notion of service-level fingerprints and derive a generalized method to represent network behaviors using a configurable granularity parameter. (2) We develop a procedure to extract service-level fingerprints, apply it to traffic from 13 consumer IoT device types in a lab testbed, and evaluate the resulting representations in terms of their convergence and recurrence properties. (3) We validate the efficacy of service-level fingerprints for device identification in closed-set and open-set scenarios.

In this work, we analyze the representational power of SNNs by viewing them as sequence-to-sequence processors of spikes, i.e., systems that transform a stream of input spikes into a stream of output spikes. We establish the universal representation property for a natural class of spike train functions. Our results are fully quantitative, constructive, and near-optimal in the number of required weights and neurons. The analysis reveals that SNNs are particularly well-suited to represent functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions of such functions. The latter is of particular interest, as it indicates that deep SNNs can efficiently capture composite functions via a modular design.

Joel Mokyr has argued that self-sustained modern economic growth originated from a feedback loop between propositional (theoretical) and prescriptive (applied) knowledge, which turned positive in the eighteenth century during the \"Industrial Enlightenment\".

This paper provides the first quantitative evidence by estimating the impact of knowledge spillovers between propositional and prescriptive knowledge on innovation in England, 1600-1800. For this, it introduces two new text-based measures for 1) the innovativeness of publications and 2) knowledge spillovers. The paper finds strong evidence that a feedback loop between propositional and prescriptive knowledge became positive during the second half of the eighteenth century.

For the latter, we introduce a new approach to obtain Berry-Esseen inequalities for nonlinear functions of sum statistics under some convexity assumptions.

Traditional approaches for identifying clusters of survival curves often rely on computationally intensive bootstrap techniques to approximate the null hypothesis distribution. While effective, these methods impose significant computational burdens. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the k-means and log-rank test to efficiently identify and cluster survival curves. Our method eliminates the need for computationally expensive resampling, significantly reducing processing time while maintaining statistical reliability. By systematically evaluating survival curves and determining optimal clusters, the proposed method ensures a practical and scalable alternative for large-scale survival data analysis. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves results comparable to existing bootstrap-based clustering methods while dramatically improving computational efficiency.

Model-based estimators of individual treatment effects (ITE) from machine learning require large sample sizes, limiting their applicability in domains such as behavioral sciences with smaller datasets. We demonstrate how estimation of ITEs with Treatment Agnostic Representation Networks (TARNet; Shalit et al., 2017) can be improved by leveraging knowledge from source datasets and adapting it to new settings via transfer learning (TL-TARNet; Aloui et al., 2023). In simulations that vary source and sample sizes and consider both randomized and non-randomized intervention target settings, the transfer-learning extension TL-TARNet improves upon standard TARNet, reducing ITE error and attenuating bias when a large unbiased source is available and target samples are small. In an empirical application using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), we estimate the effect of mothers' firewood collection time on children's weekly study time; transfer learning pulls the target mean ITEs toward the source ITE estimate, reducing bias in the estimates obtained without transfer.

Results show that OpenAlex indexes only 37% of GCJC journals and 24% of their articles, with substantial disciplinary and temporal variation. Metadata quality is uneven: while basic fields such as title and publication year are complete, bibliographic details, author affiliations, and cited references are frequently missing or inaccurate.

However, under uncertainty and incomplete information, as is characteristic in real-time advertising markets, truthful bidding may not always represent a dominant strategy or yield a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Real-Time Bidding (RTB) platforms operationalize impression-level auctions via programmatic interfaces, where advertisers compete in first-price auction settings and often resort to bid shading, i.e., strategically submitting bids below their private valuations to optimize payoff. \nThis paper empirically investigates bid shading behaviors and strategic adaptation using large-scale RTB auction data from the Yahoo Webscope dataset. Integrating Minority Game Theory with clustering algorithms and variance-scaling diagnostics, we analyze equilibrium bidding behavior across temporally segmented impression markets. Our results reveal the emergence of minority-based bidding strategies, wherein agents partition hourly ad slots into submarkets and place bids strategically where they anticipate being in the numerical minority. This strategic heterogeneity facilitates reduced expenditure while enhancing win probability, functioning as an endogenous bid shading mechanism. The analysis highlights the computational and economic implications of minority strategies in shaping bidder dynamics and pricing outcomes in decentralized, high-frequency auction environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u96c5\u864e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\uff08RTB\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u9634\u5f71\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u6570\u8005\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u7b49\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u8005\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u652f\u51fa\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6807\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u62cd\u5356\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e7f\u544a\u5e02\u573a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u9002\u7528\uff0cRTB\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u51fa\u4ef7\u9634\u5f71\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u96c5\u864eWebscope\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u6570\u8005\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5370\u8c61\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5747\u8861\u51fa\u4ef7\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u8005\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5546\u5c06\u5e7f\u544a\u4f4d\u5212\u5206\u5b50\u5e02\u573a\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u51fa\u4ef7\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u652f\u51fa\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6807\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c11\u6570\u8005\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5206\u6563\u9ad8\u9891\u62cd\u5356\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u51fa\u4ef7\u8005\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

How do social comparisons shape green preferences over time? To answer these questions, we develop an environmental Overlapping Generations (OLG) model that explicitly accounts for Veblen effects and allows green preferences to be updated asynchronously, influenced by past environmental conditions and relative status considerations. We show that, along the optimal path, positional spending leads to overconsumption, which is detrimental to the environment. Taxing consumption is counterproductive as it does not directly address the social comparisons issue, leaving the problem unchanged. When the Veblenian mechanism is weak, the introduction of a materialistic ``secular trend'' -- that lowers the importance placed on the public good -- gives rise to two stable equilibria separated by a saddle: one in which agents care about environmental quality as much as consuming, and the other in which they derive utility solely from the latter. Studying the basins of attraction reveals that green investments are highly fragile. Our numerical experiments further indicated that, when Veblen effects are strong, the model depicts endogenous, persistent, aperiodic oscillations. In this case, green preferences fluctuate close to zero, and environmental quality is very low. Taken together, these findings suggest environmental vulnerability grows in parallel with status-driven consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u73af\u5883\u53e0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u4f4d\u9a71\u52a8\u6d88\u8d39\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u73af\u5883\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u662f\u5426\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6d88\u8d39\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u751f\u6001\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5851\u9020\u7eff\u8272\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8003\u8651\u51e1\u52c3\u4f26\u6548\u5e94\u4e14\u5141\u8bb8\u7eff\u8272\u504f\u597d\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53e0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\uff0c\u5730\u4f4d\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6d88\u8d39\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u6d88\u8d39\u7a0e\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u793e\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u51e1\u52c3\u4f26\u673a\u5236\u5f31\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u7eff\u8272\u6295\u8d44\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u51e1\u52c3\u4f26\u6548\u5e94\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5448\u73b0\u5185\u751f\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u7eff\u8272\u504f\u597d\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73af\u5883\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u968f\u5730\u4f4d\u9a71\u52a8\u6d88\u8d39\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002"}}

While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent. In evaluations across 20 popular Java projects, ClassLAR outperformed all state-of-the-art techniques in architectural-level similarity metrics while achieving execution times that were 3.99 to 10.50 times faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7801\u7ea7\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u6062\u590d\u6280\u672f\u6a21\u5757\u5316 Java \u9879\u76ee\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa ClassLAR \u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece Java \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u4ee3\u7801\u7ea7\u62bd\u8c61\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u6062\u590d\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4f53 Java \u9879\u76ee\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5230 JPMS \u6a21\u5757\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ClassLAR \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5305\u548c\u7c7b\u540d\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u9650\u5b9a\u7c7b\u540d\u4ece\u5355\u4f53 Java \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d Java \u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728 20 \u4e2a\u6d41\u884c Java \u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cClassLAR \u5728\u67b6\u6784\u7ea7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb 3.99 \u5230 10.50 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ClassLAR \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4f53 Java \u9879\u76ee\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation.

Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $\u03b1$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\\Pr_{D}[E] \\ge 1-\u03b1$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can approximate any convex set. This problem has been studied in many different communities. In statistics, this is the classic minimum volume estimator introduced by Rousseeuw as a robust non-parametric estimator of location and scatter. However in high dimensions, it becomes NP-hard to obtain any non-trivial approximation factor in volume when the condition number $\u03b2$ of the ellipsoid (ratio of the largest to the smallest axis length) goes to $\\infty$. This motivates the focus of our paper: can we efficiently find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees when compared to ellipsoids of bounded condition number $\u03b2$?\n  Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that finds an ellipsoid $E$ whose volume is within a $O(\u03b2^{\u03b3d})$ multiplicative factor of the volume of best $\u03b2$-conditioned ellipsoid while covering at least $1-O(\u03b1/\u03b3)$ probability mass for any $\u03b3< \u03b1$. We complement this with a computational hardness result that shows that such a dependence seems necessary up to constants in the exponent. The algorithm and analysis uses the rich primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality. As a consequence, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with approximation guarantees on worst-case instances of the robust subspace recovery problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\u7f6e\u4fe1\u692d\u7403\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u4f53\u79ef\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u692d\u7403\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u83b7\u9c81\u68d2\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0b\u83b7\u53d6\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4f53\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u5728\u692d\u7403\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u4e3aNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u5426\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u4e0e\u6709\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u692d\u7403\u76f8\u6bd4\u6709\u4f53\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u692d\u7403\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u4f53\u79ef\u5305\u56f4\u692d\u7403\u7684\u539f\u59cb - \u5bf9\u5076\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55Brascamp - Lieb\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u7684\u692d\u7403\u4f53\u79ef\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u03b2\u6761\u4ef6\u692d\u7403\u4f53\u79ef\u7684$O(\u03b2^{\u03b3d})$\u500d\u5185\uff0c\u4e14\u8986\u76d6\u81f3\u5c11$1 - O(\u03b1/\u03b3)$\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6307\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u5e38\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm.

Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation.

To address the issue, we propose InfoDCL, a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework for recommendation. Rather than injecting randomly sampled Gaussian noise, we employ a single-step diffusion process that integrates noise with auxiliary semantic information to generate signals and feed them to the standard diffusion process to generate authentic user preferences as contrastive views. Besides, based on a comprehensive analysis of the mutual influence between generation and preference learning in InfoDCL, we build a collaborative training objective strategy to transform the interference between them into mutual collaboration. Additionally, we employ multiple GCN layers only during inference stage to incorporate higher-order co-occurrence information while maintaining training efficiency.

Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability.

We introduce the Smart Data Portfolio (SDP) framework, which treats data categories as productive but risk-bearing assets, formalizing input governance as an information-risk trade-off. Within this framework, we define two portfolio-level quantities, Informational Return and Governance-Adjusted Risk, whose interaction characterizes data mixtures and generates a Governance-Efficient Frontier.

Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u6709\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u53d7LLMs\u6210\u529f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6846\u67b6LLM4Perf\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cLLM4Perf\u5728\u8fd168.8%\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u526a\u679d\u8fd8\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u7ec4\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aLLMs\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6210\u529f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria.

However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.\n  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684MOBIMEM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOBIMEM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u539f\u8bed\u89e3\u8026\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u53d7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u7f16\u6392\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728AndroidWorld\u548c\u524d50\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cMOBIMEM\u5b9e\u73b083.1%\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u95f423.83ms\uff08\u6bd4GraphRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb280\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad850.3%\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MOBIMEM\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases.

Batley", "Sourav Saha"], "title": "A Unified Generative-Predictive Framework for Deterministic Inverse Design", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci"], "comment": null, "summary": "Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \\emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \\emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity.

However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution.

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdStackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF)\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u548c\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "SLHF\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u975e\u4f20\u9012\u504f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "SLHF\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components.

To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.\n  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u6563\u5185\u5b58\uff08DM\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728MN\u7684RDMA\u7f51\u5361\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLotus\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DM\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dMN\u7684RDMA\u7f51\u5361\u56e0\u5927\u91cf\u5355\u8fb9\u539f\u5b50\u9501\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLotus\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u9501\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5728CN\u6267\u884c\u9501\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u9501\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9501\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u52a1\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u514d\u9501\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524dDM\u4e0a\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u4e8b\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cLotus\u5c06\u4e8b\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f32.1\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e49.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Lotus\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u9501\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MN RNIC\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.\n  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \\emph{explicit}, and \\emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $\u03bc$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}\\!\\left(\\frac{dL}\u03bc\\log\\!\\frac{dL}{\u03bc\u03b4}\\log\\!\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ to find an $\\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\\mathcal O\\!\\left(\\frac{dL}{\\varepsilon}\\log\\!\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. Notation $\\cO(\\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}(\\cdot)$ hides extra $\\log\\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-\u03b4$ with $0<\u03b4<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques.

While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.\n  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.\n  Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth. When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines.

Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models.

As an application, we show how to use these circuits to design quantum adders with $1.893\\log(n) + O(1)$ Toffoli depth, $O(n)$ Toffoli gates, and $O(n)$ additional qubits, improving the Toffoli depth and/or Toffoli size of existing constructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u524d\u7f00\u548c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9012\u5f52\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u8be5\u7535\u8def\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u671f\u671b\u627e\u5230\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u52a9\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u51681\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u514b\u7f57\u5185\u514b\u79ef\u4e4b\u548c\u7684\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9012\u5f52\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7535\u8def\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u96f6\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u6bcf\u7ea7\u6052\u5b9a\u6247\u51fa\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e25\u683c\u5c0f\u4e8e2log(n)\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u5728Toffoli\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001Toffoli\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u989d\u5916\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u7535\u8def\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries.

Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead.

Revisiting Automated Compiler Fault Isolation", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": "Accepted at ICSE'26", "summary": "Background: Compilers are fundamental to software development, translating high-level source code into executable software systems. Faults in compilers can have severe consequences and thus effective localization and resolution of compiler bugs are crucial. Problem: In practice, developers often examine version history to identify and investigate bug-inducing commit (BIC) for fixing bugs. However, while numerous sophisticated Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques have been proposed for compiler fault isolation, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against the BIC-based strategies widely adopted in practice. Objective: This study aims to bridge this gap by directly comparing a BIC-based strategy, Basic, with representative SBFL techniques in the context of compiler fault localization. The BIC-based strategy closely aligns with common developer practices, as it directly identifies the BIC and treats the files modified in that commit as faulty candidates. Method: The Basic identifies the most recent good release and earliest bad release, and then employs a binary search to pinpoint the bug-inducing commit. All files modified in the identified commit are flagged as potentially faulty. We rigorously compare Basic against SBFL-based techniques using a benchmark consisting of 60 GCC bugs and 60 LLVM bugs. Result: Our analysis reveals that Basic performs comparably to, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art SBFL-based techniques, particularly on the critical Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the practical effectiveness of SBFL-based techniques in real-world compiler debugging scenarios.

Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FSL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VSR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8b\u540e\u6821\u6b63\uff08POC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347 FSL \u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "VSR \u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5c11\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76 LMMs \u5728 VSR \u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u80fd\u5426\u8d85\u8d8a FSL \u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa POC \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5305\u542b\u8f6f\u6700\u5927\u503c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f LMM \u5bf9 FSL \u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a VSR \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPOC \u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684 FSL \u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8 6.4%\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "POC \u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709 FSL \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios.

Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database (\"knowledge base\" or \"knowledge graph\"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface.

Its application to deep learning (DL) has expanded beyond classical testing to support tasks such as fault localization, repair, data generation, and model robustness evaluation. The core assumption is that mutants behave similarly to real faults, an assumption well established in traditional software systems but largely unverified for DL.\n  This study presents the first empirical comparison of pre-training and post-training mutation approaches in DL with respect to realism. We introduce a statistical framework to quantify their coupling strength and behavioral similarity to real faults using publicly available bugs datasets: CleanML, DeepFD, DeepLocalize, and defect4ML. Mutants are generated using state-of-the-art tools representing both approaches.\n  Results show that pre-training mutants exhibit consistently stronger coupling and higher behavioral similarity to real faults than post-training mutants, indicating greater realism.

The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation.

However, different dimension reduction methods often output different and possibly conflicting visualizations of the same data. This problem is further exacerbated by the choice of hyperparameters, which may substantially impact the resulting visualization. To obtain a more robust and trustworthy dimension reduction output, we advocate for a consensus approach, which summarizes multiple visualizations into a single consensus dimension reduction visualization. Here, we leverage ideas from multi-view learning in order to identify the patterns that are most stable or shared across the many different dimension reduction visualizations, or views, and subsequently visualize this shared structure in a single low-dimensional plot. We demonstrate that this consensus visualization effectively identifies and preserves the shared low-dimensional data structure through both simulated and real-world case studies.

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches.

Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood. We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%. Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations. We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity.

To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGLOW\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eAgentic Workflows\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GNN\u4e0eLLM\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Agentic Workflows\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5176\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u6267\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGLOW\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GNN\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548cLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7528\u9762\u5411\u56fe\u7684LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4e0eGNN\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u7ec6\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4", "result": "\u5728FLORA - Bench\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGLOW\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6392\u540d\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "GLOW\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684Agentic Workflows\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%).

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faM - ESU\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u5347\u7ea7\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faMILP\u548cM - ESU/H\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793aM - ESU/H\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MEC\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u5e74\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5347\u7ea7\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM - ESU\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u591a\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u7ed9\u51faMILP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5M - ESU/H\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dM - ESU/H\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u8ddd\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u57281.25%\u5185\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff1b\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dM - ESU/H\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6848\u4efb\u52a1\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe21.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "M - ESU/H\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u957f\u671fMEC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Prior work has proposed metamorphic testing to detect fairness issues, applying input transformations to uncover inconsistencies in model behavior. This paper introduces an alternative perspective for testing counterfactual fairness in LLMs, proposing a structured and intent-aware framework coined CAFFE (Counterfactual Assessment Framework for Fairness Evaluation). Inspired by traditional non-functional testing, CAFFE (1) formalizes LLM-Fairness test cases through explicitly defined components, including prompt intent, conversational context, input variants, expected fairness thresholds, and test environment configuration, (2) assists testers by automatically generating targeted test data, and (3) evaluates model responses using semantic similarity metrics. Our experiments, conducted on three different architectural families of LLM, demonstrate that CAFFE achieves broader bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior than existing metamorphic approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCAFFE\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7528\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAFFE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cCAFFE\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "CAFFE\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTAO - Net\u5bf9\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u6d41\u91cf\u7c7b\u578b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94OOD\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edcTAO - Net\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u6df7\u5408OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u533a\u5206ID\u548cOOD\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5c06OOD\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aTAO - Net\u8fbe\u523096.81 - 97.70%\u7684\u5b8f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c96.77 - 97.68%\u7684\u5b8fF1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u8fbe44.73 - 86.30%\u5b8f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TAO - Net\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u5174\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.

Initially, the design and user interaction related information is collected as well as pre-processed for min-max normalization. Next, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based features are extracted, followed by user behaviour pattern grouping. Meanwhile, the CR assessment is done using FECSM.

We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy.

Despite decades of research, applying the optimal composition of loop transformations remains challenging due to inherent complexities, including cost modeling for optimization objectives. Recent studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization. However, our key observation is that LLMs often struggle with effective loop transformation optimization, frequently leading to errors or suboptimal optimization, thereby missing opportunities for performance improvements. To bridge this gap, we propose LOOPRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to guide LLMs in performing effective loop optimization on Static Control Part. We introduce a parameter-driven method to harness loop properties, which trigger various loop transformations, and generate diverse yet legal example codes serving as a demonstration source. To effectively obtain the most informative demonstrations, we propose a loop-aware algorithm based on loop features, which balances similarity and diversity for code retrieval. To enhance correct and efficient code generation, we introduce a feedback-based iterative mechanism that incorporates compilation, testing and performance results as feedback to guide LLMs. Each optimized code undergoes mutation, coverage and differential testing for equivalence checking. We evaluate LOOPRAG on PolyBench, TSVC and LORE benchmark suites, and compare it against compilers (GCC-Graphite, Clang-Polly, Perspective and ICX) and representative LLMs (DeepSeek and GPT-4). The results demonstrate average speedups over base compilers of up to 11.20$\\times$, 14.34$\\times$, and 9.29$\\times$ for PolyBench, TSVC, and LORE, respectively, and speedups over base LLMs of up to 11.97$\\times$, 5.61$\\times$, and 11.59$\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLOOPRAG\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u6b21\u4f18\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9519\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLOOPRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728PolyBench\u3001TSVC\u548cLORE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "LOOPRAG\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These challenges are amplified in safety- and mission-critical systems, which must undergo rigorous scrutiny during design and development. Key among these challenges is the difficulty of specifying requirements that use probabilistic constructs to capture the uncertainty affecting these systems. To enable formal analysis, such requirements must be expressed in precise mathematical notations such as probabilistic logics. However, expecting developers to write requirements directly in complex formalisms is unrealistic and highly error-prone. We extend the structured natural language used by NASA's Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET) with support for the specification of unambiguous and correct probabilistic requirements, and develop an automated approach for translating these requirements into logical formulas. We propose and develop a formal, compositional, and automated approach for translating structured natural-language requirements into formulas in probabilistic temporal logic. To increase trust in our formalizations, we provide assurance that the generated formulas are well-formed and conform to the intended semantics through an automated validation framework and a formal proof.

Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies.

Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReactorFold\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u71c3\u6599\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u4eba\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u5806\u82af\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u71c3\u6599\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6570\u636e\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574\u9486\u5e93\u5b58\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5185\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u7269\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views.

They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery.

The VIRGO network (Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for scalable grid computing) provides a scalable overlay for organizing distributed systems but lacks intrinsic security and privacy mechanisms. This paper proposes Private Virtual Tree Networks (PVTNs), a cryptographically enforced extension that leverages the VIRGO overlay to mirror real organizational hierarchies. In PVTNs, join requests are encrypted with the manager's public key to ensure confidentiality, while membership authorization is enforced through manager-signed delegation certificates. Public keys are treated as organizational secrets and are disclosed only within direct manager-member relationships, resulting in a private, non-enumerable virtual tree.

Machine learning models are built into the system, such as the Random Forest Classifier for proactive maintenance and the Isolation Forest for finding outliers. These models help with decision-making and reducing downtime. Streamlit makes real-time data visualisation possible, giving workers access to dashboards that they can interact with and see real-time observations.The system was tested with fake data and is made to be scalable, so it can be used in real time in XRIT's production setting. Adding an AI-powered virtual assistant made with GPT-4 lets workers get real-time, useful information that makes complicated questions easier to answer and improves operational decisions.

We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy.

Software model checking has been successfully applied to check interface specifications in application programs, but its employment in industrial practice is hindered by its unpredictability (whether it succeeds for a given application program or not). In this paper, we present a novel approach to address this problem by checking the HAL interface specification continuously and right from the start of the development. I.e., we develop an embedded application in several iterations without a formal connection between the steps. The steps start from a program skeleton which does nothing but calling HAL functions. Actual functionality is added consecutively. The HAL interface specification is checked in each step of the sequence. The idea of the approach is to exploit a specific feature of software model checking: Its attempt to compute exactly the abstraction that is needed for the check to succeed may carry over from one step to the next, even if there is no formal connection between the steps. The experience from a preliminary experimental evaluation of our approach in the development of embedded applications is very promising. Following our approach, the check succeeds in each step and in particular in the final application program.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4f0a\u59cb\u5c31\u6301\u7eed\u68c0\u67e5\u786c\u4ef6\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\uff08HAL\uff09\u63a5\u53e3\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u867d\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a5\u53e3\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u4f7f\u7528HAL\u63a5\u53e3\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u591a\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u4ec5\u8c03\u7528HAL\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9aa8\u67b6\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b9e\u9645\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u90fd\u68c0\u67e5HAL\u63a5\u53e3\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u68c0\u67e5\u90fd\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u4e5f\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists.

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eQMIX\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u7b56\u5bf9\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eQMIX\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5404\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8054\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u53d1\u5c04\u9891\u7387\u548c\u529f\u7387\uff0cQMIX\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f46\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "QMIX\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u8f85\u52a9\u754c\u9650\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5e72\u6270\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u969c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8840\u6813\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8840\u6813\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u65cb\u8f6c\u8840\u6cf5\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8840\u6813\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u8840\u6813\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u751f\u957f\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7ba1\u9053\u63a8\u5bfc\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u73b0\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8840\u6813\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u79bb\u5fc3\u6cf5\u4e2d\u8840\u6813\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8840\u6813\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u673a\u5236\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eCFD\u7684\u8840\u6813\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion.

While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs.

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u65e0\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f20\u70ed\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u65e0\u77e5\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528GNN\u8868\u793a\u65e0\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7f3a\u5931\u7269\u7406\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "GNN\u6210\u529f\u6355\u83b7\u65e0\u77e5\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u63a8\u5e7f\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u62df\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u73af\u5883\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u52a8\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62dfKubernetes\u96c6\u7fa4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u6821\u51c6\u5185\u90e8\u65f6\u949f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565 (TS-DP) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u5907\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u6709\u635f\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u65e0\u635f\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa TS-DP \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u53bb\u566a\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e RL \u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTS-DP \u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe 4.17 \u500d\uff0c\u8349\u7a3f\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u8d85 94%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u9891\u7387\u8fbe 25 Hz\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "TS-DP \u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \\textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \\textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable.

In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples.

However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD.

Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation.

Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.\n  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684PoQ\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u539fPoQ\u516c\u5f0f\u5ffd\u7565\u8282\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684PoQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6548\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u7eb3\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u548cGPT\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf-\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff1b\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u8d28\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4f4e\u6548\u4f4e\u8d28\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684PoQ\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off.

Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels.

Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm.

Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5546\u7528RFID\u8ffd\u8e2a\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6807\u8bb0\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u8fbeGPS\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u7528RFID\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u7eb9\u6cd5\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6807\u8bb0\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u6cd5\u6807\u8bb0\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65f6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8eRF\u4fe1\u53f7\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u5404\u79cd\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u6cd5\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u5df2\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eGPS\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u591a\u4e2a\u91ce\u706b\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6807\u8bb0\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8eGPS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8d44\u4ea7\u5177\u6709\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management.

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807DFF\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u865a\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u9760\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ca\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDFF\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cDFF\u5f15\u5bfc\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DFF\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u865a\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u62a5\u544a\u6536\u96c6\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u53ef\u80fd\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6216\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6e90\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u5206\u6563\u3002", "method": "\u4eceCOSEAL\u793e\u533a\u5404\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u6536\u96c6\u6db5\u76d6\u6574\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5468\u671f\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": " established\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u9886\u57df\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

SNAC-Pack combines Neural Architecture Codesign's multi-stage search capabilities with the Resource Utilization and Latency Estimator, enabling multi-objective optimization across accuracy, FPGA resource utilization, and latency without requiring time-intensive synthesis for each candidate model. We demonstrate SNAC-Pack on a high energy physics jet classification task, achieving 63.84% accuracy with resource estimation. When synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU13P FPGA, the SNAC-Pack model matches baseline accuracy while maintaining comparable resource utilization to models optimized using traditional BOPs metrics.

However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u538b\u7f29\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u672c\u5730\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u800cCPU\u4e0a\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u5f8b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5728MacBook Pro M2\u548cRaspberry Pi 5\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027CPU\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u523b\u753b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u201c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u62d0\u70b9\u201d\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u538b\u7f29\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u5904\u7406\u662f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6Needle in the Web\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u9875\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u58f0\u660e\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b663\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u6db5\u76d6\u4e03\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e35%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u9886\u57df\u6216\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "Needle in the Web\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u7cca\u68c0\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684DeepOSets\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u591a\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u65b0PDE\u7684\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4e14\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u903c\u8fd1\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7684PDE\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u5426\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u65b0PDE\u7684\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9DeepOSets\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5f53\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u903c\u8fd1\u5668\u3002", "result": "DeepOSets\u80fd\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u65b0PDE\u7684\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u903c\u8fd1\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7684PDE\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684DeepOSets\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7684PDE\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance.

At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks.

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology.

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix.

As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness.

We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDVIA\u653b\u51fb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5df2\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u98ce\u9669\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u9690\u79c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u76ca\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDVIA\uff08\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u53d6\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DVIA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u653e\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD.

Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting.

Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility.

Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents.

Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data.

Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls.

In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training.

To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics.

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency.

Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly.

Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\\pm0.16\\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\\pm0.32\\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\\pm0.09\\%$) datasets. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9), achieving an average power envelope of 36.45mW.

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively.

To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice.

To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation.

When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a5\u53d7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u9650\u5236\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u7c97\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b50\u94fe\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u66f4\u597d\u3001\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u9006\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation.

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication.

Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours.

However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods.

To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDataFlow\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f17\u591a\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6709DataFlow - Agent\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u6d41\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u4e14\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u62bd\u8c61\u7684DataFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bPyTorch\u98ce\u683cAPI\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8fd1200\u4e2a\u7b97\u5b50\u548c6\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DataFlow - Agent\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f7f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DataFlow\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, this new data source paradigm may introduce important security concerns. This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chains, namely Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples.

These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses.

However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications.

However, recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and adjacent digital frontier technologies pose significant challenges to the protection and realization of these rights. This owes to the increasing influence of AI systems on the creation and depiction of cultural content, affect the use and distribution of the intellectual property of individuals and communities, and influence cultural participation and expression worldwide. In addition, the growing influence of AI thus risks exacerbating preexisting economic, social and digital divides and reinforcing inequities for marginalized communities. This dynamic challenges the existing interplay between cultural rights and the right to development, and raises questions about the integration of cultural and developmental considerations into emerging AI governance frameworks. To address these challenges, the paper examines the impact of AI on both categories of rights. Conceptually, it analyzes the epistemic and normative limitations of AI with respect to cultural and developmental assumptions embedded in algorithmic design and deployment, but also individual and structural impacts of AI on both rights. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and tensions in existing AI governance frameworks with respect to cultural rights and the right to development.\n  By situating cultural rights and the right to development within the broader landscape of AI and human rights, this paper contributes to the academic discourse on AI ethics, legal frameworks, and international human rights law.

Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators.

AI tools embedded in digital devices support decision-making and operational management at both individual and organizational levels, including resource allocation, workflow automation, and real-time data analysis. However, the prevailing cloud-centric deployment of AI carries a substantial environmental footprint due to high computational demands. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of agentic environments, a sustainability-oriented AI framework that extends beyond reactive systems by leveraging GenAI, multi-agent systems, and edge computing to reduce the environmental impact of technology. Agentic environments enable more efficient resource use, improved quality of life, and sustainability-by-design, while simultaneously enhancing data privacy through decentralized, edge-driven solutions. Drawing on secondary research as well as primary data from focus groups and semi-structured interviews with AI professionals from leading technology companies, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for agentic environments examined through three lenses: the personal sphere, professional and commercial use, and urban operations. The findings highlight the potential of agentic environments to foster sustainable ecosystems through optimized resource utilization and strengthened data privacy.

Accepted for publication in AI and Ethics", "summary": "In Artificial Intelligence (AI), language models have gained significant importance due to the widespread adoption of systems capable of simulating realistic conversations with humans through text generation. Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model.

Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation.

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u9020\u6210\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMEPIC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u6279\u6b21\u590d\u7528Chunk KV\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11HBM\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5e94\u7528\u5904\u7406\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684Prefix caching\u548cPIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMEPIC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06chunk KV\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5206\u9875\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5757\u7ea7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u4e2d\u7684RoPE\u878d\u5408\u53bb\u9664\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "MEPIC\u53ef\u6d88\u9664HBM\u4e2d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u590d\u7684Chunk KV\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709PIC\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\u7684HBM\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MEPIC\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

For example, underlying an action ``\\textit{report a witnessed crime}\" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as ``\\textit{It is expected to be brave to report crimes}''. Current AI systems that assess valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human actions by leveraging large-scale data training not grounded on explicit norms may be difficult to explain, and thus untrustworthy. Emulating human assessors by considering social norms can help AI models better understand and predict valence. While multiple norms come into play, conflicting norms can create tension and directly influence human behavior. For example, when deciding whether to ``\\textit{report a witnessed crime}'', one may balance \\textit{bravery} against \\textit{self-protection}. In this paper, we introduce \\textit{ClarityEthic}, a novel ethical assessment approach, to enhance valence prediction and explanation by generating conflicting social norms behind human actions, which strengthens the moral reasoning capabilities of language models by using a contrastive learning strategy.

For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines.

While algorithmic efficiency enhances evidence extraction, a research gap exists regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023's compatibility with adversarial AI threats, specifically anti-forensics and deepfakes. This study scrutinizes the AI \"dual-use\" dilemma, functioning as both a cyber-threat vector and forensic automation mechanism, to delineate privacy boundaries in high-stakes investigations. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the research synthesizes statutory analysis of the DPDP Act with global ethical frameworks (IEEE, EU) to evaluate regulatory efficacy. Preliminary results indicate that while Machine Learning offers high accuracy in pattern recognition, it introduces vulnerabilities regarding data poisoning and algorithmic bias. Findings highlight a critical tension between the Act's data minimization principles and forensic data retention requirements. Furthermore, the paper identifies that existing legal definitions inadequately encompass AI-driven \"tool crimes\" and \"target crimes.\" Consequently, the research proposes a \"human-centric\" forensic model prioritizing explainable AI (XAI) to ensure evidence admissibility.

LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively.

However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u786e\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff08KT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u786e\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff08KT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "KT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u7528\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5b66\u751f\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u7b7e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice.

This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting.

These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning \"blacks\" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the \"blacks\" label operates partially as a general \"racism detector\" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u9ed1\u4eba\u201d\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u201c\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u201d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u95fb\u7f16\u8f91\u5ba4\u91c7\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u9700\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u73b0\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u524d\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u201c\u9ed1\u4eba\u201d\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u201c\u9ed1\u4eba\u201d\u6807\u7b7e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u201c\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u95fb\u7f16\u8f91\u5ba4\u5728\u91c7\u7528AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u8981\u964d\u4f4e\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u4e2d\u91cd\u73b0\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08PostBC\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5fae\u8c03\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u6548\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6807\u51c6\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08PostBC\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "PostBC\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u8986\u76d6\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4e8eBC\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PostBC\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings.

This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training.

In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8c31\u8fb9\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5851\u9020\u7406\u60f3\u52a8\u6001\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6307\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7cfb\u7efc\uff0c\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u573a\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u89e3\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u8c31\u8fb9\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u76ae\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u6ce2\u4e0eSTDP\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u5747\u653e\u7535\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e86\u89e3\u5c11\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4f53\u5185\u8c03\u8282STDP\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u76ae\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u653e\u7535\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u76ae\u5c42\u884c\u6ce2\u7279\u70b9\u4ee5\u53ca\u884c\u6ce2\u4e0eSTDP\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u884c\u6ce2\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u523a\u6fc0\u7a81\u89e6\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6291\u5236\u6027\u53cd\u5f39\u4ea7\u751f\u53cd\u5411\u52a8\u4f5c\u7535\u4f4d\u6fc0\u6d3bSTDP\uff0c\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u6ce2\u548cSTDP\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u8d1f\u8d23\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u76ae\u5c42\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002"}}

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.\n  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).\n  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy.

While recent computational advances, such as diffusion models, can design high-affinity IDP binders, translating these to practical drug discovery requires autonomous systems capable of reasoning across complex conformational ensembles and orchestrating diverse computational tools at scale.To address this challenge, we designed and implemented StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system for designing biologics that can be used to target IDPs. StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy.

Owing to their unique combination of efficiency, scalability, and expressive capacity, SSMs have become compelling alternatives to transformer-based models, which suffer from the quadratic computational and memory costs of attention mechanisms. As SSMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is critical to assess their susceptibility to both software- and hardware-level threats to ensure secure and reliable operation. Among such threats, hardware-induced bit-flip attacks (BFAs) pose a particularly severe risk by corrupting model parameters through memory faults, thereby undermining model accuracy and functional integrity. To investigate this vulnerability, we introduce RAMBO, the first BFA framework specifically designed to target Mamba-based architectures. Through experiments on the Mamba-1.4b model with LAMBADA benchmark, a cloze-style word-prediction task, we demonstrate that flipping merely a single critical bit can catastrophically reduce accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increase perplexity from 18.94 to 3.75 x 10^6.

As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, NIDS must evolve to detect both emerging threats and deviations from normal behavior. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) methods to improve the NIDS accuracy through analyzing intricate structures in deep-featured network traffic records. Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na\u00efve Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN). Initial evaluations without hyper-parameter optimization demonstrated suboptimal performance, highlighting the importance of tuning to enhance classification accuracy. After hyper-parameter optimization using grid and random search techniques, the SVM classifier achieved 99.12% accuracy with a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate (FAR), outperforming its default configuration (98.08% accuracy, 0.0123 FAR) and all other classifiers.

Concretely, I wrap Mistral-7B-Instruct with modular jailbreak and malware system prompts plus a ModernBERT-based harmfulness classifier, then evaluate candidate configurations on three public benchmarks covering malware generation, classic jailbreak prompts, and benign user queries. Each configuration is scored using malware and jailbreak attack success rate, benign harmful-response rate, and end-to-end latency. A 48-point grid search over prompt combinations and filter modes establishes a baseline. I then run a black-box Optuna study over the same space and show that it reliably rediscovers the best grid configurations while requiring an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and roughly 8x less wall-clock time.

While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy.

The results reveal substantial gaps in bias across languages used in LLMs. For example, Arabic and Spanish consistently show higher levels of stereotype bias, while Chinese and English exhibit lower levels of bias. We also identify contrasting patterns across bias types.

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6Sage\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u88c1\u5224\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4f5c\u88c1\u5224\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-as-a-Judge\u57fa\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u7406\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u516c\u7406\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u6574\u7406\u542b650\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSage\u6307\u6807\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u88c1\u5224\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u677f\u7684\u88c1\u5224\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Sage\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30LLM-as-a-Judge\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4f5c\u88c1\u5224\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u975e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

The dataset includes vulnerability identifiers, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.0 scores, publication dates, and short textual descriptions. The primary objectives of this work are to identify trends in zero-day vulnerability disclosures, examine severity distributions across vendors, and investigate which vulnerability characteristics are most indicative of high severity. In addition, this study explores predictive modeling approaches for severity classification, comparing classical machine learning techniques with deep learning models using both structured metadata and unstructured textual descriptions.

However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns.

Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u60c5\u611f3D\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5fae\u5999\u60c5\u7eea\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u52a8\u753b\u4eab\u53d7\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba4\u53ef\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67092D\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u5f00\u5c55\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff08N=48\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a83D\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u60c5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5feb\u4e50\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6027\u52a8\u753b\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u4eab\u53d7\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u5206\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8ba4\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7eb3\u5165\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5fae\u5999\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Most studies have focused on building neural counterparts of traditional implicit representations of 3D geometries, such as signed distance functions. However, the triangle mesh-based representation of geometry remains the most widely used representation in the industry, while building INRs capable of generating them has been sparsely studied. In this paper, we present a method for building compact INRs of zero-genus 3D manifolds. Our method relies on creating a spherical parameterization of a given 3D mesh - mapping the surface of a mesh to that of a unit sphere - then constructing an INR that encodes the displacement vector field defined continuously on its surface that regenerates the original shape. The compactness of our representation can be attributed to its hierarchical structure, wherein it first recovers the coarse structure of the encoded surface before adding high-frequency details to it. Once the INR is computed, 3D meshes of arbitrary resolution/connectivity can be decoded from it. The decoding can be performed in real time while achieving a state-of-the-art trade-off between reconstruction quality and the size of the compressed representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u96f6\u4e8f\u683c3D\u6d41\u5f62\u7d27\u51d1\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387/\u8fde\u63a5\u60273D\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce83D\u51e0\u4f55\u4f20\u7edf\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5b83\u7684INR\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a3D\u7f51\u683c\u521b\u5efa\u7403\u5f62\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u9762\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u6784\u5efaINR\u7f16\u7801\u5176\u8868\u9762\u8fde\u7eed\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u4ee5\u518d\u751f\u539f\u59cb\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u5927\u5c0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u96f6\u4e8f\u683c3D\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u7d27\u51d1INR\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u5176\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387/\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\u3002"}}

They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized.

Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD.

Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model.

However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured \"thinking report\" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness.

Strategies like collaborative catalytic systems and multifunctional catalysts are effective but face challenges at the nanoscale. Carbon nanotube synthesis contains complicated nanoscale catalytic reactions, thus achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting CNTs demands innovative catalyst design. In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5165\u4f20\u7edf\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u5e76\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u5408\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5165\u4f20\u7edf\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa54\u79cd\u5019\u9009\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a3\u79cd\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff0c\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8d8591%\uff0cFeTiO3\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8fbe98.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

By modeling this ``bottleneck'' to summarize firm- and macro-level information, CB-APM not only predicts future risk premiums of U.S. equities but also links belief aggregation to expected returns in a structurally interpretable manner. The model improves long-horizon return forecasts and outperforms standard deep learning approaches in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power. Comprehensive portfolio analyses show that CB-APM's out-of-sample predictions translate into economically meaningful payoffs, with monotonic return differentials and stable long-short performance across regularization settings. Empirically, CB-APM leverages consensus as a regularizer to amplify long-horizon predictability and yields interpretable consensus-based components that clarify how information is priced in returns. Moreover, regression and GRS-based pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus representations capture priced variation only partially spanned by traditional factor models, demonstrating that CB-APM uncovers belief-driven structure in expected returns beyond the canonical factor space. Overall, CB-APM provides an interpretable and empirically grounded framework for understanding belief-driven return dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCB - APM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7f8e\u80a1\u98ce\u9669\u6ea2\u4ef7\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u4e2d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u8d44\u4ea7\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u5ff5\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Consensus - Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model (CB - APM) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u2018\u74f6\u9888\u2019\u603b\u7ed3\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u53d8\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "CB - APM\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits.

However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053\u50cf\u7d20\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6FLIM_PSR_k\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u5927\u50cf\u7d20\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387FLIM\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u80bf\u7624\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8FLIM\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFLIM\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u9a7b\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u53ca\u5206\u8fa8\u7387 - \u901f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08cGAN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3FLIM_PSR_k\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u80bf\u7624\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6837\u672c\u76f2\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cFLIM_PSR_k\u53ef\u9760\u5b9e\u73b0k = 5\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u79ef\u63d0\u9ad825\u500d\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "FLIM_PSR_k\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86FLIM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5bff\u547d\u6210\u50cf\u5411\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While prior black-box MIA techniques rely on confidence scores or token likelihoods, these signals are often entangled with a sample's intrinsic properties - such as content difficulty or rarity - leading to poor generalization and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose ICP-MIA, a novel MIA framework grounded in the theory of training dynamics, particularly the phenomenon of diminishing returns during optimization. We introduce the Optimization Gap as a fundamental signal of membership: at convergence, member samples exhibit minimal remaining loss-reduction potential, while non-members retain significant potential for further optimization. To estimate this gap in a black-box setting, we propose In-Context Probing (ICP), a training-free method that simulates fine-tuning-like behavior via strategically constructed input contexts. We propose two probing strategies: reference-data-based (using semantically similar public samples) and self-perturbation (via masking or generation).

Traditionally, scientists have made up for these shortcomings by designing phenomenological variables that take into account this historical dependence (typically, conformational tensors in fluids). Often, these phenomenological variables are not easily measurable experimentally. In this work, we study to what extent Transformer architectures are able to cope with the lack of experimental data on these variables. The methodology is evaluated on three benchmark problems: a cylinder flow with no history dependence, a viscoelastic Couette flow modeled via the Oldroyd-B formalism, and a non-linear polymeric fluid described by the FENE model. Our results show that the Transformer outperforms a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network with metriplectic bias in systems with missing experimental data, providing lower errors even in low-dimensional latent spaces. In contrast, for systems whose state variables can be fully known, the metriplectic model achieves superior performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5e94\u5bf9\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6709metriplectic\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u5168\u77e5\u65f6metriplectic\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3a\u5f25\u8865\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u96be\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u65e0\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5706\u67f1\u6d41\u3001\u7528Oldroyd - B\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u5e93\u57c3\u7279\u6d41\u3001\u7531FENE\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6d41\u4f53\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6709metriplectic\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u5168\u77e5\u65f6metriplectic\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u5168\u77e5\u65f6metriplectic\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.\n  Project page: https://qghuxmu.github.io/Sigma-MoE-Tiny\n  Code: https://github.com/microsoft/ltp-megatron-lm", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSigma - MoE - Tiny\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u8c03\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u578b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u5e26\u6765\u4e13\u5bb6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c42\u6700\u591a96\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u4e0d\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5cf0\u503c\uff1b\u4ec5\u6fc0\u6d3b0.5B\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9876\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Sigma - MoE - Tiny\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765MoE\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

As a result, this method is compatible with any mel-based vocoder without requiring any additional training or changes to the model. This is achieved by directly modifying the cepstrum feature space in order to shift the harmonic structure to the desired target. The spectrogram magnitude is computed via the pseudo-inverse mel transform, then converted to the cepstrum by applying DCT. In this domain, the cepstral peak is shifted without having to estimate its position and the modified mel is recomputed by applying IDCT and mel-filterbank.

However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration.

In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes.

However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Hierarchical Audio Transformer for robust infant cry classification. The model integrates causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, and adversarial domain generalization within a unified framework.\n  DACH-TIC employs a structured transformer backbone with local token-level and global semantic encoders, augmented by causal attention masking and controlled perturbation training to approximate counterfactual acoustic variations. A domain-adversarial objective promotes environment-invariant representations, while multi-task learning jointly optimizes cry type recognition, distress intensity estimation, and causal relevance prediction. The model is evaluated on the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets, with ESC-50 environmental noise overlays for domain augmentation.\n  Experimental results show that DACH-TIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer, achieving improvements of 2.6 percent in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, alongside enhanced causal fidelity.

This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models, built with the AMADEUS framework, successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Overall, this study highlights that, for lab-scale synthesis optimization, high-quality small datasets combined with classical, interpretable ML models outperform traditional statistical methods and are fully sufficient for quantitative synthesis prediction.

While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization.

Instead of proposing and analyzing MVR variants of Muon and Scion separately, we incorporate MVR into the recently proposed Gluon framework, which captures Muon, Scion and other specific Non-Euclidean LMO-based methods as special cases, and at the same time works with a more general smoothness assumption which better captures the layer-wise structure of neural networks.

Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation.\n  We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans).

However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning.

This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u679080\u79cdMLIPs\u5728\u591a\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u5178\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f73MLIP\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MLIPs\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u5e8f\u3001\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u5757\u72b6\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u5728\u591a\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u679080\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cMLIPs\u5728\u591a\u76f8\u50ac\u5316\u5178\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840MLIPs\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f1b\u8c6b\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u80fd\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73MLIPs\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u5355\u4e00MLIP\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u5e94\u7528\u8003\u5bdfMLIP\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds.

However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624.

In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_\u03b3$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI.

In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted.

We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech.

Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization.

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art.

Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments.

Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14 - 3j \u548c\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14 - nj \u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u6269\u5c55 e3nn \u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0 MACE\u3001NequIP \u548c Allegro \u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5bf9\u5e94\u7248\u672c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd8\u4ee5 TACE \u4e3a\u4f8b\u8003\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u7403\u5f20\u91cf\uff08ST\uff09\u6784\u9020\u662f\u5426\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14 - 3j \u548c\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14 - nj \u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u6269\u5c55 e3nn \u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5bf9\u5e94\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5 TACE \u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8003\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u548c\u7403\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86 Python \u5305 cartnn\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u5bf9\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u548c\u7403\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u8003\u5bdf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u548c\u6536\u7f29\u6784\u9020\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains.

Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance.

The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth.

Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space.

Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction.

Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models.

This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous.

While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically -- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\\%$, a $1.4\\times$ improvement over SOTA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGinSign\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5c06\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u539f\u5b50\u63a5\u5730\u6216\u63a5\u5730\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGinSign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u63a5\u5730\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4ece\u81ea\u7531\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u672a\u63a5\u5730\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684LTL\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0cGinSign\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u63a5\u5730\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u5f97\u520695.5%\uff0c\u6bd4SOTA\u63d0\u53471.4\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GinSign\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks.

While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers.

However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u9632\u5fa1AI XR\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5934\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "AI XR\u6280\u672f\u867d\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc6\u522bAI XR\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6655\u52a8\u75c7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06MIA\u548cRDA\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e43%\u548c39%\uff0cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe97%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u7ea62\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5982GenEval \u5df2\u504f\u79bb\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6GenEval 2\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5Soft - TIFA\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3T2I\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5982GenEval\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6GenEval 2 \uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u591a\u57fa\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5Soft - TIFA\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u8bed\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6GenEval 2\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0cSoft - TIFA\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4e0d\u6613\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867dGenEval 2\u6709\u671b\u957f\u671f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u907f\u514d\u57fa\u51c6\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9T2I\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors.

On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model.

To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAuditDM\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u662f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gemma - 3\u548cPaliGemma - 2\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u8d8520\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u572816\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\uff0c3B\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a28B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u65f6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
