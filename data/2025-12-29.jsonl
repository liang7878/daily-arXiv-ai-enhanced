However, their tendency to generate executable SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries introduces a hidden risk, as outputs may be misinterpreted as correct. This risk is especially serious in biomedical contexts, where precision is critical. We therefore present Query Carefully, a pipeline that integrates LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection and handling of unanswerable inputs. Building on the OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark, we construct OncoMX-NAQ (No-Answer Questions), a set of 80 no-answer questions spanning 8 categories (non-SQL, out-of-schema/domain, and multiple ambiguity types). Our approach employs llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples drawn from both answerable and unanswerable questions. We evaluate SQL exact match, result accuracy, and unanswerable-detection accuracy. On the OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples increases result accuracy, and adding unanswerable examples does not degrade performance. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves the highest unanswerable-detection accuracy (0.8), with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories (non-SQL, missing columns, out-of-domain) but persistent challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3). A lightweight user interface surfaces interim SQL, execution results, and abstentions, supporting transparent and reliable text-to-SQL in biomedical applications."}

However, prevailing approaches either deploy LLMs as standalone recommender or apply global knowledge distillation, both of which suffer from inherent drawbacks. Standalone LLM recommender are costly, biased, and unreliable across large regions of the user item space, while global distillation forces the downstream model to imitate LLM predictions even when such guidance is inaccurate. Meanwhile, recent studies show that LLMs excel particularly in re-ranking and challenging scenarios, rather than uniformly across all contexts.We introduce Selective LLM Guided Regularization, a model-agnostic and computation efficient framework that activates LLM based pairwise ranking supervision only when a trainable gating mechanism informing by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty predicts the LLM to be reliable. All LLM scoring is performed offline, transferring knowledge without increasing inference cost. Experiments across multiple datasets show that this selective strategy consistently improves overall accuracy and yields substantial gains in cold start and long tail regimes, outperforming global distillation baselines."}

We first give a construction for answering arbitrary workloads of weighted marginal queries, over arbitrary domains. Our technique is based on releasing queries in the Fourier basis with independent noise with carefully calibrated variances, and reconstructing the marginal query answers using the inverse Fourier transform. We show that our algorithm, which is a factorization mechanism, is exactly optimal among all factorization mechanisms, both for minimizing the sum of weighted noise variances, and for minimizing the maximum noise variance. Unlike algorithms based on optimizing over all factorization mechanisms via semidefinite programming, our mechanism runs in time polynomial in the dataset and the output size. This construction recovers results of Xiao et al. [Neurips 2023] with a simpler algorithm and optimality proof, and a better running time.\n  We then extend our approach to a generalization of marginals which we refer to as product queries. We show that our algorithm is still exactly optimal for this more general class of queries. Finally, we show how to embed extended marginal queries, which allow using a threshold predicate on numerical attributes, into product queries. We show that our mechanism is almost optimal among all factorization mechanisms for extended marginals, in the sense that it achieves the optimal (maximum or average) noise variance up to lower order terms."}

This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II. Finally, we investigate how retail competition affects the cooperative alliance's optimal strategy and channel performance. Our identified properties derived from the equilibrium and numerical analyses offer crucial insights for participants engaged in cooperative advertising within the SEA market."}

In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension.

This paper compares excess-of-loss indemnity insurance with parametric insurance within a common mean-variance framework, allowing for fixed costs, heterogeneous premium loadings, and binding budget constraints. We show that, once these realistic frictions are introduced, parametric insurance can yield higher welfare for risk-averse individuals, even under the same utility objective. The welfare advantage arises precisely when indemnity insurance becomes impractical, and disappears once both contracts are unconstrained. Our results help reconcile classical insurance theory with the growing use of parametric risk transfer in high-risk settings."}

This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM=S \\oplus S^{\\perp}$), where S represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), denoted as $G_f$, which is a finite-dimensional and computable representative of information extractable from the manifold's geometry. Indeed, by proving the Trace Theorem: $H_G(f)=\\text{Tr}(G_f)$, we establish a rigorous foundation for the G-entropy previously introduced by us, thereby identifying it not merely as a gradient-based regularizer, but also as a fundamental geometric invariant representing the total explainable statistical information captured by the probability distribution associated with the model. Furthermore, we establish a link between $G_f$ and the second-order derivative (i.e. the curvature) of the KL-divergence, leading to the notion of Covariate Cramér-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB). We demonstrate that $G_f$ is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, thereby providing fundamental limits of variance for semi-parametric estimators. Finally, we apply our geometric framework to the Manifold Hypothesis, lifting the latter from a heuristic assumption into a testable condition of rank-deficiency within the cFIM. By defining the Information Capture Ratio, we provide a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data. In short, our work bridges the gap between abstract information geometry and the demand of explainable AI, by providing a tractable path for revealing the statistical coverage and the efficiency of non-parametric models."}

This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing."}

The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing."}

A central open question in this area is the existence of EFX allocations-allocations in which any envy of any agent i towards any agent j vanishes upon the removal of any single good from j's bundle. Establishing the existence of such allocations has proven notoriously difficult in general, but progress has been made for restricted valuation classes. Christodoulou et al. [2023] proved existence for graphical valuations, where goods correspond to edges in a graph, agents to nodes, and each agent values only incident edges. The graph was required to be simple, i.e., for any pair of agents, there could be at most one good that both agents value. The problem remained open, however, for multi-graph valuations, where for a pair of agents several goods may have value to both. In this setting, Sgouritsa and Sotiriou [2025] established existence whenever the shortest cycle with non-parallel edges has length at least six, while Afshinmehr et al. [2025] proved existence when the graph contains no odd cycles. In this paper, we strengthen these results by proving that EFX allocations always exist in multi-graphs that contain no cycle of length three. Assuming monotone valuations, we further provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for computing such an allocation, which runs in polynomial time when agents have cancelable valuations, a strict superclass of additive valuation functions. Accordingly, our results stand as one of the only cases where EFX allocations exist for an arbitrary number of agents."}

Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ."}

Recognizing fairness explicitly as a software quality dimension yields practical benefits beyond ethical considerations, notably improved predictive performance for unprivileged groups, enhanced out-of-distribution generalization, and increased geographic transferability in real-world deployments. Nevertheless, existing bias mitigation methods face a critical dilemma: while pre-processing methods offer broad applicability across model types, they generally fall short in effectiveness compared to post-processing techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach designed to mitigate bias by adjusting data correlations. Specifically, CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels, and employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT increases the true positive rate of unprivileged groups by an average of 17.5% and reduces three key bias metrics, including statistical parity difference (SPD), average odds difference (AOD), and equal opportunity difference (EOD), by more than 50% on average. CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by three and ten percentage points in single attribute and multiple attributes scenarios, respectively. We will publicly release our experimental results and source code to facilitate future research."}

As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps."}

This interdisciplinary approach, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), can be seen as an algebraic dual to the traditional set-theoretic framework of the DS theory, with its algebraic structure enabling the extension of some DS theory concepts to stochastic dynamics. Moreover, it reveals the presence of a topological supersymmetry (TS) in the GTOs of all SDEs. It also shows that among the various definitions of chaos, positive \"pressure\", defined as the logarithm of the GTO spectral radius, stands out as particularly meaningful from a physical perspective, as it corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of TS on the TFT side. Via the Goldstone theorem, this definition has a potential to provide the long-sought explanation for the experimental signature of chaotic dynamics known as 1/f noise. Additionally, STS clarifies that among the various existing interpretations of SDEs, only the Stratonovich interpretation yields evolution operators that match the corresponding GTOs and, consequently, have a clear-cut mathematical meaning. Here, we discuss these and other aspects of STS from both the DS theory and TFT perspectives, focusing on links between these two fields and providing mathematical concepts with physical interpretations that may be useful in some contexts."}

This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead."}

Research to enhance I2I performance focuses on two directions: 1) model-centric approaches, which adopt deeper architectures but risk increased computational costs and deployment complexity, and 2) data-centric methods, which refine training data without altering models, offering cost-effectiveness but struggling with data sparsity and noise. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-I2I, a data-centric framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate data quality issues. LLM-I2I includes (1) an LLM-based generator that synthesizes user-item interactions for long-tail items, alleviating data sparsity, and (2) an LLM-based discriminator that filters noisy interactions from real and synthetic data. The refined data is then fused to train I2I models. Evaluated on industry (AEDS) and academic (ARD) datasets, LLM-I2I consistently improves recommendation accuracy, particularly for long-tail items. Deployed on a large-scale cross-border e-commerce platform, it boosts recall number (RN) by 6.02% and gross merchandise value (GMV) by 1.22% over existing I2I models. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing data-centric recommendation systems without modifying model architectures."}

They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models."}

The approach, Tilt Matching, arises from a dynamical equation relating the flow matching velocity to one targeting the same distribution tilted by a reward, implicitly solving a stochastic optimal control problem. The new velocity inherits the regularity of stochastic interpolant transports while also being the minimizer of an objective with strictly lower variance than flow matching itself. The update to the velocity field can be interpreted as the sum of all joint cumulants of the stochastic interpolant and copies of the reward, and to first order is their covariance. The algorithms do not require any access to gradients of the reward or backpropagating through trajectories of the flow or diffusion. We empirically verify that the approach is efficient and highly scalable, providing state-of-the-art results on sampling under Lennard-Jones potentials and is competitive on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, without requiring reward multipliers. It can also be straightforwardly applied to tilting few-step flow map models."}

Using historical S and P 500 daily data, we evaluate fidelity (Maximum Mean Discrepancy, MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation and volatility clustering), and practical utility in downstream tasks, specifically mean-variance portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting. Empirical results indicate that ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; and TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (e.g., TimeGAN attained the lowest MMD: 1.84e-3, average over 5 seeds).

While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality.

In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale."}

Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions."}

The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains.

The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware.

However, their integration lacks systematic empirical evaluation: practitioners typically deploy LVLMs as fixed black-box feature extractors without systematically comparing alternative representation strategies. To address this gap, we present the first systematic empirical study along two key design dimensions: (i) integration strategies with ID embeddings, specifically replacement versus fusion, and (ii) feature extraction paradigms, comparing LVLM-generated captions with intermediate decoder hidden states. Extensive experiments on representative LVLMs reveal three key principles: (1) intermediate hidden states consistently outperform caption-based representations, as natural-language summarization inevitably discards fine-grained visual semantics crucial for recommendation; (2) ID embeddings capture irreplaceable collaborative signals, rendering fusion strictly superior to replacement; and (3) the effectiveness of intermediate decoder features varies significantly across layers. Guided by these insights, we propose the Dual Feature Fusion (DFF) Framework, a lightweight and plug-and-play approach that adaptively fuses multi-layer representations from frozen LVLMs with item ID embeddings. DFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on two real-world micro-video recommendation benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines and providing a principled approach to integrating off-the-shelf large vision-language models into micro-video recommender systems."}

Owing to the observability of unconfirmed transactions, a strategic user can postpone his transaction broadcasting time and set a fee as low as possible by prying into his mempool that stores them. However, the stochastic mining interval may cause the delayed transaction to miss the next valid block. Meanwhile, a new feature (i.e. fee bumping) emerges that allows each user to increase his transaction fee before confirmation, making the fee setting more challenging. In this paper, we investigate a novel transaction policy from the perspective of a single strategic user that determines the broadcasting time and the transaction fee simultaneously. Two representative scenarios are considered, in which a number of coexisting ordinary users are mempool-oblivious that set their fees according to certain distribution, and are semi-strategic that check their mempools at a Poisson rate and update their fees. In the former, we compute the optimal broadcasting time and transaction fee that adapts to the arbitrary distribution of mining interval. When the block interval is exponentially distributed in Bitcoin-like PoW systems, the strategic user needs to broadcast his transaction immediately after its creation. And when the block interval is fixed in Ethereum-like PoS systems, he finds it profitable to wait until the last moment before block generation. In the latter, we formulate a continuous-time Markov chain to characterize the dynamics of mempool states, and derive the optimal fee adjusting frequency of the strategic user when the block interval is exponentially distributed. In both theory and simulations, we show that this strategic user should immediately increase his fee whenever it falls behind the minimum fee of being included."}

However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training."}

In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively.

Using a novel dataset linking Small Business Administration (SBA) loan records with Dun and Bradstreet microdata for over 26 million U.S. firms, I investigate whether prior participation in the SBA 7(a) program acted as a gateway to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Employing entropy balancing to construct a strictly comparable counterfactual group, I document a distinct dynamic evolution in credit rationing. In the program's initial \"panic phase\" in April 2020, banks relied heavily on legacy ties as a screening technology: firms with prior 7(a) relationships were approximately 29 percentage points more likely to receive funding than observationally identical non-7(a) firms. By June 2021, however, this insider advantage had largely vanished, suggesting that policy adjustments and extended timelines eventually mitigated the initial intermediation frictions. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between speed and equity in crisis response. While leveraging existing credit rails accelerates deployment, it systematically excludes informationally opaque borrowers. I discuss policy implications for designing future digital infrastructure to decouple verification from historical lending relationships."}

We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing."}

Earlier version available on SSRN (10.2139/ssrn.5751205)", "summary": "This article examines how legacy lending relationships shape the allocation of emergency credit under severe information frictions. Using a novel dataset linking Small Business Administration (SBA) loan records with Dun and Bradstreet microdata for over 26 million U.S. firms, I investigate whether prior participation in the SBA 7(a) program acted as a gateway to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Employing entropy balancing to construct a strictly comparable counterfactual group, I document a distinct dynamic evolution in credit rationing. In the program's initial \"panic phase\" in April 2020, banks relied heavily on legacy ties as a screening technology: firms with prior 7(a) relationships were approximately 29 percentage points more likely to receive funding than observationally identical non-7(a) firms. By June 2021, however, this insider advantage had largely vanished, suggesting that policy adjustments and extended timelines eventually mitigated the initial intermediation frictions. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between speed and equity in crisis response. While leveraging existing credit rails accelerates deployment, it systematically excludes informationally opaque borrowers. I discuss policy implications for designing future digital infrastructure to decouple verification from historical lending relationships."}

This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II. Finally, we investigate how retail competition affects the cooperative alliance's optimal strategy and channel performance. Our identified properties derived from the equilibrium and numerical analyses offer crucial insights for participants engaged in cooperative advertising within the SEA market."}

Our proposal is a volume discount auction with a Farmer Collective (FC) as the selling agent and high volume or retail consumers as buying agents. An FC is a cooperative of farmers coming together to harness the power of aggregation and economies of scale. Our auction mechanism seeks to satisfy fundamental properties such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality, and an extremely relevant property for the agriculture setting, namely, Nash social welfare maximization. Besides satisfying these properties, our proposed auction mechanism also ensures that certain practical business constraints are met. Since an auction satisfying all of these properties exactly is a theoretical impossibility, we invoke the idea of designing deep learning networks that learn such an auction with minimal violation of the desired properties. The proposed auction, which we call VDA-SAP (Volume Discount Auction for Selling Agricultural Produce), is superior in many ways to the classical VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism in terms of richness of properties satisfied and further outperforms other baseline auctions as well. We demonstrate our results for a realistic setting of an FC selling perishable vegetables to potential buyers."}

In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments."}

Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1.

However, the performance of AI-agents and LLMs heavily depends on the input they receive. For instance, a GitHub issue that is unclear or not well scoped might not lead to a successful implementation that will eventually be merged. GitHub Copilot provides a set of best practice recommendations that are limited and high-level. In this paper, we build a set of 32 detailed criteria that we leverage to measure the quality of GitHub issues to make them suitable for AI-agents. We compare the GitHub issues that lead to a merged pull request versus closed pull request. Then, we build an interpretable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a GitHub issue resulting in a merged pull request. We observe that pull requests that end up being merged are those originating from issues that are shorter, well scoped, with clear guidance and hints about the relevant artifacts for an issue, and with guidance on how to perform the implementation. Issues with external references including configuration, context setup, dependencies or external APIs are associated with lower merge rates. We built an interpretable machine learning model to help users identify how to improve a GitHub issue to increase the chances of the issue resulting in a merged pull request by Copilot. Our model has a median AUC of 72\\%. Our results shed light on quality metrics relevant for writing GitHub issues and motivate future studies further investigate the writing of GitHub issues as a first-class software engineering activity in the era of AI-teammates."}

However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP"}

A portion of the radio spectrum has been reserved for institutions using it for non-commercial purposes such as federal agencies, defense, public safety bodies and scientific institutions. In order to operate efficiently, these incumbents need clean spectrum access. However, commercial users also want access, and granting them access may materially interfere with the existing activity of the incumbents. Conventional market based mechanisms for allocating scarce resources in this context are problematic. Allowing direct monetary transfers to and from public or scientific institutions risks distorting their non-commercial mission. Moreover, often only the incumbent knows the exact value of the interference it experiences, and, likewise, only commercial users can predict accurately the expected monetary outcome from sharing the resource. Thus, our problem is to determine the efficient allocation of resources in the presence of private information without the use of direct monetary transfers. The problem is not unique to spectrum. Other resources that governments hold in trust share the same feature. We propose a novel mechanism design formulation of the problem, characterize the optimal mechanism and describe some of its qualitative properties."}

However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\\times$ and 3.7$\\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy."}

When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance. Our work thus presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets."}

Cerberus uses LLMs to generate the inputs that trigger runtime errors and to perform code coverage prediction and error detection without code execution. With a two-phase feedback loop, Cerberus first aims to both increasing code coverage and detecting runtime errors, then shifts to focus only detecting runtime errors when the coverage reaches 100% or its maximum, enabling it to perform better than prompting the LLMs for both purposes. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Cerberus performs better than conventional and learning-based testing frameworks for (in)complete code snippets by generating high-coverage test cases more efficiently, leading to the discovery of more runtime errors."}

Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.\n  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed \"world\" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models."}

Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access."}

Rather than conducting separate phases for generating a large corpus and subsequently minimizing it, we propose FuzzWise which integrates them into one process to generate the optimal initial corpus of seeds (ICS). FuzzWise leverages a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The first LLM agent generates test cases for the target program. The second LLM agent, which functions as a predictive code coverage module, assesses whether each generated test case will enhance the overall coverage of the current corpus. The streamlined process allows each newly generated test seed to be immediately evaluated for its contribution to the overall coverage. FuzzWise employs a predictive approach using an LLM and eliminates the need for actual execution, saving computational resources and time, particularly in scenarios where the execution is not desirable or even impossible. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FuzzWise generates significantly fewer test cases than baseline methods. Despite the lower number of test cases, FuzzWise achieves high code coverage and triggers more runtime errors compared to the baselines. Moreover, it is more time-efficient and coverage-efficient in producing an initial corpus catching more errors."}

If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards."}

While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\\times$, $4.64\\times$ and $4.9\\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs."}

The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology.

Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization."}

Traditional methods, such as static logging and post-crash analysis, lack real-time contextual information, rendering them ineffective against \"ghost bugs\" that only manifest in specific scenarios. This highlights an urgent need for dynamic runtime observability: intercepting and tracing arbitrary methods in production without requiring an app release. We propose XTrace, a novel dynamic tracing framework. XTrace introduces a new paradigm of non-invasive proxying, which avoids direct modification of the virtual machine's underlying data structures. It achieves high-performance method interception by leveraging and optimizing the highly stable, built-in instrumentation mechanism of the Android ART virtual machine. Evaluated in a ByteDance application with hundreds of millions of daily active users, XTrace demonstrated production-grade stability and performance. Large-scale online A/B experiments confirmed its stability, showing no statistically significant impact (p > 0.05) on Crash User Rate or ANR rate, while maintaining minimal overhead (<7 ms startup latency, <0.01 ms per-method call) and broad compatibility (Android 5.0-15+). Critically, XTrace diagnosed over 11 severe online crashes and multiple performance bottlenecks, improving root-cause localization efficiency by over 90%. This confirms XTrace provides a production-grade solution that reconciles the long-standing conflict between stability and comprehensive coverage in Android dynamic tracing."}

We evaluate RLSyn on two biomedical datasets - AI-READI and MIMIC-IV- and benchmark it against state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion-based methods across extensive privacy, utility, and fidelity evaluations. RL-Syn performs comparably to diffusion models and outperforms GANs on MIMIC-IV, while outperforming both diffusion models and GANs on the smaller AI-READI dataset.

FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path.

We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL.

While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction."}

These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to an 84.5% improvement in schedulability on average."}

To select the most compatible parser for a specific system, multiple evaluation metrics are commonly used for performance comparisons. However, existing evaluation metrics heavily rely on labeled log data, which limits prior studies to a fixed set of datasets and hinders parser evaluations and selections in the industry. Further, we discovered that different versions of ground-truth used in existing studies can lead to inconsistent performance conclusions. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel label-free template-level metric, PMSS (parser medoid silhouette score), to evaluate log parser performance. PMSS evaluates both parser grouping and template quality with medoid silhouette analysis and Levenshtein distance within a near-linear time complexity in general. To understand its relationship with label-based template-level metrics, FGA and FTA, we compared their evaluation outcomes for six log parsers on the standard corrected Loghub 2.0 dataset. Our results indicate that log parsers achieving the highest PMSS or FGA exhibit comparable performance, differing by only 2.1% on average in terms of the FGA score; the difference is 9.8% for FTA. PMSS is also significantly (p<1e-8) and positively correlated to both FGA and FTA: the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient of PMSS-FGA and PMSS-FTA are respectively 0.648 and 0.587, close to the coefficient between FGA and FTA (0.670). We further extended our discussion on how to interpret the conclusions from different metrics, identifying challenges in using PMSS, and provided guidelines on conducting parser selections with our metric.

Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \\texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models."}

Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware.

We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents."}

We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%."}

We develop a general equivariance toolbox that yields coupled first- and second-order constraints on learning dynamics. The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure. We illustrate the framework through several applications, recovering known results while also deriving new characterizations that connect transformation structure to modern empirical observations about optimization geometry."}

Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects.

There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program. The prototype is implemented on the Windows platform. The validity and performance of the framework are verified by a large number of experiments with benchmark and actual programs.

Under review / to be submitted to a conference", "summary": "Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods."}

Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments.

Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions."}

Reflection-Driven Control elevates \"self-reflection\" from a post hoc patch into an explicit step in the agent's own reasoning process: during generation, the agent continuously runs an internal reflection loop that monitors and evaluates its own decision path. When potential risks are detected, the system retrieves relevant repair examples and secure coding guidelines from an evolving reflective memory, injecting these evidence-based constraints directly into subsequent reasoning steps. We instantiate Reflection-Driven Control in the setting of secure code generation and systematically evaluate it across eight classes of security-critical programming tasks. Empirical results show that Reflection-Driven Control substantially improves the security and policy compliance of generated code while largely preserving functional correctness, with minimal runtime and token overhead.

A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank-a critical parameter governing model complexity-is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals. We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RR-FBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches.

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences.

This paper conducts the first systematic exploration of a critical and stealthy threat: backdoor attacks targeting the retriever component, which represents a significant supply-chain vulnerability. It is infeasible to assess this threat realistically, as existing attack methods are either too ineffective to pose a real danger or are easily detected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms spanning both latent-space analysis and token-level inspection, which achieve consistently high detection rates. To overcome this barrier and enable a realistic analysis, we first developed VenomRACG, a new class of potent and stealthy attack that serves as a vehicle for our investigation. Its design makes poisoned samples statistically indistinguishable from benign code, allowing the attack to consistently maintain low detectability across all evaluated defense mechanisms. Armed with this capability, our exploration reveals a severe vulnerability: by injecting vulnerable code equivalent to only 0.05% of the entire knowledge base size, an attacker can successfully manipulate the backdoored retriever to rank the vulnerable code in its top-5 results in 51.29% of cases. This translates to severe downstream harm, causing models like GPT-4o to generate vulnerable code in over 40% of targeted scenarios, while leaving the system's general performance intact. Our findings establish that retriever backdooring is not a theoretical concern but a practical threat to the software development ecosystem that current defenses are blind to, highlighting the urgent need for robust security measures."}

In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training.

In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale."}

Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark."}

Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns."}

However, their tendency to generate executable SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries introduces a hidden risk, as outputs may be misinterpreted as correct. This risk is especially serious in biomedical contexts, where precision is critical. We therefore present Query Carefully, a pipeline that integrates LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection and handling of unanswerable inputs. Building on the OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark, we construct OncoMX-NAQ (No-Answer Questions), a set of 80 no-answer questions spanning 8 categories (non-SQL, out-of-schema/domain, and multiple ambiguity types). Our approach employs llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples drawn from both answerable and unanswerable questions. We evaluate SQL exact match, result accuracy, and unanswerable-detection accuracy. On the OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples increases result accuracy, and adding unanswerable examples does not degrade performance. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves the highest unanswerable-detection accuracy (0.8), with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories (non-SQL, missing columns, out-of-domain) but persistent challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3).

Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM. However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks."}

Recognizing fairness explicitly as a software quality dimension yields practical benefits beyond ethical considerations, notably improved predictive performance for unprivileged groups, enhanced out-of-distribution generalization, and increased geographic transferability in real-world deployments. Nevertheless, existing bias mitigation methods face a critical dilemma: while pre-processing methods offer broad applicability across model types, they generally fall short in effectiveness compared to post-processing techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach designed to mitigate bias by adjusting data correlations. Specifically, CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels, and employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT increases the true positive rate of unprivileged groups by an average of 17.5% and reduces three key bias metrics, including statistical parity difference (SPD), average odds difference (AOD), and equal opportunity difference (EOD), by more than 50% on average. CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by three and ten percentage points in single attribute and multiple attributes scenarios, respectively. We will publicly release our experimental results and source code to facilitate future research."}

Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches."}

Specifically, we examine the Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) and its accelerated Fast ISTA (FISTA) variant as candidates for algorithm rediscovery.

However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments."}

Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging."}

Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that introduce carefully crafted feature-level perturbations to evade detection while preserving malicious functionality. In this paper, we present LAMLAD, a novel adversarial attack framework that exploits the generative and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to bypass ML-based Android malware classifiers. LAMLAD employs a dual-agent architecture composed of an LLM manipulator, which generates realistic and functionality-preserving feature perturbations, and an LLM analyzer, which guides the perturbation process toward successful evasion. To improve efficiency and contextual awareness, LAMLAD integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into the LLM pipeline. Focusing on Drebin-style feature representations, LAMLAD enables stealthy and high-confidence attacks against widely deployed Android malware detection systems. We evaluate LAMLAD against three representative ML-based Android malware detectors and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMLAD achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of up to 97%, requiring on average only three attempts per adversarial sample, highlighting its effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability in practical adversarial settings. Furthermore, we propose an adversarial training-based defense strategy that reduces the ASR by more than 30% on average, significantly enhancing model robustness against LAMLAD-style attacks."}

However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior.

This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.\n  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours."}

However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates that videos can support extremely sample-efficient visual policy learning, without the need to access any other expert supervision."}

We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions.

Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments."}

Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \\texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models."}

The framework follows a two-stage process: the initial XGBoost model is built using raw data, and once selected as the final model, the dataset is cleaned by (1) removing multicollinear features, (2) identifying outliers with Isolation Forest, and (3) selecting important features using SHAP analysis. The refined dataset as model 2 is then used to retrain XGBoost, which achieves high prediction accuracy across all outputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed to support material designers. Overall, the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy and minimizes the need for extensive experimental testing in UHPC mix design."}

Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost.

Existing datasets contain few candidate responses per prompt, expose popularity signals during ratings, and lack objective and comparable metrics for funniness. Thus, we introduce Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus, which are a benchmark and dataset designed to enable rigorous evaluation of humor understanding in LLMs. Each prompt is paired with approximately 100 diverse candidate responses, and funniness is rated independently by approximately 100 human judges without access to others' ratings, reducing popularity bias and enabling robust aggregation. Using Oogiri-Corpus, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the linguistic factors associated with funniness, such as text length, ambiguity, and incongruity resolution, and derive objective metrics for predicting human judgments.

To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \\(\\pm\\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead."}

However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\\%--18\\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation."}

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.\n  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.\n  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades. DT-GAN is not proposed as a universal replacement for neural GANs, but as a principled adversarial alternative for data distributions that admit sparse synthesis structure.

Meanwhile, recent studies show that LLMs excel particularly in re-ranking and challenging scenarios, rather than uniformly across all contexts.We introduce Selective LLM Guided Regularization, a model-agnostic and computation efficient framework that activates LLM based pairwise ranking supervision only when a trainable gating mechanism informing by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty predicts the LLM to be reliable. All LLM scoring is performed offline, transferring knowledge without increasing inference cost.

In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods."}

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\\%$ of API costs."}

Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines."}

We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy.

Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers.

Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks.

We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.\n  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed \"world\" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models."}

As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps."}

The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \\texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups."}

This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.\n  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk.

Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

To enable this goal, we curate MMCMR-427K, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal CMR k-space database to date, comprising 427,465 multi-coil k-space data paired with structured metadata across 13 international centers, 12 CMR modalities, 15 scanners, and 17 CVD categories in populations across three continents.

However, these schemes generally add to underlying language model complexity and force large changes to architecture, making them hard to implement at large scales. To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE. Interestingly, if we use BPE with a smaller vocabulary, such that the compression is equivalent between GQ-VAE and BPE, we find that GQ-VAE improves downstream language model learning.

Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential."}

Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

In contrast, broad classes of DP and MILP algorithms require exponential time before attaining comparable solution quality. This establishes a rigorous probabilistic anytime separation in favor of sparse relaxations, even though exact methods remain ultimately optimal."}

If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards."}

To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned.

However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations.

However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs.

To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness.

By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method."}

Capturing this causal pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that enables reasoning over conversational behaviors by modeling this process as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a hybrid corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich simulations with human-annotated rationales and real conversational speech. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a multimodal transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems."}

While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning.

Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$β$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro.

This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes."}

Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels.

Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.\n  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization."}

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\\%$ of API costs."}

The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality.

In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations.

This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful.

In the context of surgery, for example, genomic variables are covariates and the skill of a particular surgeon is a version of treatment. There may be hidden versions of treatment, and this paper addresses that concern with a new kind of sensitivity analysis.

Bors"], "title": "Inference-based GAN Video Generation", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences."}

However, current laboratory and point-of-care testing systems are limited by long turnaround times, narrow dynamic ranges for the tested biomarkers, and single-analyte formats that fail to capture the complexity of cardiovascular disease. Here, we present a deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) with a portable optical reader and a neural network-based quantification pipeline. This optical sensor integrates colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection within a single paper-based cartridge to complementarily cover a large dynamic range (spanning ~6 orders of magnitude) for both low- and high-abundance biomarkers, while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Using 50 uL of serum, the optical sensor simultaneously quantifies cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 23 min. The xVFA achieves sub-pg/mL sensitivity for cTnI and sub-ng/mL sensitivity for CK-MB and NT-proBNP, spanning the clinically relevant ranges for these biomarkers. Neural network models trained and blindly tested on 92 patient serum samples yielded a robust quantification performance (Pearson's r > 0.96 vs. reference assays).

The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent."}

For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems."}

Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better.

A typical example is to detect runtime exceptions in online code snippets before integrating them into a codebase.

Cerberus uses LLMs to generate the inputs that trigger runtime errors and to perform code coverage prediction and error detection without code execution. With a two-phase feedback loop, Cerberus first aims to both increasing code coverage and detecting runtime errors, then shifts to focus only detecting runtime errors when the coverage reaches 100% or its maximum, enabling it to perform better than prompting the LLMs for both purposes. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Cerberus performs better than conventional and learning-based testing frameworks for (in)complete code snippets by generating high-coverage test cases more efficiently, leading to the discovery of more runtime errors."}

This paper examines the use of generative models, in particular TimeGAN and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for creating synthetic return series that support portfolio construction, trading analysis, and risk modeling. Using historical daily returns from the S and P 500 as a benchmark, we generate synthetic datasets under comparable market conditions and evaluate them using statistical similarity metrics, temporal structure tests, and downstream financial tasks. The study shows that TimeGAN produces synthetic data with distributional shapes, volatility patterns, and autocorrelation behaviour that are close to those observed in real returns. When applied to mean-variance portfolio optimization, the resulting synthetic datasets lead to portfolio weights, Sharpe ratios, and risk levels that remain close to those obtained from real data. The VAE provides more stable training but tends to smooth extreme market movements, which affects risk estimation. Finally, the analysis supports the use of synthetic datasets as substitutes for real financial data in portfolio analysis and risk simulation, particularly when models are able to capture temporal dynamics. Synthetic data therefore provides a privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for financial experimentation and model development."}

To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities.

FuzzWise leverages a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The first LLM agent generates test cases for the target program. The second LLM agent, which functions as a predictive code coverage module, assesses whether each generated test case will enhance the overall coverage of the current corpus. The streamlined process allows each newly generated test seed to be immediately evaluated for its contribution to the overall coverage. FuzzWise employs a predictive approach using an LLM and eliminates the need for actual execution, saving computational resources and time, particularly in scenarios where the execution is not desirable or even impossible. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FuzzWise generates significantly fewer test cases than baseline methods. Despite the lower number of test cases, FuzzWise achieves high code coverage and triggers more runtime errors compared to the baselines.

The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \\texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks.

This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM=S \\oplus S^{\\perp}$), where S represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), denoted as $G_f$, which is a finite-dimensional and computable representative of information extractable from the manifold's geometry. Indeed, by proving the Trace Theorem: $H_G(f)=\\text{Tr}(G_f)$, we establish a rigorous foundation for the G-entropy previously introduced by us, thereby identifying it not merely as a gradient-based regularizer, but also as a fundamental geometric invariant representing the total explainable statistical information captured by the probability distribution associated with the model. Furthermore, we establish a link between $G_f$ and the second-order derivative (i.e. the curvature) of the KL-divergence, leading to the notion of Covariate Cramér-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB). We demonstrate that $G_f$ is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, thereby providing fundamental limits of variance for semi-parametric estimators. Finally, we apply our geometric framework to the Manifold Hypothesis, lifting the latter from a heuristic assumption into a testable condition of rank-deficiency within the cFIM. By defining the Information Capture Ratio, we provide a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data.

Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness.

Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\\%) and diabetic (82.60\\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical."}

This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing."}

A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.\n  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).\n  Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit."}

Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios.

Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.\n  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed \"world\" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models."}

To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a \"Gold Standard\" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench.

Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations."}

As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps."}

Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access."}

To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties.

ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors.

If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards."}

Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC."}

To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

A recent attack on machine-learning models called membership inference lies at the crossroads of these two concerns. The attack is given as input a set of records and a trained model and seeks to identify which of those records may have been used to train the model. On one hand, this attack can be used to identify user data used to train a model, which may violate their privacy especially in sensitive applications such as models trained on medical data. On the other hand, this attack can be used by rights-holders as evidence that a company used their works without permission to train a model.\n  Remarkably, it appears that no work has studied the effect of membership inference attacks (MIA) on generative music. Given that the music industry is worth billions of dollars and artists would stand to gain from being able to determine if their works were being used without permission, we believe this is a pressing issue to study. As such, in this work we begin a preliminary study into whether MIAs are effective on generative music. We study the effect of several existing attacks on MuseGAN, a popular and influential generative music model. Similar to prior work on generative audio MIAs, our findings suggest that music data is fairly resilient to known membership inference techniques."}

LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction.

Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence."}

To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control. Extensive evaluations leveraging crowdsourced datasets show that CONTRA improves user throughput and reduces both THO and CHO switching costs, outperforming 3GPP-compliant and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines in dynamic and real-world scenarios."}

In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs.

To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment.

However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores.

We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets).

The new velocity inherits the regularity of stochastic interpolant transports while also being the minimizer of an objective with strictly lower variance than flow matching itself. The update to the velocity field can be interpreted as the sum of all joint cumulants of the stochastic interpolant and copies of the reward, and to first order is their covariance. The algorithms do not require any access to gradients of the reward or backpropagating through trajectories of the flow or diffusion.

Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules.

Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets."}

This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\\%) and diabetic (82.60\\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical."}

We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP"}

Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark."}

For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available."}

The {\\em spherical cluster model} (SC) approximates a finite point set $P\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ by a sphere $S(c,r)$ as follows. Taking $r$ as a fraction $η\\in(0,1)$ (hyper-parameter) of the std deviation of distances between the center $c$ and the data points, the cost of the SC model is the sum over all data points lying outside the sphere $S$ of their power distance with respect to $S$. The center $c$ of the SC model is the point minimizing this cost. Note that $η=0$ yields the celebrated center of mass used in KMeans clustering. We make three contributions.\n  First, we show fitting a spherical cluster yields a strictly convex but not smooth combinatorial optimization problem. Second, we present an exact solver using the Clarke gradient on a suitable stratified cell complex defined from an arrangement of hyper-spheres. Finally, we present experiments on a variety of datasets ranging in dimension from $d=9$ to $d=10,000$, with two main observations. First, the exact algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than BFGS based heuristics for datasets of small/intermediate dimension and small values of $η$, and for high dimensional datasets (say $d>100$) whatever the value of $η$. Second, the center of the SC model behave as a parameterized high-dimensional median.\n  The SC model is of direct interest for high dimensional multivariate data analysis, and the application to the design of mixtures of SC will be reported in a companion paper."}

An Adversarial Parametric Editing Framework for Hallucination Mitigation in VLMs", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \\textbf{A}ctivate-\\textbf{L}ocate-\\textbf{E}dit \\textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead."}
