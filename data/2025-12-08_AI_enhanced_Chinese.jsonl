This paper introduces a large-language-model (LLM)-driven conversational assistant that captures such knowledge on the shop floor and converts it incrementally and interactively into standards-compliant Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 diagrams. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate \"AS-IS\" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved \"TO-BE\" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments. The results demonstrate that conversational LLMs can potentially be used to lower the skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous-improvement efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u5c06\u8f66\u95f4\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aBPMN 2.0\u56fe\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u90e8\u7f72\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u6027\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u9700\u5de5\u5177\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u6d41\u7a0b\u6587\u6863\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Gemini 2.5 Pro\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Gradio\u524d\u7aef\u548cbpmn - js\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bbf\u8c08\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u83b7\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ec6\u8282\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7ef4\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a9\u624b\u7ea612\u5206\u949f\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u201cAS - IS\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u201cTO - BE\u201d\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14API\u6210\u672c\u7b26\u5408\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4e25\u683c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6587\u6863\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u52a9\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4fdd\u5b58\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u8425\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control.

This research specifically tested how well advanced LLMs like Microsoft Phi 2, Mistral 7B, and Zypher 7B can create practical, risk-aware strategies for investing mutual funds in different sectors of the economy. Our method is sophisticated: it combines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which enables the LLM to check external, real-time data with standard financial optimization methods. The model's advice is context-aware because we feed it large economic signals, like changes in the global economy. The Zypher 7B model was the clear winner. It consistently produced strategies that maximized investment returns while delivering better risk-adjusted results than the other models. Its ability to process complex relationships and contextual information makes it a highly powerful tool for financial allocation.

So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself.

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa.

Modern sequence aligners are widely used for this task, and many employ the seed-chain-extend heuristic with $k$-mer seeds. Previously, Shaw and Yu showed that optimal linear-gap cost chaining can produce a chain with $1 - O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right)$ recoverability, the proportion of the mutation history that is recovered, in $O\\left(mn^{2.43\u03b8} \\log n\\right)$ expected time, where $\u03b8< 0.206$ is the mutation rate under a substitution-only channel and $s_1$ is assumed to be uniformly random. However, a gap remains between theory and practice, since real genomic data includes insertions and deletions (indels), and yet seed-chain-extend remains effective. In this paper, we generalize those prior results by introducing mathematical machinery to deal with the two new obstacles introduced by indel channels: the dependence of neighboring anchors and the presence of anchors that are only partially correct. We are thus able\n  to prove that the expected recoverability of an optimal chain is $\\ge 1 - O\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\Bigr)$ and the expected runtime is $O(mn^{3.15 \\cdot \u03b8_T}\\log n)$, when the total mutation rate given by the sum of the substitution, insertion, and deletion mutation rates ($\u03b8_T = \u03b8_i + \u03b8_d + \u03b8_s$) is less than $0.159$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this problem, we seek a mechanism that (probabilistically) identifies the winner of a tournament after observing round-robin play among $n$ teams in a league. Such a mechanism should satisfy the natural properties of monotonicity and Condorcet consistency. Moreover, from the league's perspective, the winner-determination tournament rule should be strategyproof, meaning that no team can do better by losing a game on purpose.\n  Past work considered settings in which each team is fully selfish, caring only about its own probability of winning, and settings in which each team is fully selfless, caring only about the total winning probability of itself and the team to which it deliberately loses. More recently, researchers considered a mixture of these two settings with a parameter $\u03bb$. Intermediate selfishness $\u03bb$ means that a team will not lose on purpose unless its pair gains at least $\u03bbs$ winning probability, where $s$ is the individual team's sacrifice from its own winning probability. All of the dozens of previously known tournament rules require $\u03bb= \u03a9(n)$ to be strategyproof, and it has been an open problem to find such a rule with the smallest $\u03bb$.\n  In this work, we make significant progress by designing a tournament rule that is strategyproof with $\u03bb= 11$. Along the way, we propose a new notion of multiplicative pairwise non-manipulability that ensures that two teams cannot manipulate the outcome of a game to increase the sum of their winning probabilities by more than a multiplicative factor $\u03b4$ and provide a rule which is multiplicatively pairwise non-manipulable for $\u03b4= 3.5$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u6297\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa \u03bb = 11 \u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u4e58\u6027\u6210\u5bf9\u975e\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u5f80\u5df2\u77e5\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\u9700 \u03bb = \u03a9(n) \u624d\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f \u03bb \u7684\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e58\u6027\u6210\u5bf9\u975e\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa \u03bb = 11 \u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa \u03b4 = 3.5 \u65f6\u4e58\u6027\u6210\u5bf9\u975e\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5c0f \u03bb \u89c4\u5219\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide such explicit, closed-form error estimates for an FFT-based convolution method specialized to the Heston model.

Despite recent progress, like the visual autoregressive model that unifies text and image processing in a single transformer architecture, generating high-quality interleaved content remains challenging. Moreover, evaluations of these interleaved sequences largely remain underexplored, with existing benchmarks often limited by unimodal metrics that inadequately assess the intricacies of combined image-text outputs. To address these issues, we present RAG-IGBench, a thorough benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the task of Interleaved Generation based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-IG) in open-domain question answering. RAG-IG integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with retrieval mechanisms, enabling the models to access external image-text information for generating coherent multimodal content. Distinct from previous datasets, RAG-IGBench draws on the latest publicly available content from social platforms and introduces innovative evaluation metrics that measure the quality of text and images, as well as their consistency. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs (both open-source and proprietary) on RAG-IGBench, we provide an in-depth analysis examining the capabilities and limitations of these models. Additionally, we validate our evaluation metrics by demonstrating their high correlation with human assessments.

While rule-based methods rely on separation logic rules (lemmas) for automation, these rule statements are insufficient for describing automation strategies, which usually involve the alignment and elimination of corresponding memory layouts in specific scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Stellis, a strategy language for purifying separation logic entailments, i.e., removing all spatial formulas to reduce the entailment to a simpler pure entailment. Stellis features a powerful matching mechanism and a flexible action description, enabling the straightforward encoding of a wide range of strategies. To ensure strategy soundness, we introduce an algorithm that generates a soundness condition for each strategy, thereby reducing the soundness of each strategy to the correctness of its soundness condition. Furthermore, based on a mechanized reduction soundness theorem, our prototype implementation generates correctness proofs for the overall automation. We evaluate our system on a benchmark of 229 entailments collected from verification of standard linked data structures and the memory module of a microkernel, and the evaluation results demonstrate that, with such flexibility and convenience provided, our system is also highly effective, which automatically purifies 95.6% (219 out of 229) of the entailments using 5 libraries with 98 strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u8bed\u8a00Stellis\u51c0\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u8574\u542b\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u79bb\u903b\u8f91\u8574\u542b\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc1\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u8bed\u8a00Stellis\uff0c\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5408\u7406\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u5f52\u7ea6\u5408\u7406\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5728229\u4e2a\u8574\u542b\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285\u4e2a\u5e9398\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u51c0\u5316\u4e8695.6%\uff08219\u4e2a\uff09\u7684\u8574\u542b\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Stellis\u5177\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

These include computational constraints, the limitations of single-view learning algorithms and the complexity of processing large datasets from different domains, sources or views. In this context, multi-view clustering (MVC), a class of unsupervised multi-view learning, emerges as a powerful approach to overcome these challenges. MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training, co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions in MVC research. This study represents an extensive workload, encompassing the review of over 140 foundational and recent publications, the development of comparative insights on integration strategies such as early fusion, late fusion, and joint learning, and the structured investigation of practical use cases in the areas of healthcare, multimedia, and social network analysis.

The associated transfer operator $P: L^2(M,\u03bc) \\to L^2(M,\u03bc)$ encodes the propagation of semantic mass. Under mild regularity assumptions (compactness, ergodicity, bounded Jacobian), $P$ is compact with discrete spectrum. Within this setting, we prove the Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT): the leading eigenfunctions of $P$ induce finitely many spectral basins of invariant meaning, each definable in an o-minimal structure over $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide. This explains how discrete symbolic semantics can emerge from continuous computation: the continuous activation manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology.

Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022).\n  In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the \"order of reasoning\" and number of agents relevant to a query is $\u03c9(\\sqrt{n})$. These results demonstrate that modest extensions to the space of expert queries dramatically strengthen the power of robust forecast aggregation. We therefore expect that our new query framework will open up a fruitful line of research in this area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e3b\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e13\u5bb6\u5982\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u4f46\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9002\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5f00\u542f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u679c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u4ea4\u642d\u8f7d\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u516c\u4ea4\u642d\u8f7d\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u6709\u76ca\u4e14\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ad9\u70b9\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u7528\u6237\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u79fb\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5982\u516c\u4ea4\u6709\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u4ea4\u642d\u8f7d\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u6d77\u516c\u4ea4/\u51fa\u79df\u8f66/\u7535\u4fe1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u4ea4\u548c\u57fa\u7ad9\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u4ea4\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u516c\u4ea4\u8986\u76d6\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u70b9\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u516c\u4ea4\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8d2d\u4e70\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57ce\u5e02\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u516c\u4ea4\u642d\u8f7d\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u6709\u76ca\u4e14\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, existing research lack analysis of its actual contributions in complex temporal tasks. We design Non-Stateful (NS) models progressively removing membrane propagation to quantify its stage-wise role. Experiments reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: moderate removal in shallow or deep layers improves performance, while excessive removal causes collapse. We attribute this to spatio-temporal resource competition where neurons encode both semantics and dynamics within limited range, with temporal state consuming capacity for spatial learning. Based on this, we propose Spatial-Temporal Separable Network (STSep), decoupling residual blocks into independent spatial and temporal branches. The spatial branch focuses on semantic extraction while the temporal branch captures motion through explicit temporal differences. Experiments on Something-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51 show STSep achieves superior performance, with retrieval task and attention analysis confirming focus on motion rather than static appearance.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as automated assessors, showing promising alignment with human annotations. Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset.

A broad class of such tasks involves a semantic join-joining two tables based on a natural language predicate per pair of tuples, evaluated using an LLM. Semantic joins generalize tasks such as entity matching and record categorization, as well as more complex text understanding tasks. A naive implementation is expensive as it requires invoking an LLM for every pair of rows in the cross product. Existing approaches mitigate this cost by first applying embedding-based semantic similarity to filter candidate pairs, deferring to an LLM only when similarity scores are deemed inconclusive. However, these methods yield limited gains in practice, since semantic similarity may not reliably predict the join outcome. We propose Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ for short), a novel approach for performing semantic joins that significantly reduces cost while preserving quality. FDJ automatically extracts features and combines them into a logical expression in conjunctive normal form that we call a featurized decomposition to effectively prune out non-matching pairs. A featurized decomposition extracts key information from text records and performs inexpensive comparisons on the extracted features. We show how to use LLMs to automatically extract reliable features and compose them into logical expressions while providing statistical guarantees on the output result-an inherently challenging problem due to dependencies among features. Experiments on real-world datasets show up to 10 times reduction in cost compared with the state-of-the-art while providing the same quality guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFeaturized - Decomposition Join (FDJ)\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6210\u672c\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e10\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFDJ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u5408\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5254\u9664\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5bf9\uff1b\u5229\u7528LLMs\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ec4\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e10\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FDJ\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge.

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies.

Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs. We introduce one-step diffusion samplers which learn a step-conditioned ODE so that one large step reproduces the trajectory of many small ones via a state-space consistency loss. We further show that standard ELBO estimates in diffusion samplers degrade in the few-step regime because common discrete integrators yield mismatched forward/backward transition kernels. Motivated by this analysis, we derive a deterministic-flow (DF) importance weight for ELBO estimation without a backward kernel. To calibrate DF, we introduce a volume-consistency regularization that aligns the accumulated volume change along the flow across step resolutions.

State-space formulations provide a coherent probabilistic framework for such inference, yet fully Bayesian estimation is often computationally prohibitive because evaluating the observed-data likelihood requires integration over all latent trajectories. The Sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$) algorithm offers a principled approach for joint state and parameter inference, combining an outer SMC sampler over parameters with an inner particle filter that estimates the likelihood up to the current time point. Despite its theoretical appeal, this nested particle filter imposes substantial computational cost, limiting routine use in near-real-time outbreak response. We propose Ensemble SMC$^2$ (eSMC$^2$), a scalable variant that replaces the inner particle filter with an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to approximate the incremental likelihood at each observation time. While this substitution introduces bias via a Gaussian approximation, we mitigate finite-sample effects using an unbiased Gaussian density estimator and adapt the EnKF for epidemic data through state-dependent observation variance. This makes our approach particularly suitable for overdispersed incidence data commonly encountered in infectious disease surveillance. Simulation experiments with known ground truth and an application to 2022 United States (U.S.) monkeypox incidence data demonstrate that eSMC$^2$ achieves substantial computational gains while producing posterior estimates comparable to SMC$^2$.

Code: https://github.com/zihaowu25/InvarDiff", "summary": "Diffusion models deliver high-fidelity synthesis but remain slow due to iterative sampling. We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results.

We introduce Wasserstein Evolution (WE), a principled optimization framework that implements the Wasserstein gradient flow of a free energy functional, mathematically bridging evolutionary dynamics with thermodynamics. WE directly translates the physical competition between potential gradient forces (exploitation) and entropic forces (exploration) into algorithmic dynamics, providing an adaptive, theoretically grounded mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. Experiments on challenging benchmark functions demonstrate that WE achieves competitive convergence performance while maintaining dramatically higher population diversity than classical methods (GA, DE, CMA-ES).This superior entropy preservation enables effective navigation of multi-modal landscapes without premature convergence, validating the physical interpretation of optimization as a disorder-to-order transition.

This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains.

With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, a subclass of the temporal graph, i.e., Property Evolution Temporal Graph, in which the value of properties on nodes or edges changes frequently while the graph's topology barely changes, is growing rapidly. However, existing temporal graph management solutions are not oriented to the Property Evolution Temporal Graph data, which leads to highly complex data modeling and low-performance query processing of temporal graph queries. To solve these problems, we developed PETGraph, a data management system for Property Evolution Temporal Graph data. PETGraph adopts a valid-time temporal property graph data model to facilitate data modeling, supporting ACID features with transactions. To improve temporal graph query performance, we designed a space-efficient temporal property storage and a fine-granularity multi-level locking mechanism. Experimental results show that PETGraph requires, on average, only 33% of the storage space needed by the current best data management solution.

This paper offers a novel framework by conceptualizing the globalized economy as a \"Congestible Club Good,\" leading to a \"Fractured Metropolis.\" We argue that globalization flows ($M$) are constrained by domestic Institutional Capacity ($K$), which is heterogeneous and historically contingent. We introduce the concept of the \"Optimization Cutoff\": globalization incentivized the US to bypass costly domestic upgrades in favor of global expansion, leading to the long-term neglect of Public Capacity ($K_{Public}$). This historical path created a deep polarization. \"Congested Incumbents,\" reliant on the stagnant $K_{Public}$, experience globalization as chaos ($MC>MB$), while \"Insulated Elites\" use Private Capacity ($K_{Private}$) to bypass bottlenecks ($MB>MC$). This divergence paralyzes the consensus needed to restore $K_{Public}$, creating a \"Capacity Trap\" where protectionism becomes the politically rational, yet economically suboptimal, equilibrium.

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5728MIMIC - IV\u4e0a\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u4e00\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\uff1b\u4ef7\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u8fdc\u8d85\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\uff1b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u501f\u52a9\u51bb\u7ed3\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u5f02\u3002"}}

The von Mises-Fisher (or Langevin) distribution has played a central role in directional statistics. Directional data have been investigated for many decades, and more recently, they have gained increasing attention in diverse areas such as bioinformatics and text data analysis. Although outliers can significantly affect the estimation results even for directional data, the treatment of outliers remains an unresolved and challenging problem. In the frequentist framework, numerous studies have developed robust estimation methods for directional data with outliers, but, in contrast, only a few robust estimation methods have been proposed in the Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference based on density power-divergence and $\u03b3$-divergence and establish their asymptotic properties and robustness. In addition, the Bayesian approach naturally provides a way to assess estimation uncertainty through the posterior distribution, which is particularly useful for small samples. Furthermore, to carry out the posterior computation, we develop the posterior computation algorithm based on the weighted Bayesian bootstrap for estimating parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulation studies. Using two real datasets, we further show that the proposed method provides reliable and robust estimation even in the presence of outliers or data contamination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5bf9von Mises - Fisher\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5e42\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u03b3\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b9\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5904\u7406\u662f\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5e42\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u03b3\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5bf9von Mises - Fisher\u5206\u5e03\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u3002"}}

We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines. MCP-AI provides a scalable basis for interpretable, composable, and safety-oriented AI within upcoming clinical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7ed3\u5408MCP\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684MCP - AI\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u7eb5\u5411\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684AI\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u957f\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u6108\u53d1\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMCP\u7684MCP - AI\u67b6\u6784\uff0cMCP\u6587\u4ef6\u6355\u6349\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMCP - AI\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u8d23\u4efb\u5728\u533b\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u76d1\u7ba1\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "MCP - AI\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7684AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

It has found applications across various fields, including network centrality, graph clustering, and machine learning. These applications typically require efficient evaluation of pairwise biharmonic distances. However, existing algorithms remain computationally expensive. The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L >= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains.

NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns.\n  By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives.

We address this by deriving gradient computation through spike event queues, including delays, and implementing memory-efficient, gradient-enabled event queue structures. These are benchmarked across CPU, GPU, TPU, and LPU platforms. We find that queue design strongly shapes performance. CPUs, as expected, perform well with traditional tree-based or FIFO implementations, while GPUs excel with ring buffers for smaller simulations, yet under higher memory pressure prefer more sparse data-structures.

Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation.

As a result, genomic data vastly outpace available phenotypic labels, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised models. We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants.

Though appealing for financial and logistical reasons, using standard tools for inference can misrepresent the association between independent variables and the outcome of interest when the true, unobserved outcome is replaced by a predicted value. In this paper, we characterize the statistical challenges inherent to drawing inference with predicted data (IPD) and show that high predictive accuracy does not guarantee valid downstream inference. We show that all such failures reduce to statistical notions of (i) bias, when predictions systematically shift the estimand or distort relationships among variables, and (ii) variance, when uncertainty from the prediction model and the intrinsic variability of the true data are ignored. We then review recent methods for conducting IPD and discuss how this framework is deeply rooted in classical statistical theory. We then comment on some open questions and interesting avenues for future work in this area, and end with some comments on how to use predicted data in scientific studies that is both transparent and statistically principled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740AI\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u66ff\u4ee3\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\u3001\u56de\u987e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6709\u65b0\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7edf\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8fd1\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for two high-dimensional inverse problems governed by PDE examples, namely for the estimation of a distributed Robin boundary coefficient in a linear diffusion problem, and for a coefficient estimation problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff08BAE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "BAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u964d\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6b63\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u573a\u7684\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u6216\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5747\u503c\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\uff08\u5316\uff09PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cf0\u52d2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u5747\u503c\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eBAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents' preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities. We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edfPoA\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u6570\u503c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u53d8\u6362\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8PoA\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u53d8PoA\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u8868\u660e\u9700\u660e\u786e\u516c\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPoA\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u6570\u503c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u53d8\u6362\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8PoA\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u52a9\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8PoA\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u5141\u8bb8\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u540c\u6536\u8d39\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u516c\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

LLMs require few, if any, training examples and can be utilized by users without expertise in model development. However, this comes at the cost of substantially higher resource and energy consumption compared to smaller models, which often achieve similar predictive performance for simple tasks. In this paper, we present our vision for just-in-time model replacement (JITR), where, upon identifying a recurring task in calls to an LLM, the model is replaced transparently with a cheaper alternative that performs well for this specific task. JITR retains the ease of use and low development effort of LLMs, while saving significant cost and energy.

We report a two-phase qualitative study with 20 software engineers to understand this. In Phase I, participants exchanged peer reviews and were interviewed about their affective responses and engagement decisions. In Phase II, we introduced a new prompt matching engineers' preferences and probed how characteristics shaped their reactions. We develop an integrative account linking emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution. We identify self-regulation strategies that engineers use to regulate their emotions in response to negative feedback: reframing, dialogic regulation, avoidance, and defensiveness. Engagement proceeds through social calibration; engineers align their responses and behaviors to the relational climate and team norms. Trajectories to resolution, in the case of peer-led review, vary by locus (solo/dyad/team) and an internal sense-making process. With the LLM-assisted review, emotional costs and the need for self-regulation seem lower. When LLM feedback aligned with engineers' cognitive expectations, participants reported reduced processing effort and a potentially higher tendency to adopt. We show that LLM-assisted review redirects engagement from emotion management to cognitive load management. We contribute an integrative model of engagement that links emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution, showing how affective and cognitive processes influence feedback adoption in peer-led and LLM-assisted code reviews.

Accepted to Bayesian Analysis", "summary": "Optimal experimental design is a classic topic in statistics, with many well-studied problems, applications, and solutions. The design problem we study is the placement of sensors to monitor spatiotemporal processes, explicitly accounting for the temporal dimension in our modeling and optimization. We observe that recent advancements in computational sciences often yield large datasets based on physics-based simulations, which are rarely leveraged in experimental design. We introduce a novel model-based sensor placement criterion, along with a highly-efficient optimization algorithm, which integrates physics-based simulations and Bayesian experimental design principles to identify sensor networks that \"minimize information loss\" from simulated data. Our technique relies on sparse variational inference and (separable) Gauss-Markov priors, and thus may adapt many techniques from Bayesian experimental design.

Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less.

We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories.

Just as data validation and access controls shifted from the application to the DBMS, freeing application developers from these concerns, we argue that systems should support Data Flow Controls (DFCs) and enforce DFC policies natively. This paper describes early work developing a portable instance of DFC for DBMSes and outlines a broader research agenda toward DFC for agent ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e94\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\uff08DFC\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e3aDBMS\u5f00\u53d1DFC\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u652f\u6301DFC\u5e76\u539f\u751f\u6267\u884cDFC\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u4e3aDBMS\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u79fb\u690dDFC\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u4e3aDBMS\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u79fb\u690dDFC\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u652f\u6301DFC\u5e76\u539f\u751f\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684DFC\u7814\u7a76\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002"}}

It also involves elements such as food availability and affordability, as well as people being able to access food that can be consumed healthily. Natural disasters, however, can seriously threaten food security. Disasters' effects on food security are especially more evident in countries such as Turkiye that are frequently exposed to natural disasters due to their geologic and geographical structure. For this reason, the study investigates the effects of natural disasters on food security in Turkiye. The research first creates the Food Security Index in order to estimate the effects of natural disasters on food security. The next phase follows the process of econometric analysis, which consists of three steps. Step one of the econometric analysis uses unit root tests to check the stationarity levels of the series. The second step uses the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test to examine the long-term relationship between natural disasters and food security. The third and final step estimates the effects of natural disasters on food security. According to the obtained results, the study shows earthquakes, storms, and floods to have a significant short- as well as long-term negative effect on food security.

We report on the industrial deployment of WhatsCode, a domain-specific AI development system that supports WhatsApp (serving over 2 billion users) and processes millions of lines of code across multiple platforms. Over 25 months (2023-2025), WhatsCode evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with end-to-end feature development and DevOps processes.\n  WhatsCode achieved substantial quantifiable impact, improving automated privacy verification coverage 3.5x from 15% to 53%, identifying privacy requirements, and generating over 3,000 accepted code changes with acceptance rates ranging from 9% to 100% across different automation domains. The system committed 692 automated refactor/fix changes, 711 framework adoptions, 141 feature development assists and maintained 86% precision in bug triage. Our study identifies two stable human-AI collaboration patterns that emerged from production deployment: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60% of cases) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%). We demonstrate that organizational factors, such as ownership models, adoption dynamics, and risk management, are as decisive as technical capabilities for enterprise-scale AI success.

To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of \"self-control\" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as \"scheming\" or deliberate misalignment.

However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMetronome\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728OpenLambda\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u7528\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMetronome\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51fd\u6570\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "Metronome\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e64.88%-95.83%\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\u4e14\u786e\u4fddSLA\u5408\u89c4\u3002", "conclusion": "Metronome\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To allow a quantitative methodology which traces back in time to the planet birth locations, we train recently developed conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on synthetic data from a global planet formation model which tracks growth from dust grains to evolved final giant planets. In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data.

In our model, the government raises revenue using distortionary income and commodity taxes. If more or less productive people have identical tastes for externality-generating consumption, the government optimally imposes a Pigouvian tax equal to the marginal damage from the externality. This is true regardless of whether the tax is regressive. But, if regressivity reflects different preferences of people with different incomes rather than solely income effects, the optimal tax differs from the Pigouvian benchmark. We derive sufficient statistics for optimal policy, and use them to study carbon taxation in the United States. Our empirical results suggest an optimal carbon tax that is remarkably close to the Pigouvian level, but with higher carbon taxes for very high-income households if this is feasible.

Similar to the propagation-aggregation methodology, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm tests isomorphism through color refinement according to color representations of a node and its neighbor nodes. However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models.

While reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods traditionally rely on global kernel regressors, it is also common to use a smoothness-based approach that exploits local approximations. We show that these perspectives are deeply connected through the spectral properties of isotropic kernels. In particular, we characterize the Fourier spectra of the Mat\u00e9rn, square-exponential, rational-quadratic, $\u03b3$-exponential, piecewise-polynomial, and Dirichlet kernels, and show that the decay rate determines asymptotic regret from both viewpoints. For kernelized bandit algorithms, spectral decay yields upper bounds on the maximum information gain, governing worst-case regret, while for smoothness-based methods, the same decay rates establish H\u00f6lder space embeddings and Besov space norm-equivalences, enabling local continuity analysis. These connections show that kernel-based and locally adaptive algorithms can be analyzed within a unified framework.

However, they suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and are susceptible to misleading interpretations in complex scenarios. Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of \"Understand -> Rethink -> Correct\", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios. It provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence.

To investigate the impact of AI across a large organisation, we assessed AI exposure at the task level within roles at the UK Civil Service (UKCS). Using a novel dataset of UKCS job adverts, covering 193,497 vacancies over 6 years, our large language model (LLM)-driven analysis estimated AI exposure scores of 1,542,411 tasks. By aggregating AI exposure scores for tasks within each role, we calculated the mean and variance of job-level exposure to AI, highlighting the heterogeneous impacts of AI, even for seemingly identical jobs. We then use an LLM to redesign jobs, focusing on task automation, task optimisation, and task reallocation. We find that the redesign process leads to tasks where humans have comparative advantage over AI, including strategic leadership, complex problem resolution, and stakeholder management. Overall, automation and augmentation are expected to have nuanced effects across all levels of the organisational hierarchy. Most economic value of AI is expected to arise from productivity gains rather than role displacement.

These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u7ecf\u5178\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u4fee\u6b63\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDE\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd1\u671f\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u867d\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u786c\u4ef6\u74f6\u9888\u4f7f\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u4e30\u5bcc\u91cf\u5b50\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u4fee\u6b63\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u4e0a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fdc\u8d85\u7ecf\u5178\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5916\u63a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u6316\u6398\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ef7\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods.

In this work, we propose the Executor-Analyst Framework, a modular architecture that decouples the syntactic precision of tool execution from the semantic robustness of clinical reasoning. By orchestrating specialized TxAgents (Executors) with long-context foundation models (Analysts), we mitigate the reasoning deficits observed in monolithic models. Beyond simple modularity, we demonstrate that a Stratified Ensemble strategy significantly outperforms global pooling by preserving evidentiary diversity, effectively addressing the information bottleneck. Furthermore, our stress tests reveal critical scaling insights: (1) a \\textit{Context-Performance Paradox}, where extending reasoning contexts beyond 12k tokens introduces noise that degrades accuracy; and (2) the \\textit{Curse of Dimensionality} in action spaces, where expanding toolsets necessitates hierarchical retrieval strategies.

Traditional metrics focusing on Healthspan (years free of disease) overlook the gradual erosion of physiological capacity that occurs even in the absence of illness, leading to declines in productivity and eventual lack of capacity to work. To address this critical gap, we introduce Peakspan: the age interval during which an individual maintains at least 90% of their peak functional performance in a specific physiological or cognitive domain. Our multi-system analysis reveals a profound misalignment: most biological systems reach maximal capacity in early adulthood, resulting in a Peakspan that is remarkably short relative to the total lifespan. This dissociation means humans now spend the majority of their adult lives in a \"healthy but declined\" state, characterized by a significant functional gap. We argue that extending Peakspan and developing strategies to restore function in post-peak individuals is the functional manifestation of rejuvenative biomedical progress and is essential for sustained economic growth in aging societies.

While mainframes are generally dependable, they can be difficult to maintain due to their high maintenance costs, the shortage of skills, and the problems in integrating them with cloud-based systems. By adopting AI-driven modernization strategies such as automated code refactoring, migration of data using smart tools, and predictive maintenance, companies can easily move to microservices, containerized environments, and hybrid cloud platforms. Machine learning models have the capability to go through legacy codebases, figure out efficiency opportunities, and carry out automated testing and deployment. Besides that, AI improves the organization's operational efficiency by generating the insights that can be used to level the workload and detect the anomalies. The coupling of the two is not only about saving the core business logic but also about enabling quicker innovation, less downtime, and enhanced system resilience.

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165OntoAxiom\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u672c\u4f53\u516c\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9010\u516c\u7406\u63d0\u793aF1\u5206\u6570\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u516c\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u867d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f46\u53ef\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5019\u9009\u516c\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u672c\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u8bc6\u522b\u672c\u4f53\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u516c\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OntoAxiom\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u542b\u4e5d\u4e2a\u672c\u4f53\u300117118\u4e2a\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u548c2771\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u591a\u79cd\u516c\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6d4b\u8bd512\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u9010\u516c\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793aF1\u5206\u6570\u9ad8\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u516c\u7406\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u9886\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u516c\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4e3a\u672c\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u672c\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u3002"}}

However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e74\u5ea6\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u5408\u6210\u516c\u5171\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6570\u636e\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u91cf\u590d\u5236\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u903c\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u533f\u540d\u6570\u636e\u518d\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u4fdd\u5bc6\u627f\u8bfa\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4f01\u4e1a\u516c\u5f00\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u516c\u5171\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5404\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a2007\u5e74\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3b\u8c03\u67e5\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u516c\u5171\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u91cf\u590d\u5236\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u4e14\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u4e2a\u4eba\u6216\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba8\u8bba\u5e74\u5ea6\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u3002"}}

While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits. Two violation-output coverage metrics identify the highest number and diversity of unsafe outputs, enabling interpretable comparisons across architectures and training strategies. Significance: Violation-focused fuzzing reframes safety assessment as an empirical, reproducible process. By transforming safety from a training heuristic into a measurable property of the deployed model, it establishes a foundation for evidence-based benchmarking, regulatory readiness, and ethical assurance in next-generation neural interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u8986\u76d6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68c0\u6d4bML\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u523a\u6fc0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u523a\u6fc0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u548c\u76ae\u8d28\u523a\u6fc0\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6709\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "ML\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5047\u4f53\u8bbe\u5907\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u523a\u6fc0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u523a\u6fc0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u523a\u6fc0\u662f\u5426\u8fdd\u53cd\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u8986\u76d6\u6307\u6807\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u8d85\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fdd\u89c4\u8f93\u51fa\u8986\u76d6\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u591a\u548c\u6700\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u8fdd\u89c4\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u4fdd\u969c\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated.

Recent advances in Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for solving (W)PMS have mainly focused on designing clause weighting schemes. However, existing methods often fail to adequately distinguish between PMS and WPMS, typically employing uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking critical structural differences between the two problem types. In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types. Furthermore, we propose a decimation method that prioritizes satisfying unit and hard clauses, effectively complementing our proposed clause weighting scheme. Building on these methods, we develop a new SLS solver for (W)PMS named DeepDist. Experimental results on benchmarks from the anytime tracks of recent MaxSAT Evaluations show that DeepDist outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers. Notably, a hybrid solver combining DeepDist with TT-Open-WBO-Inc surpasses the performance of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2024 winners, SPB-MaxSAT-c-Band and SPB-MaxSAT-c-FPS, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets. Theoretically, we derive a global, non-asymptotic convergence bound under state perturbations, showing stability through the perturbation-error term and efficiency through the convergence-error term.

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86AI\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578bFCNv2\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u5230\u4e2d\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u98d3\u98ce\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u98ce\u66b4\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6027\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u98d3\u98ce\u7b49\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u5bf9\u98d3\u98ce\u4f5b\u7f57\u4f26\u8428\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u7ea7\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u542f\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5176\u5bf9\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "FCNv2\u5728\u4f4e\u5230\u4e2d\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u98d3\u98ce\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u4e00\u822c\u98ce\u66b4\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f46\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5404\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5747\u4f4e\u4f30\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6027\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ecf\u51e0\u6b65\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u540e\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u8d2f\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AI\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Unlike existing models that rely solely on a series of snapshots of the limit order book, KANFormer integrates the actions of agents related to LOB dynamics and the position of the order in the queue to more effectively capture patterns related to execution likelihood. We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders. The results show that KANFormer outperforms existing works in both calibration (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination (C-index, time-dependent AUC).

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u7b97\u5b50(CFO)\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u53d8 PDE \u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u56db\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8 PDE \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8981\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60 PDE \u53f3\u4fa7\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u6837\u6761\uff0c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u6784\u9020\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCFO \u957f\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u597d\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff1b\u7528 25% \u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u8d85\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u591a\u964d 87%\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u53ea\u9700 50%\uff0c\u53ef\u9006\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "CFO \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u53d8 PDE \u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators.

The emerging challenge is no longer model fine-tuning but context engineering-how systems capture, structure, and govern external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input to enable trustworthy reasoning. Existing practices such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration remain fragmented, producing transient artefacts that limit traceability and accountability. This paper proposes a file-system abstraction for context engineering, inspired by the Unix notion that 'everything is a file'. The abstraction offers a persistent, governed infrastructure for managing heterogeneous context artefacts through uniform mounting, metadata, and access control. Implemented within the open-source AIGNE framework, the architecture realises a verifiable context-engineering pipeline, comprising the Context Constructor, Loader, and Evaluator, that assembles, delivers, and validates context under token constraints. As GenAI becomes an active collaborator in decision support, humans play a central role as curators, verifiers, and co-reasoners. The proposed architecture establishes a reusable foundation for accountable and human-centred AI co-work, demonstrated through two exemplars: an agent with memory and an MCP-based GitHub assistant.

While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

LLMs are then invoked to complete and fix unimplemented methods. We assessed iEcoreGen on twenty code-generation tasks across five LLMs. It surpasses LLM-only baselines on pass@k and performs on par with them on compilation@k.

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map.

We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory).

As these systems grow, extensive resources are required to develop and maintain simulation models of hardware and software components, as well as physical environments. Meanwhile, recent advances in generative AI have led to tools that can produce executable test cases for software systems, offering potential benefits such as reducing manual efforts or increasing test coverage. However, the application of generative AI techniques to simulation-based testing of large-scale cyber-physical systems remains underexplored. To better understand this gap, this study captures practitioners' perspectives on leveraging generative AI, based on a cross-company workshop with six organizations. Our contribution is twofold: (1) detailed, experience-based insights into challenges faced by engineers, and (2) a research agenda comprising three high-priority directions: (a) AI-generated scenarios and environment models, (b) simulators and AI in CI/CD pipelines, and (c) trustworthiness in generative AI for simulation.

Existing semantic alignment methods typically rely on additional digital processing at the transmitter or receiver, increasing overall device complexity. In this work, we introduce the first over-the-air semantic alignment framework based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), which enables latent-space alignment directly in the wave domain, reducing substantially the computational burden at the device level. We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u53e0\u667a\u80fd\u8d85\u8868\u9762\uff08SIM\uff09\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6ce2\u57df\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6536\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u52a0\u8bbe\u5907\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SIM\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9700\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSIM\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5747\u8861\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u65f6\u4e5f\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eSIM\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

Although prior work notes behavioral and other non-technical factors in AI integration, most studies still emphasize technical concerns and offer limited insight into how teams adapt to and trust AI. This paper proposes a Behavioral Software Engineering (BSE)-informed, human-centric framework to support SE organizations during early AI adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, we built and refined the framework through a literature review of organizational change models and thematic analysis of interview data, producing concrete, actionable steps. The framework comprises nine dimensions: AI Strategy Design, AI Strategy Evaluation, Collaboration, Communication, Governance and Ethics, Leadership, Organizational Culture, Organizational Dynamics, and Up-skilling, each supported by design principles and actions. To gather preliminary practitioner input, we conducted a survey (N=105) and two expert workshops (N=4). Survey results show that Up-skilling (15.2%) and AI Strategy Design (15.1%) received the highest $100-method allocations, underscoring their perceived importance in early AI initiatives. Findings indicate that organizations currently prioritize procedural elements such as strategy design, while human-centered guardrails remain less developed. Workshop feedback reinforced these patterns and emphasized the need to ground the framework in real-world practice.

Most assumptions are operationalized by introducing states of the world, conditional on which the decision situation can be analyzed without any remaining uncertainty. Conversely, most classical decision-theoretic approaches are not applicable if the states of the world are inaccessible. We propose a decision model that retains the appeal and simplicity of the original theory, but completely overcomes the need to specify the states of the world explicitly. The main idea of our approach is to address decision problems in a radically empirical way: instead of specifying states and consequences prior to the decision analysis, we only assume a protocol of observed act--consequence pairs as model primitives. We show how optimality in such empirical decision problems can be addressed by using protocol-based empirical choice functions and discuss three approaches for deriving inferential guarantees: (I) consistent statistical estimation of choice sets, (II) consistent statistical testing of choice functions with robustness guarantees, and (III) direct inference for empirical choice functions using credal sets.

However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts.

Yet, as external threats such as software supply chain attacks on project health and quality assurance increase, mechanisms for assigning and enforcing responsibility have become increasingly critical. In 2017, GitHub introduced the CODEOWNERS feature, which automatically designates reviewers for specific files to strengthen accountability and protect critical parts of the codebase. Despite its potential, little is known about how CODEOWNERS is actually adopted and practiced. We present the first large-scale empirical study of CODEOWNERS usage across over 844,000 pull requests with 1.9 million comments and over 2 million reviews. We identify 10,287 code owners to track their review activities. Results indicate that codeowners tend to adhere the rules specified in the CODEOWNERS file, exhibit similar collaborative behaviours to traditional metrics of ownership, but tend to contribute to a smoother and faster PR workflow over time. Finally, using regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, we find that repositories adopting CODEOWNERS experience shifts in review dynamics, as ownership redistributes review responsibilities away from core developers. Our results position CODEOWNERS as a promising yet underutilized mechanism for improving software governance and resilience. We discuss how projects can leverage this alternative ownership method as a perspective to enhance security, accountability, and workflow efficiency in open-source development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u8d8584.4\u4e07\u4e2a\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684CODEOWNERS\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u662f\u6539\u5584\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5916\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d23\u4efb\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800cCODEOWNERS\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u60c5\u51b5\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8d8584.4\u4e07\u4e2a\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001190\u4e07\u6761\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u8d85200\u4e07\u6b21\u5ba1\u67e5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b10287\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5176\u5ba1\u67e5\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08RDD\uff09\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u503e\u5411\u9075\u5b88\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7fPR\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u66f4\u987a\u7545\u5feb\u901f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528CODEOWNERS\u7684\u4ed3\u5e93\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8d23\u4efb\u4ece\u6838\u5fc3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "CODEOWNERS\u662f\u6539\u5584\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u53ef\u501f\u6b64\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6307\u6807\u672a\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSAGA\u6784\u5efa\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668RG - SAGA\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb\u6761\u4ef6\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002"}}

Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results.

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks.

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy.

This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5Germinator\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLIR\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f17\u591a\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u9ad8\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u65b9\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u548c\u65b9\u8a00\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4ece\u65b9\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u79cd\u5b50\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177Germinator\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2aMLIR\u9879\u76ee91\u4e2a\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad810 - 120%\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b088\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0840\u4e2a\u5df2\u786e\u8ba4\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Germinator\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5730\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d44\u6e90\u5c11\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u3002"}}

To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel unlearning framework tailored for LLM-based hardware code generation. Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities.

This overhead stems primarily from pervasive instrumentation of memory accesses - a significant fraction of which is redundant. We addresses this inefficiency through a static, compiler-integrated approach that identifies and eliminates redundant instrumentation, drastically reducing the runtime cost of dynamic data race detectors. We introduce a suite of interprocedural static analyses reasoning about memory access patterns, synchronization, and thread creation to eliminate instrumentation for provably race-free accesses and show that the completeness properties of the data race detector are preserved. We further observe that many inserted checks flag a race if and only if a preceding check has already flagged an equivalent race for the same memory location - albeit potentially at a different access. We characterize this notion of equivalence and show that, when limiting reporting to at least one representative for each equivalence class, a further class of redundant checks can be eliminated. We identify such accesses using a novel dominance-based elimination analysis. Based on these two insights, we have implemented five static analyses within the LLVM, integrated with the instrumentation pass of the race detector ThreadSanitizer. Our experimental evaluation on a diverse suite of real-world applications demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces race detection overhead, achieving a geomean speedup of 1.34x, with peak speedups reaching 2.5x under high thread contention. This performance is achieved with a negligible increase in compilation time and, being fully automatic, places no additional burden on developers.

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u7edf\u8ba1\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCorrDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u533a\u57df\u3001\u8003\u8651\u9ad8\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u5168\u5c40\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5bf9CMA - GFS\u548cSFF\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8eCMA - MESO\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eCorrDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u533a\u57df\u3001\u8003\u8651\u9ad8\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\u5168\u5c40\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5bf9CMA - GFS\u548cSFF\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u62a5\u5728MAE\u4e0a\u603b\u4f53\u4f18\u4e8eCMA - MESO\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u96f7\u8fbe\u7ec4\u5408\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u3002"}}

Our analysis reveals that the commonly used benchmarks do not reflect the true challenge of generalizing to novel targets.

These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached. Finally, Pareto-guided Evolutionary Selection effectively promotes architectures that jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, latency, confidence, and structural diversity. Across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet16-120, COCO-5K, and Cityscape, RevoNAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable.

Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy.

With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training.

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively.

We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters.

Various complex factors lead to intricate low-altitude turbulence outcomes. Under current observational conditions, especially when using only wind profile radar data, traditional methods struggle to accurately predict turbulence states. Therefore, this paper introduces a NeuTucker decomposition model utilizing discretized data. Designed for continuous yet sparse three-dimensional wind field data, it constructs a low-rank Tucker decomposition model based on a Tucker neural network to capture the latent interactions within the three-dimensional wind field data. Therefore, two core ideas are proposed here: 1) Discretizing continuous input data to adapt to models like NeuTucF that require discrete data inputs. 2) Constructing a four-dimensional Tucker interaction tensor to represent all possible spatio-temporal interactions among different elevations and three-dimensional wind speeds. In estimating missing observations in real datasets, this discretized NeuTucF model demonstrates superior performance compared to various common regression models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165NeuTucker\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6e4d\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u7a00\u758f\u4e09\u7ef4\u98ce\u573a\u6570\u636e\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c1\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u98ce\u5ed3\u7ebf\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6e4d\u6d41\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165NeuTucker\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u7ef4Tucker\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f20\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684NeuTucF\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuTucker\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u7a00\u758f\u4e09\u7ef4\u98ce\u573a\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6e4d\u6d41\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing LLM-based RL methods often focus on the guidance of control policy and encounter the challenge of limited representations of the backbone networks. To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods.

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift.

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode many concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into interpretable features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape. We provide the first theoretical explanations for some empirically observed phenomena, including feature absorption, dead neurons, and the neuron resampling technique.

Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths.

This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data.

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions. We integrate ERC into both DAPO and GPPO reinforcement learning algorithms.

Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation.

Code available at: https://github.com/charliezchen/scaling-matrix-preconditioning", "summary": "Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $\u03bc$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $\u03bc$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u540eMuon\u548cShampoo\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3Llama\u67b6\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6bd4AdamW\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e9\u9635\u7ea7\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u590d\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Shampoo\u3001SOAP\u3001Muon\uff09\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5206\u5757\u548c\u5ac1\u63a5\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6309\u03bcP\u7f29\u653e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u5757\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u63091/width\u7f29\u653e\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u540e\uff0cMuon\u548cShampoo\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5b9a\u89c4\u6a21Llama\u67b6\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6bd4AdamW\u67091.4\u00d7\u548c1.3\u00d7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8c03\u4f18\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD.

While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks.

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU).

This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens.

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($\u03b1$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-\u03b1}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|\u03bc_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$. The theory predicts that broader or more heterogeneous gate spectra produce slower decay of $f(\\ell)$ and hence larger learnability windows, whereas heavier-tailed noise compresses $\\mathcal{H}_N$ by slowing statistical concentration. By linking gate-induced time-scale structure, gradient noise, and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the fundamental quantities that govern when -- and for how long -- gated recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5171\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u914d\u7f6e - \u52a8\u529b\u5b66 - \u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3b\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u76f8\u540c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines.

Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers.

This work introduces a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predicting vapor pressure, enabling virtual screening and discovery of new space-suitable liquid lubricants. The ML models are trained with data from both high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations and experimental databases.

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings.

Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer.

To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed.

This paper presents a rigorous approach to the general design of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems.

Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution. By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression.

Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u5377\u79ef\u5757\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u5377\u79ef\u5757\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5806\u53e0\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u5757\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ea62000\u5f20\u89c2\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fd199%\uff0cAUC>0.99\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u53ef\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8599%\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002"}}

With rapid demographic shifts and growing labour market pressures, AI has become a strategic development priority, making the demand for relevant skills more urgent. This study investigates how universities and industries engage in shaping AI education and workforce preparation, drawing on survey responses from five African countries (Ghana, Namibia, Rwanda, Kenya and Zambia). The findings show broad recognition of AI importance but limited evidence of consistent engagement, practical training, or equitable access to resources. Most respondents who rated the AI component of their curriculum as very relevant reported being well prepared for jobs, but financial barriers, poor infrastructure, and weak communication limit participation, especially among students and underrepresented groups.

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

In addition, human feedback-based alignment remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPELC\u539f\u7406\u4e0eDecFormer\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0cPELC\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u989c\u8272\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u50cf\u7d20\u7b49\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u5408\u6210\uff08PELC\uff09\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DecFormer\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLUX.1\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u8fd8\u539f\u5168\u5c40\u989c\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a53%\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PELC\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7b49\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cDecFormer\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u6f5c\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

In response, recent work proposed a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) defense using data augmentation to achieve a \\enquote{deep} safety alignment, allowing the model to generate natural language refusals immediately following harmful prefills. Unfortunately, we show in this work that the \"deep\" safety alignment produced by such an approach is in fact not very deep. A generalization of the prefilling attack, which we refer to as the Rank-Assisted Prefilling (RAP) attack, can effectively extract harmful content from models fine-tuned with the data augmentation defense by selecting low-probability \"harmful\" tokens from the top 20 predicted next tokens at each step (thus ignoring high-probability \"refusal\" tokens). We argue that this vulnerability is enabled due to the \"gaming\" of the SFT objective when the target distribution entropies are low, where low fine-tuning loss is achieved by shifting large probability mass to a small number of refusal tokens while neglecting the high ranks of harmful tokens. We then propose a new perspective on achieving deep safety alignment by matching the token ranks of the target distribution, rather than their probabilities. This perspective yields a surprisingly simple fix to the data augmentation defense based on regularizing the attention placed on harmful prefill tokens, an approach we call PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO).

Recently, VNE with Alternative topologies (VNEAP) was introduced to capture malleable VNRs, where each request can be instantiated using one of several functionally equivalent topologies that trade resources differently. While this flexibility enlarges the feasible space, it also introduces an additional decision layer, making dynamic embedding more challenging. This paper proposes HRL-VNEAP, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for VNEAP under dynamic arrivals. A high-level policy selects the most suitable alternative topology (or rejects the request), and a low-level policy embeds the chosen topology onto the substrate network. Experiments on realistic substrate topologies under multiple traffic loads show that naive exploitation strategies provide only modest gains, whereas HRL-VNEAP consistently achieves the best performance across all metrics. Compared to the strongest tested baselines, HRL-VNEAP improves acceptance ratio by up to \\textbf{20.7\\%}, total revenue by up to \\textbf{36.2\\%}, and revenue-over-cost by up to \\textbf{22.1\\%}.

First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content.

Yet experimental annotation lags far behind the rapid growth of protein sequence data. Computational approaches address this gap by associating proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which encode functional knowledge through hierarchical relations and textual definitions. However, existing models often emphasize one modality over the other, limiting their ability to generalize, particularly to unseen or newly introduced GO terms that frequently arise as the ontology evolves, and making the previously trained models outdated. We present STAR-GO, a Transformer-based framework that jointly models the semantic and structural characteristics of GO terms to enhance zero-shot protein function prediction. STAR-GO integrates textual definitions with ontology graph structure to learn unified GO representations, which are processed in hierarchical order to propagate information from general to specific terms. These representations are then aligned with protein sequence embeddings to capture sequence-function relationships. STAR-GO achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior zero-shot generalization, demonstrating the utility of integrating semantics and structure for robust and adaptable protein function prediction.

DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks. Each mask is then described by a pooled pretrained visual feature and classified via template matching against a template bank built from annotated frames. On the CholecSeg8k dataset, DepSeg improves over a direct SAM2 auto segmentation baseline (35.9% vs. 14.7% mIoU) and maintains competitive performance even when using only 10--20% of the object templates.

The YOLO11n deep learning model is utilized, incorporating additional enhancements such as image slicing, ensemble learning, and bounding-box merging to significantly improve performance and minimize false detections. Furthermore, image processing techniques are applied to estimate the extent of the detected defects. Experimental results demonstrate real-time performance with high accuracy across a wide variety of defects, while minimizing false detections.

This dominant paradigm is computationally expensive, requiring large-scale datasets and architectural modifications, and frequently suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the model's original generative priors. Here, we propose InverseCrafter, an efficient inpainting inverse solver that reformulates the 4D generation task as an inpainting problem solved in the latent space.

Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant.

Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u5148\u9a8c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5c42\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4f4e\u5c42\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data.

However, Big Tech companies have increasingly acquired the edge in computational resources, big data, and talent. So far, it has been largely unclear how many papers the industry funds, how their citation impact compares to non-funded papers, and what drives industry interest. This study fills that gap by quantifying the number of industry-funded papers at 10 top AI conferences (e.g., ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, ACL) and their citation influence. We analyze about 49.8K papers, about 1.8M citations from AI papers to other papers, and about 2.3M citations from other papers to AI papers from 1998-2022 in Scopus. Through seven research questions, we examine the volume and evolution of industry funding in AI research, the citation impact of funded papers, the diversity and temporal range of their citations, and the subfields in which industry predominantly acts. Our findings reveal that industry presence has grown markedly since 2015, from less than 2 percent to more than 11 percent in 2020. Between 2018 and 2022, 12 percent of industry-funded papers achieved high citation rates as measured by the h5-index, compared to 4 percent of non-industry-funded papers and 2 percent of non-funded papers. Top AI conferences engage more with industry-funded research than non-funded research, as measured by our newly proposed metric, the Citation Preference Ratio (CPR). We show that industry-funded research is increasingly insular, citing predominantly other industry-funded papers while referencing fewer non-funded papers. These findings reveal new trends in AI research funding, including a shift towards more industry-funded papers and their growing citation impact, greater insularity of industry-funded work than non-funded work, and a preference of industry-funded research to cite recent work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u531610\u5927AI\u4f1a\u8bae\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u53ca\u5f15\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u5360\u6bd4\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u66f4\u5c01\u95ed\u7b49\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u884c\u4e1a\u5174\u8da3\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67901998 - 2022\u5e74Scopus\u4e2d\u7ea649.8K\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u3001\u7ea61.8M\u6761AI\u8bba\u6587\u95f4\u5f15\u7528\u548c\u7ea62.3M\u6761\u5176\u4ed6\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9AI\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e03\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "2015\u5e74\u540e\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u5360\u6bd4\u4ece\u4e0d\u8db32%\u5347\u81f32020\u5e74\u8d8511%\uff1b2018 - 2022\u5e74\uff0c\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u9ad8\u5f15\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u975e\u8d44\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\uff1b\u9876\u7ea7AI\u4f1a\u8bae\u66f4\u9752\u7750\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u5c01\u95ed\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u52a9\u5448\u73b0\u5411\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u503e\u659c\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u589e\u5927\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u8d44\u52a9\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u5c01\u95ed\u3001\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u7528\u8fd1\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b49\u65b0\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks.

However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS.

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u611f\u77e5\uff08AVP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e94\u8ba9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3b\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAVP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u8ba1\u5212 - \u89c2\u5bdf - \u53cd\u601d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad85.7%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u970018.4%\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u4ec5\u970012.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "AVP\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions.

A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u53cc\u5e73\u97622D X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c3D\u7ecf\u690e\u5f13\u6839\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0CT\u76843D\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4f9d\u8d56\u672f\u4e2d2D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u672f\u524d3D CT\u626b\u63cf\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u690e\u4f53\u6210\u5f62\u672f\u7b49\u672f\u524d\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c4\u505aCT\u7684\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u690e\u4f53\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5148\u4ece\u6b63\u4ea4X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u690e\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0eReVerteR\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u53cc\u690e\u5f13\u6839\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c38\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e2D - 3D\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0CT\u76843D\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6210\u50cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning.

A novel approach is introduced to enhance Phase-OTDR data analysis by transforming 1D data into grayscale images through techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field, Gramian Angular Summation Field, and Recurrence Plot. These grayscale images are combined into a multi-channel RGB representation, enabling more robust and adaptable analysis using transfer learning models. The proposed methodology achieves high classification accuracies of 98.84% and 98.24% with the EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121 models, respectively. A 5-fold cross-validation process confirms the reliability of these models, with test accuracy rates of 99.07% and 98.68%.

While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors as metrics, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that the uMLIPs encode chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\uff08uMLIPs\uff09\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f16\u7801\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540cuMLIPs\u5b66\u5230\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30uMLIPs\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "uMLIPs\u7f16\u7801\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u8d8b\u52bf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u7684\u4e32\u8054\u5c06MLIPs\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%.

However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6469\u64e6\u5b66\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea696%\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6469\u64e6\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u56fe\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u8fc8\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u56fe\u662f\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u65ad\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a32\u7ef4\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3CNN - MLP\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea696%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u6469\u64e6\u5b66\u53d8\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6469\u64e6\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u56fe\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faC3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u5757\u7ea7\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u9002\u5f53\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5728\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5c06\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5230RGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "C3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties.

Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge.

Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6c34\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578bAQUA - Net\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5149\u7167\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u989c\u8272\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAQUA - Net\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53cc\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5149\u7167\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5149\u7167\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66dd\u5149\u6821\u6b63\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u4e0b\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cAQUA - Net\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0eSOTA\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5149\u7167\u5206\u652f\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AQUA - Net\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6c34\u4e0b\u6210\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $\u03c0_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u5757\uff08RTC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u5757\uff08RTC\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9700\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u524d\u7f00\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6RTC\u5728\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6RTC\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6RTC\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6RTC\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
