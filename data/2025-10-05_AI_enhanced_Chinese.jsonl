We consider the problems where as property P , we are given a\nprescribed matrix for the duration, length, or earliest arrival time of\npairwise temporal paths. That is, we are given a matrix D and ask whether there\nis a temporal graph such that for any ordered pair of vertices (s, t), Ds,t\nequals the duration (length, or earliest arrival time, respectively) of any\ntemporal path from s to t minimizing that specific temporal path metric. For\nshortest and earliest arrival temporal paths, we are the first to consider\nthese problems as far as we know. We analyze these problems for many settings\nlike: strict and non-strict paths, periodic and non-periodic temporal graphs,\nand limited number of labels per edge (that is, limited occurrence number per\nedge over time). In contrast to all other path metrics, we show that for the\nearliest arrival times, we can achieve polynomial-time algorithms in periodic\nand non-periodic temporal graphs and for strict and and non-strict paths.\nHowever, the problem becomes NP-hard when the matrix does not contain a single\ninteger but a set or range of possible allowed values.

The leader's optimal strategy depends on\nthe distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning\nversion of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers\nwith types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal\nis to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility\nof the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design\nlearning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under\ntype feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round,\nwe design algorithms that achieve $\\mathcal O\\big(\\sqrt{\\min\\{L\\log(nKA T), nK\n\\} \\cdot T} \\big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\\mathcal\nO\\big(\\sqrt{\\min\\{L\\log(nKA T), K^n \\} \\cdot T} \\big)$ regret for general type\ndistributions.

SGD performs best\nin low-interaction regimes, but modeling the receiver as boundedly-rational and\ntuning the rationality constant still provides a flexible method for designing\ninferable schemes.

Here, by considering functional inter-individual\nvariability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an\nenhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC)\nextraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs\nself-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional\ninter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that\ngenerates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the\nabsence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel\naugmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core,\nVarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series\nprocessing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

Later, we employ open coding and thematic\nanalysis to categorize the reasons behind wontfix labels, providing a\nstructured understanding of the issue management landscape.

Then, we tightly characterize the SGIRs and GIRs of MNW, PS,\nand RR. In particular, the GIR of MNW is $2$ regardless of the coalition size.\nMoreover, for coalition size $c \\geq 1$, the SGIRs of MNW and PS, and the GIRs\nof PS and RR are $c + 1$.

We find that temperature shocks reduce\nideological polarisation and increase vote concentration, as voters consolidate\naround larger, more moderate parties.

However, their exponentially\nincreasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation.

Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,\nexisting VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception\nand reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance\nthese capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant\nconstraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction\nLearning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE\nformulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to\nprogressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates\nexecutable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the\nenvironment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.\nThrough this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model\nincrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via\nexploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only\nsubstantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,\nincreasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also\ndemonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an\naverage improvement of 3.1%.

This complexity is especially acute in large\nacademic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities\nacross multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling\nmust account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job\nsatisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical\nor rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain\nknowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information,\ne.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys\nand scheduling platforms.

Previous\nmachine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the\nautoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values.\nDue to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has\na huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large\nnumber of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the\nnon-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code\nin a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the\nNAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch\nquality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper\npropose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR\ntask. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the\nrepair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the\ninter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking\ninter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for\nalleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair\non three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that\n1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best\nperformance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR\ntechniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times\nin the GPU environment.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the\nmodel to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an\nindependent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the\nreward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when\nconditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to\nconditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense\nreward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream\nduring pretraining.

User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on\na coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a\nfine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as\nhaving scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively\nif the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on\nthe total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores\nand the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally\npartitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside\neach bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can\nbe queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a\nnear-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\\Theta(n^2)$\nusers (and therefore $\\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than\nthe $O(n\\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the\nadditional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate\nthresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score\nand threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the\ntightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity\nmatches our bound up to a logarithmic factor.

The submission\n  includes 10 pages and 6 figures", "summary": "Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,\nincluding safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased\nmaintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our\nknowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety\nchallenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408LQR\u4e0eRL\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3RL\u632f\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u6a21\u578bRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u5371\u5bb3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u5408LQR\u548cRL\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0cLQR\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7eafRL\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u632f\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers,\nwhich translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target\nfunction. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz\ndrivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models\nto automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers\nfrequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly\nstructured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially\ncrucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as\nreporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system\nand the team.\n  This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in\nOSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First,\nconstraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a\nfunction's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based\ncrash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether\nreported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark\nfunctions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes\nby up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that\nfrontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents.

To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric\nidentification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein\npatterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed\npigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a\nstandard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision\npipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and\nspatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then\nclassified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\nachieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision\nacross mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to\nclassification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating\nfeasibility for real-time farm deployment.

These two context representations transform the problem\nfrom inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.\nEvaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves\noverall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves\nsignificantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,\n+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the\nstrongest baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aLOGicalThought (LogT)\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u5e9f\u6b62\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u800cLLM\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLogT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7ea7\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u4e0eLLM\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u6307\u5357\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLogT\u4f7f\u6240\u6709LLM\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad811.84%\uff0c\u5728\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u8574\u542b\u548c\u53ef\u5e9f\u6b62\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LogT\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These\nmethods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption\nthat the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or \"important\", under the\ntest distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating\nthis assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of\nanisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural\nclassifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its\nrandomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,\nand then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several\nbenchmark point cloud datasets.

However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with\nstrong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most\ndata-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and\nstill suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods\navoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median\n(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise.

To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's\nability to function as a counselor.

Using this framework, we develop the VaPR\ndataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:\nLLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver\nsignificant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average\ngains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable\nimprovements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance\nconsistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at\nsmaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer \"Yes\" in binary\nquestions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we\nshow that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models\ntrained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on\n\\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

We study when it\nhelps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting\nfailure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We\nfocus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and\ncritic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of\nstrong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work\nshows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft\nActor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites\ninvolve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to\nsharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing\nin cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This\nreveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into\nalgorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues\nbehind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that\ninduce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy\ncoevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model\nvariance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes\nenables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to\noutperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance\npreviously reported in OpenAI Gym.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

However, a\npair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image\njailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking\ndifference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability\nof attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can\ntransfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not\nwithout geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and\nempirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we\nmathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks\ncompute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as\nsuccessful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak\nthe attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space\nattacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that\nrepresentation space attacks \\emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries\nare sufficiently aligned in post-projector space.

First, the system is able to simulate calibrated\neditorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority\noutcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt\nto field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains\nunwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring\ncompliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and\nscientific domains.

However, such claims are typically drawn from\nnarrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In\nthis work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse\ndimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model\narchitectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less\neffective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with\nthe evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,\npruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being\ncritical.

This alignment typically requires\nfine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time\nalignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,\nmodifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards\ngenerating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward\nhacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate\nsignificantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization\nis insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit\nimage-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward\nhAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an\nimage-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory\nwith a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can\nincrease without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable\napproximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple\nrewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,\nAnimal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\\% win rate vs. strong baselines while\npreserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero\ndrift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases.

In parallel,\nreinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise\nmulti-objective optimization in protein design.

We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four\ndomains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody\nengineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model\nclasses, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it\nreveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning.

TRAAC also shows strong generalization:\nalthough our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and\nefficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,\nand OptimalThinkingBench.

However,\nin many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation\nedits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to\ndetect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:\ndetecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs.

In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the\nunderlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on\nhistorical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment\noptimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant\nchallenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we\nintroduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that\nleverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under\ngeneral choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data\ndistribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full\ncoverage of all feasible assortments.

This can affect the\nmodel's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic\nreport a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that\nfairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing\nhyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models\n(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common\npractice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)\ncomparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and\n2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that\na disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact\non another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters\ndirectly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate\nimpact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness\ntrade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We\nstress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional\nprivacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,\nutility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a\nvariant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and\nconclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to\nhyperparameter choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790DPSGD\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u6548\u7528 - \u516c\u5e73\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u6574\u4f1a\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\uff0cDPSGD - Global - Adapt\u975e\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3aDPSGD\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u89c2\u70b9\u79f0\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u53ef\u4f7f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8fbe\u975e\u79c1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6b64\u8bf4\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83DPSGD\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8d85\u53c2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u62d3\u5c55\u5230DPSGD - Global - Adapt\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u610f\u5473\u7740\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e5f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u51cf\u8f7bDPSGD\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u6548\u7528 - \u516c\u5e73\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u6574\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u989d\u5916\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff1bDPSGD - Global - Adapt\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u6574\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0cDPSGD - Global - Adapt\u4e0d\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We challenge this convention by\nproposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections\noperate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow\nbottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental\nrefinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched\ndesigns. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift\ninput signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can\nremain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient\ntraining and inference implementations.

At\nthe same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt\ninjection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.\nIn this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive\nbenchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We\nbegin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the\nthreat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign\nsamples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text\nsegments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign\nimages from two categories.

Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection,\nleaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs.

Using seven LLMs from five\nfamilies as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code\nagents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27%\nrun end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~\n100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the\nmulti-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly\ndeployable attack code.

Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit\ndeficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior\nGNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual\nimperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is\nstill missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation\ncomparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving\ntheir merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study\nthat benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,\nrevealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM\naugmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we\npropose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement\n(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is\nthe first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,\ndiverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through\niterative graph contrastive learning.

Existing MTS anomaly\ndetection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,\nprediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two\nkey challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based\nand prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to\ninaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often\nunderuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised\nlearning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture\nlocal relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the\nscarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a\nsupervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection\nframework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while\nproviding detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel\nmultivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time\nseries data into image representations, capturing relationships across\nvariables and timestamps.

Semi-supervised\nGAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during\ntraining, is among the most widely explored application settings.

GraphNC includes two main components,\nanomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality\nregularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by\naligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to\naccurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in\nthe teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of\nthe normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more\nseparable anomaly scores.

The speech\ndata pairs a children's speech corpus with instructional speech extracted from\nYouTube videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.\nExperiments on clean and noisy speech show that RealClass closely approximates\nreal classroom speech, making it a valuable asset in the absence of abundant\nreal classroom speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u5408\u6210\u6559\u5ba4\u566a\u58f0\u548cRIRs\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaRealClass\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u5ba4\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6559\u5ba4\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57dfAI\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6559\u5ba4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u516c\u5f00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u7528\u6559\u5ba4\u566a\u58f0\u548cRIR\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u5408\u6210\u6559\u5ba4\u566a\u58f0\u548cRIRs\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6559\u5ba4\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u6559\u5ba4\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684RealClass\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u5608\u6742\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRealClass\u80fd\u7d27\u5bc6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u5ba4\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u5ba4\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cRealClass\u662f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Building upon the foundations of diffusion\nmodels, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient\ntraining, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap.

In contrast, other\ngenerative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction\nloss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high\nprecision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's\nover-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems\nsuch as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by\nFM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models.

A central challenge in this area is\nthat learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,\ncarefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as\nmodel zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large\ncomputational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations\nin scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a\nweight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,\nunstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model\nzoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in\narchitecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the\nmethodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight\nspace backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations.

Iran is one of the largest\ncountries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest\ncountry in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy\nconsumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in\ncold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,\nespecially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This\nstudy aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in\nZanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and\na hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and\nmeteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were\ntrained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption\npatterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model\noutperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean\nSquared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean\nPercentage Error (MPE).

To reduce\ncontrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating\nsynthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a\nmulti-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs\nsegmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared\nsemantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep\nlearning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while\nsimultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach\nintegrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,\nenabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical\nsegmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires\nno initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder\nand decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training\nstrategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common\nconstraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of\n264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task\nand multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61\ndB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,\nit improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus\nDice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to\nmore accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm\nfrom 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to\nnnU-Net.

While\ninitially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have\ndemonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models\nrequire mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically\nusing recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales\nquadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long\nsequences.\n  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces\nself-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to\nreduce sequence length.

However, real-world\ndata are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional\ndistributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is\nused for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,\nneglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning\nability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this\npaper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in\nfactorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address\nthis challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those\nwith strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs.

In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a\nreasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as\neffective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose\nExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that\norganizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy\nobjective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on\nfive backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently\nimproves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an\naverage gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO\nstabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods\nfail.

Further, current datasets mostly contain\ninformation about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city\nroad networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much\ndenser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide\na more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting\nby releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with\nthe largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold\nincrease relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road\nfeatures and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic\nspeed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show\nthat most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic\nforecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this\nissue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that\nuses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus\nachieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger\nforecasting performance.

The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis\n(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in\nchoosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior\nknowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often\nunavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise.

To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive\nbias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,\nencouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond\nany single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training\nplatform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch\nparallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single\ntraining run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.\nTheoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator\ninductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim\nsubstantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for\nexample, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim\nbaseline.

To closely match the\nstatistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise\nvia the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC\nmodem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches\nbased on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the\nlength of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate\ncyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss\nfunction to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training\ndataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various\napplications.

The training datasets include (1) a\npiecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a\nfrequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC\nsystems.

The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically\ngrounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a\ndiscrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a\npacket of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector\nthat quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with\nsubjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience.\nInputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules\n(abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an\nIIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to\nbehavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop.\nThis explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term\nmemory and action.

While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models\nand large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs).

In this work, we propose\nthe first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We\nprove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during\ninstruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model\nparameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model\nduring training.

Under review for Applied Energy", "summary": "Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer\nsignificant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial\nengineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises\ngreater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in\nreal-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing\nchallenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To\ninvestigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC\nand a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month\nperiod in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana.\nThis investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC\nimplementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced\ncontrollers were evaluated against each other and against the existing\ncontroller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\\% relative to the\nexisting controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\\%), albeit with\nmodestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were\nnormalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior\nperformance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces\nengineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and\noperational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of\nsafe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions\nand their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online\nlearning in a live environment.

The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved\noutput accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates\nfor tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the\nsuccessful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to\nfive regenerations.

We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture\nhuman-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this\nstructure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we\nintroduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on\n250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality\ngap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align\nbetter with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap\nby fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our\nnovel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning\npairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields\nsignificantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in\nterms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance\npartitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance\nwith language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured\nby the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find\nthat human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective\nattributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the\npretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video\nmodels' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning\nshapes video representations toward human social perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u6b64\u7ed3\u6784\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u8d8549000\u4e2a\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4 - RSA\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5bf9TimeSformer\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u5dee\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u6355\u6349\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4f7f\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We argue that reducing the technical requirements to enter\nbounty programmes is important to include those without coding experience.\nGiven the limited adoption of bias bounties, future efforts should explore the\ntransferability of the best practices from bug bounties and examine how such\nprogrammes can be designed to be sensitive to underrepresented groups while\nlowering adoption barriers for organisations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8c03\u7814AI\u504f\u89c1\u8d4f\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5df2\u6709\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u4e0e\u53d7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u793e\u533a\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u8d4f\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u641c\u7d22Google\u3001Google Scholar\u3001PhilPapers\u548cIEEE Xplore\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u504f\u89c1\u8d4f\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u8d4f\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u4e94\u7bc7\u7814\u7a76\u51fa\u7248\u7269\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8ba1\u5212\u7531\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3e\u529e\uff0c\u4e3a\u9650\u65f6\u7ade\u8d5b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u964d\u4f4e\u8d4f\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8981\u6c42\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7528\u95e8\u69db\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002"}}

In\nthis work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments\npre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a\nMixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and\ngeneration within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve\nvisual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete\nrepresentation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel\ntokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual\ndetails with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length.

This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep\nlearning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the\nstructure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent\ntensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input\ninduces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the\ncomputationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known\nclosed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)\nand investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a\nmapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on\nwhich the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that\ndelivers low computational complexity and strong generalization.

In this paper, we investigate an\nunderexplored measure for identifying high-impact research: authors' own\nrankings of their multiple submissions to the same AI conference. Grounded in\ngame-theoretic reasoning, we hypothesize that self-rankings are informative\nbecause authors possess unique understanding of their work's conceptual depth\nand long-term promise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale\nexperiment at a leading AI conference, where 1,342 researchers self-ranked\ntheir 2,592 submissions by perceived quality.

We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses,\nfocusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g.,\ngreedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on\nsynthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss\npreserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained\ndistinctions in the learned representations.

With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow\nmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly\nstronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization\nadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving\nbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.\nFor evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)\nfeaturing region-level dragging instructions.

We propose $\\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training\nframework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using\nfine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)\nwithin a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided\n$\\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global\n$\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment.

We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which\nconvexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to\niteratively refine pseudo-labels.

While existing work has\nprimarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or\nmodalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to\ninvestigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:\n$\\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively\ntransfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating\nEnglish-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a\nmetric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that\ncross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target\nlanguage, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that\nmodels with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on\nEnglish-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.\nTo address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study.

However, their reliance on transformer\narchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when\nextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive\nformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from\nshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in\nlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video\nteachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on\nexploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the\nstudent model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.\nOur method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to\n20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure\nand error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous\nmethods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of\ngenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the\nmaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x\nlonger than that of our baseline model.

We\npropose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the\nvariational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice\nand Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their\nobservations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high\nagreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is\nrealized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial\ntraining. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction\nreconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is\nguaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study\nphysical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely\non the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus\nsuffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility\nscenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated\nsensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps\nmeasured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified\nthrough both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)\nmeasurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's\nposition. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of\nboth the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation\nmethod.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u7efc\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6709\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6cd5\u65b9\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5171\u8ba8\u8bba\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u968f\u673a\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6570\u6216\u5bc6\u94a5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u6982\u7387\u91cf\u5316\uff08VPQ\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7801\u504f\u79fb\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8349\u56fe\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb - \u89d2\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u3002"}}

Using this strategy we train video diffusion\nmodels (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements of object interactions in real scenes.

Conventional methods prioritize correlation or fit, often\noverlooking confounding variables and limiting generalizability to unseen\ntropical storms. To address this, we leverage a multidata causal discovery\nframework with a replicated dataset based on Statistical Hurricane Intensity\nPrediction Scheme (SHIPS) using ERA5 meteorological reanalysis. We conduct\nmultiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to\nhurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to\ncompare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random\nforest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24\nto 120 hours). Causal feature selection consistently outperforms on unseen test\ncases, especially for lead times shorter than 3 days. The causal features\nprimarily include vertical shear, mid-tropospheric potential vorticity and\nsurface moisture conditions, which are physically significant yet often\nunderutilized in hurricane intensity predictions. Further, we build an extended\npredictor set (SHIPS+) by adding selected features to the standard SHIPS\npredictors. SHIPS+ yields increased short-term predictive skill at lead times\nof 24, 48, and 72 hours. Adding nonlinearity using multilayer perceptron\nfurther extends skill to longer lead times, despite our framework being purely\nregional and not requiring global forecast data.

Prior works have investigated representational alignment between\nartificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings\nare indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations\nthemselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features\nfrom neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.\nThis leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual\ninformation is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,\nand whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful\nsubspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages\nthe generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the\nvisual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first\nuses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent\nsubspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information\n(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific\nvisual-semantic features encoded by each latent group.

We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant\nsegmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with\n3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the\n2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated\nfeatures.

Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists,\ngiven the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to\nthe classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher\ninformation matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization\nof the relative entropy or the R\\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I\nderive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\\alpha$-$z$, and\ngeometric R\\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so\nbeing the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives.\nInterestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha$,\nthe log-Euclidean R\\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information\nmatrix, and the geometric R\\'enyi relative entropy leads to the\nright-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting\ninformation matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative\nvalues of the R\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha$ even though the original quantities do\nnot.

We then\nfine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target\ntemporal artifacts and generation complexity.
