We focus on minimizing \\emph{recourse} which equals the number of recolored edges per edge updates.\n  We present a new technique based on an object which we call a \\emph{shift-tree}. This object tracks multiple possible recolorings of $G$ and enables us to maintain a proper coloring with small recourse in polynomial time. We shift colors over a path of edges, but unlike many other algorithms, we do not use \\emph{fans} and \\emph{alternating bicolored paths}.\n  We combine the shift-tree with additional techniques to obtain an algorithm with a \\emph{tight} recourse of $O\\big( \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\frac{\u0394+C}{\u0394-C}}\\big)$ for all $C \\ge 0.62\u0394$ where $\u0394-C = O(n^{1-\u03b4})$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm to establish tight bounds for large palettes, and the first to do so when $\u0394-C=o(\u0394)$. This result settles the theoretical complexity of the recourse for large palettes. Furthermore, we believe that viewing the possible shifts as a tree can lead to similar tree-based techniques that extend to lower values of $C$, and to improved update times.\n  A second application is to graphs with low arboricity $\u03b1$. Previous works [BCPS24, CRV24] achieve $O(\u03b5^{-1}\\log n)$ recourse per update with $C\\ge (4+\u03b5)\u03b1$, and we improve by achieving the same recourse while only requiring $C \\ge (2+\u03b5)\u03b1- 1$. This result is $\u0394$-adaptive, i.e., it uses $\u0394_t+C$ colors where $\u0394_t$ is the current maximum degree.\n  Trying to understand the limitations of our technique, and shift-based algorithms in general, we show a separation between the recourse achievable by algorithms that only shift colors along a path, and more general algorithms such as ones using the Nibbling Method [BGW21, BCPS24].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4(\u0394+C)-\u8fb9\u7740\u8272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eshift - tree\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5177\u6709\u7d27\u754c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6811\u5ea6\u56fe\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u79fb\u8272\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4(\u0394+C)-\u8fb9\u7740\u8272\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fb9\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u7740\u8272\u7684\u8fb9\u6570\uff08recourse\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eshift - tree\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u201cfans\u201d\u548c\u201calternating bicolored paths\u201d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fb9\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u79fb\u8272\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u7740\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5177\u6709\u7d27recourse\u4e3aO( log n / log((\u0394 + C) / (\u0394 - C)) )\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u4f4e\u6811\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u9700C \u2265 (2 + \u03b5)\u03b1 - 1\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230O(\u03b5\u207b\u00b9log n)\u7684recourse\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u4ec5\u6cbf\u8def\u5f84\u79fb\u8272\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684recourse\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u4e0brecourse\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0cshift - tree\u6280\u672f\u6709\u671b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684C\u503c\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

We first introduce an exact algorithm for the diameter variant of the problem, which identifies pairs of near-optimal medians that are maximally diverse. Subsequently, we propose a $(1-\u03b5)$-approximation algorithm (for any $\u03b5>0$) for sum dispersion, as well as a bi-criteria approximation algorithm for the more challenging min dispersion case, allowing the generation of multiple (more than two) diverse near-optimal Hamming medians.

However, existing GPU-based solutions remain inefficient, as they typically rely on a single, fixed queue design that incurs severe synchronization overhead, high memory latency, and poor adaptivity to diverse inputs. To address these inefficiencies, we propose MultiLevelMultiQueue (MLMQ), a novel data structure that distributes multiple queues across the GPU's multi-level parallelism and memory hierarchy. To realize MLMQ, we introduce a cache-like collaboration mechanism for efficient inter-queue coordination, and develop a modular queue design based on unified Read and Write primitives. Within this framework, we expand the optimization space by designing a set of GPU-friendly queues, composing them across multiple levels, and further providing an input-adaptive MLMQ configuration scheme.

We show that computing an autobidding equilibrium that approximates the welfare-optimal one within a factor of $2 - \u03b5$ is NP-hard for any constant $\u03b5> 0$. Moreover, deciding whether there exists an autobidding equilibrium that attains a $1/2 + \u03b5$ fraction of the optimal welfare -- unfettered by equilibrium constraints -- is NP-hard for any constant $\u03b5> 0$. This hardness result is tight in view of the fact that the price of anarchy (PoA) is at most $2$, and shows that deciding whether a non-trivial autobidding equilibrium exists -- one that is even marginally better than the worst-case guarantee -- is intractable. For revenue, we establish a stronger logarithmic inapproximability, while under the projection games conjecture, our reduction rules out even a polynomial approximation factor.

Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem.

In this work, we show that learning either axonal or dendritic delays enables deep feedforward SNNs composed of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons to reach accuracy comparable to existing synaptic delay learning approaches, while significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. SNN models with either axonal or dendritic delays achieve up to $95.58\\%$ on the Google Speech Command (GSC) and $80.97\\%$ on the Spiking Speech Command (SSC) datasets, matching or exceeding prior methods based on synaptic delays or more complex neuron models. By adjusting the delay parameters, we obtain improved performance for synaptic delay learning baselines, strengthening the comparison. We find that axonal delays offer the most favorable trade-off, combining lower buffering requirements with slightly higher accuracy than dendritic delays. We further show that the performance of axonal and dendritic delay models is largely preserved under strong delay sparsity, with as few as $20\\%$ of delays remaining active, further reducing buffering requirements. Overall, our results indicate that learnable axonal and dendritic delays provide a resource-efficient and effective mechanism for temporal representation in SNNs.

Recent advances in model scaling have shown promising gains in recommendation. However, naively increasing model capacity imposes prohibitive online inference costs and often yields diminishing returns for sparse tasks with skewed label distributions. This mismatch between uniform parameter scaling and heterogeneous task capacity demands poses a fundamental challenge for scalable multi-task recommendation. In this work, we investigate parameter sparsification as a principled scaling paradigm and identify two critical obstacles when applying sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to multi-task recommendation: exploded expert activation that undermines instance-level sparsity and expert load skew caused by independent task-wise routing. To address these challenges, we propose SMES, a scalable sparse MoE framework with progressive expert routing. SMES decomposes expert activation into a task-shared expert subset jointly selected across tasks and task-adaptive private experts, explicitly bounding per-instance expert execution while preserving task-specific capacity. In addition, SMES introduces a global multi-gate load-balancing regularizer that stabilizes training by regulating aggregated expert utilization across all tasks. SMES has been deployed in Kuaishou large-scale short-video services, supporting over 400 million daily active users.

Existing systems and compiler-based approaches offer reliability but are either heavyweight or support only a limited set of optimizations. Conversely, using LLMs in a per-program optimization methodology can synthesize nontrivial optimizations, but is unreliable, expensive, and offers a low yield. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach that works in a 3-stage manner that decouples discovery from deployment and connects them via a novel bridge. First, it discovers per-program optimizations (discovery). Second, they are converted into generalised rewrite rules (bridge).

However, existing methods encounter an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations. The prevalent single token paradigm fails to fully leverage the inherent strength of self-attention in encoding token sequences, and degenerates into a weighted sum of node signals. To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies. Our method can yield more expressive graph representations by modeling complex interactions among multiple graph tokens. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several graph-level benchmarks.

Despite its empirical success, a general theoretical understanding of when and why persistent entropy reliably detects phase transitions has remained limited, particularly in stochastic and data-driven settings. In this work, we establish a general, model-independent theorem providing sufficient conditions under which persistent entropy provably separates two phases. We show that persistent entropy exhibits an asymptotically non-vanishing gap across phases. The result relies only on continuity of persistent entropy along the convergent diagram sequence, or under mild regularization, and is therefore broadly applicable across data modalities, filtrations, and homological degrees. To connect asymptotic theory with finite-time computations, we introduce an operational framework based on topological stabilization, defining a topological transition time by stabilizing a chosen topological statistic over sliding windows, and a probability-based estimator of critical parameters within a finite observation horizon. We validate the framework on the Kuramoto synchronization transition, the Vicsek order-to-disorder transition in collective motion, and neural network training dynamics across multiple datasets and architectures.

In this paper, we examine the dynamics of autobidders who optimize value subject to a return-on-spend (RoS) constraint under uniform bid scaling. Our main set of results show that simple autobidding dynamics can exhibit formally chaotic behavior. This significantly strengthens the recent results of Leme, Piliouras, Schneider, Spendlove, and Zuo (EC '24) that went as far as quasiperiodicity. Our proof proceeds by establishing that autobidding dynamics can simulate -- up to an arbitrarily small error -- a broad class of continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems. This class contains as a special case Chua's circuit, a classic chaotic system renowned for its iconic double scroll attractor. Our reduction develops several modular gadgets, which we anticipate will find other applications going forward. Moreover, in discrete time, we show that different incarnations of mirror descent can exhibit Li-Yorke chaos, topological transitivity, and sensitivity to initial conditions, connecting along the way those dynamics to classic dynamical systems such as the logistic map and the Ricker population model.

To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs.

However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations.

While recent scaling efforts have improved model capacity, they often fail to construct both context-aware and context-independent user intent from the long-term and real-time behavior sequence. Meanwhile, recent work also suffers from inefficient and homogeneous interaction mechanisms, leading to suboptimal prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose HeMix, a scalable ranking model that unifies adaptive sequence tokenization and heterogeneous interaction structure. Specifically, HeMix introduces a Query-Mixed Interest Extraction module that jointly models context-aware and context-independent user interests via dynamic and fixed queries over global and real-time behavior sequences. For interaction, we replace self-attention with the HeteroMixer block, enabling efficient, multi-granularity cross-feature interactions that adopt the multi-head token fusion, heterogeneous interaction and group-aligned reconstruction pipelines. HeMix demonstrates favorable scaling behavior, driven by the HeteroMixer block, where increasing model scale via parameter expansion leads to steady improvements in recommendation accuracy. Experiments on industrial-scale datasets show that HeMix scales effectively and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions.

Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Growing complexity in incentive structures has expanded the applicability of blockchain beyond purely transactional use. Existing research predominantly examines token economies within specific use cases, proposes conceptual frameworks, or studies isolated aspects such as governance, incentive design, and tokenomics. However, the literature offers limited empirically grounded, end-to-end guidance that integrates these dimensions into a coherent, step-by-step design approach informed by concrete token-economy development efforts. To address this gap, this paper presents the Token Economy Design Method (TEDM), a design-science artifact that synthesizes stepwise design propositions for token-economy design across incentives, governance, and tokenomics. TEDM is derived through an iterative qualitative synthesis of prior contributions and refined through a co-designed case. The artifact is formatively evaluated via the Currynomics case study and additional expert interviews. Currynomics is an ecosystem that maintains the Redcurry stablecoin, using real estate as the underlying asset. TEDM is positioned as reusable design guidance that facilitates the analysis of foundational requirements of tokenized ecosystems.

Because NPE is estimated under the training data distribution, it is susceptible to misspecification when observations deviate from the training distribution. Many robust SBI approaches address this by modifying NPE training or introducing error models, coupling robustness to the inference network and compromising amortization and modularity. We introduce minimum-distance summaries, a plug-in robust NPE method that adapts queried test-time summaries independently of the pretrained NPE. Leveraging the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a distance between observed data and a summary-conditional predictive distribution, the adapted summary inherits strong robustness properties from the MMD. We demonstrate that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently with random Fourier feature approximations, yielding a lightweight, model-free test-time adaptation procedure.

This metric is widely used in marketing, for example, to select customers for a marketing campaign. However, modeling CLV is challenging. When relying on customers' purchase histories, the input data is sparse. Additionally, given its long-term focus, prediction horizons are often longer than estimation periods. Probabilistic models are able to overcome these challenges and, thus, are a popular option among researchers and practitioners. The latter also appreciate their applicability for both small and big data as well as their robust predictive performance without any fine-tuning requirements. Their popularity is due to three characteristics: data parsimony, scalability, and predictive accuracy. The R package CLVTools provides an efficient and user-friendly implementation framework to apply key probabilistic models such as the Pareto/NBD and Gamma-Gamma model. Further, it provides access to the latest model extensions to include time-invariant and time-varying covariates, parameter regularization, and equality constraints.

Each agent holds a sensitive data point and decides whether to participate in a data-sharing coalition and how much noise to add to their data. Privacy choices induce a fundamental trade-off: higher privacy reduces individual data-sharing costs but degrades data utility and statistical accuracy for the coalition. These choices generate externalities across agents, making both participation and privacy levels strategic. Our goal is to understand which coalitions are stable, how privacy choices shape equilibrium outcomes, and how decentralized data sharing compares to a centralized, socially optimal benchmark.\n  We provide a comprehensive equilibrium analysis across a broad range of privacy-cost regimes, from decreasing costs (e.g., privacy amplification from pooling data) to increasing costs (e.g., greater exposure to privacy attacks in larger coalitions). We first characterize Nash equilibrium coalitions with endogenous privacy levels and show that equilibria may fail to exist and can be non-monotonic in problem parameters. We also introduce a weaker equilibrium notion called robust equilibrium (that allows more widespread equilibrium existence by equipping existing players in the coalition with the power to prevent or veto external players from joining) and fully characterize such equilibria. Finally, we analyze, for both Nash and robust equilibria, the efficiency relative to the social optimum in terms of social welfare and estimator accuracy.

We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%.

In industrial deployment, two common approaches exhibit fundamental limitations: discrete semantic abstractions sacrifice descriptive precision through clustering, while dense multimodal embeddings are extracted independently and remain weakly aligned with ranking optimization, limiting fine-grained content-aware ranking. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{SARM}, an end-to-end ranking architecture that integrates natural-language semantic anchors directly into ranking optimization, enabling fine-grained author representations conditioned on multimodal content. Each semantic anchor is represented as learnable text tokens jointly optimized with ranking features, allowing the model to adapt content descriptions to ranking objectives. A lightweight dual-token gated design captures domain-specific live-streaming semantics, while an asymmetric deployment strategy preserves low-latency online training and serving.

However, existing approaches often rely heavily on README files and other metadata, which are frequently missing, limiting their applicability in real-world large-scale settings. We present DRAGON, a repository classifier designed for very large and diverse software collections. It operates entirely on lightweight signals commonly stored in version control systems: file and directory names, and optionally the README when available. In repository classification at scale, DRAGON improves F1@5 from 54.8% to 60.8%, surpassing the state of the art. DRAGON remains effective even when README files are absent, with performance degrading by only 6% w.r.t. when they are present. This robustness makes it practical for real-world settings where documentation is sparse or inconsistent. Furthermore, many of the remaining classification errors are near misses, where predicted labels are semantically close to the correct topics. This property increases the practical value of the predictions in real-world software collections, where suggesting a few related topics can still guide search and discovery. As a byproduct of developing DRAGON, we also release the largest open dataset to date for repository classification, consisting of 825 thousand repositories with associated ground-truth topics, sourced from the Software Heritage archive, providing a foundation for future large-scale and language-agnostic research on software repository understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRAGON\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u5e03\u6700\u5927\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56README\u7b49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1DRAGON\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u548c\u76ee\u5f55\u540d\uff0c\u53ef\u9009\u4f7f\u7528README\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ed3\u5e93\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2dF1@5\u4ece54.8%\u63d0\u5347\u523060.8%\uff0c\u65e0README\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u964d6%\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "DRAGON\u5728\u6587\u6863\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A popular class of dependence models for spatial extremes is that of random location-scale mixtures, in which a spatial \"baseline\" process is multiplied or shifted by a random variable, potentially altering its extremal dependence behaviour. Gaussian location-scale mixtures retain benefits of their Gaussian baseline processes while overcoming some of their limitations, such as symmetry, light tails and weak tail dependence. We review properties of Gaussian location-scale mixtures and develop novel constructions with interesting features, together with a general algorithm for conditional simulation from these models. We leverage their flexibility to propose extended extreme-value models, that allow for appropriately modelling not only the tails but also the bulk of the data. This is important in many applications and avoids the need to explicitly select the events considered as extreme. We propose new solutions for likelihood inference in parametric models of Gaussian location-scale mixtures, in order to avoid the numerical bottleneck given by the latent location and scale variables that can lead to high computational cost of standard likelihood evaluations. The effectiveness of the models and of the inference methods is confirmed with simulated data examples, and we present an application to wildfire-related weather variables in Portugal.

Existing research consensus protocols rarely discuss reconfiguration. Those that do tightly couple membership changes to a specific algorithm.

Instead, modularity is essential for maintainability and system evolution in production deployments. We present Gauss, a reconfiguration engine designed to treat consensus protocols as interchangeable modules. By introducing a distinction between a consensus protocol's inner log and a sanitized outer log exposed to the RSM node, Gauss allows engineers to upgrade membership, failure thresholds, and the consensus protocol itself independently and with minimal global downtime.

In this paper, we propose Correlation-Aware AMA (CA-AMA), a novel framework that augments AMA with a new correlation-aware payment. We show that any CA-AMA preserves the DSIC property and formalize finding optimal CA-AMA as a constraint optimization problem subject to the IR constraint.

For optimizing CA-AMA, we design a practical two-stage training algorithm. We derive that the target function's continuity and the generalization bound on the degree of deviation from strict IR.

Since these models are not originally trained for recommendation tasks, recent works efficiently adapt them via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, even with PEFT, item embeddings from multimodal foundation models remain user-blind: item embeddings are not conditioned on user interests, despite the fact that users with diverse interests attend to different item aspects. To address this limitation, we propose PerPEFT, a personalized PEFT strategy for multimodal recommendation. Specifically, PerPEFT groups users by interest and assigns a distinct PEFT module to each group, enabling each module to capture the fine-grained item aspects most predictive of that group`s purchase decisions. We further introduce a specialized training technique that strengthens this user-group conditioning. Notably, PerPEFT is PEFT-agnostic and can be paired with any PEFT method applicable to multimodal foundation models. Through extensive experiments, we show that (1) PerPEFT outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 15.3% (NDCG@20) and (2) delivers consistent gains across diverse PEFT variants. It is noteworthy that, even with personalization, PEFT remains lightweight, adding only 1.3% of the parameter count of the foundation model.

We demonstrate that this collapse is a fundamental information-theoretic failure, where strong Kullback-Leibler pressure promotes marginal independence at the expense of the latent channel's semantic informativeness. By formalizing this mechanism in a linear-Gaussian setting, we prove that for $\u03b2> 1$, stationarity-induced dynamics trigger a spectral contraction of the encoder gain, driving latent-factor mutual information to zero. To resolve this, we introduce the $\u03bb\u03b2$-VAE, which decouples regularization pressure from informational collapse via an auxiliary $L_2$ reconstruction penalty $\u03bb$. Extensive experiments on dSprites, Shapes3D, and MPI3D-real confirm that $\u03bb> 0$ stabilizes disentanglement and restores latent informativeness over a significantly broader range of $\u03b2$, providing a principled theoretical justification for dual-parameter regularization in variational inference backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6307\u51fa\u03b2 - VAE\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u6027\u80fd\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u03bb\u03b2 - VAE\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u03b2 - VAE\u5728\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0b\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u81ea\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u03bb\u03b2 - VAE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9L2\u91cd\u5efa\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u03bb\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u538b\u529b\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5728dSprites\u3001Shapes3D\u548cMPI3D - real\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u03bb > 0\u80fd\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u03b2\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u53c2\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We study the effect of LLM routing with respect to user behavior. We propose a game between an LLM provider with two models (standard and reasoning) and a user who can re-prompt or abandon tasks if the routed model cannot solve them. The user's goal is to maximize their utility minus the delay from using the model, while the provider minimizes the cost of servicing the user. We solve this Stackelberg game by fully characterizing the user best response and simplifying the provider problem. We observe that in nearly all cases, the optimal routing policy involves a static policy with no cascading that depends on the expected utility of the models to the user. Furthermore, we reveal a misalignment gap between the provider-optimal and user-preferred routes when the user's and provider's rankings of the models with respect to utility and cost differ. Finally, we demonstrate conditions for extreme misalignment where providers are incentivized to throttle the latency of the models to minimize their costs, consequently depressing user utility. The results yield simple threshold rules for single-provider, single-user interactions and clarify when routing, cascading, and throttling help or harm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8def\u7531\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u63ed\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLM\u8def\u7531\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\uff08\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u7531\u653f\u7b56\u662f\u9759\u6001\u65e0\u7ea7\u8054\u7684\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u6700\u4f18\u548c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u8def\u7531\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5dee\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u51cf\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f97\u51fa\u5355\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u3001\u5355\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u9608\u503c\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8def\u7531\u3001\u7ea7\u8054\u548c\u8282\u6d41\u7684\u5229\u5f0a\u3002"}}

Existing pruning methods are overly conservative for bounds-only spatial data because they do not fully capture its directional semantics, thereby missing opportunities to skip unneeded partitions at the earliest stages of a join.

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information.

Objective: This paper presents initial results toward establishing an RR template for Software Engineering controlled experiments using the Open Science Framework (OSF). Method: We analyzed templates of selected OSF RR types in light of documentation guidelines for controlled experiments. Results: The observed lack of rigor motivated our investigation of OSF-based RR types. Our analysis showed that, although one of the RR types aligned with many of the documentation suggestions contained in the guidelines, none of them covered the guidelines comprehensively. The study also highlights limitations in OSF RR template customization. Conclusion: Despite progress in ESE, planning and documenting experiments still lack rigor, compromising reproducibility. Adopting OSF-based RRs is proposed. However, no currently available RR type fully satisfies the guidelines. Establishing RR-specific guidelines for SE is deemed essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u6ce8\u518c\u62a5\u544a\uff08RR\uff09\u6a21\u677f\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u5206\u6790OSF\u4e0aRR\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f46\u5f53\u524dRR\u7c7b\u578b\u672a\u5168\u9762\u6ee1\u8db3\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acbSE\u4e13\u5c5eRR\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08ESE\uff09\u793e\u533a\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0cRR\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684RR\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6587\u6863\u6307\u5357\u5206\u6790\u6240\u9009OSF RR\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "result": "RR\u7c7b\u578b\u672a\u5168\u9762\u6db5\u76d6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6587\u6863\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4e14OSF RR\u6a21\u677f\u5b9a\u5236\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "ESE\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8bb0\u5f55\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eOSF\u7684RR\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dRR\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acbSE\u4e13\u5c5eRR\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

In this work, we embrace the idea of looping back to move forward: reusing model parameters through recursive refinement to extract stronger multimodal representations without increasing model size. We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available.

While Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) has emerged as a potential architecture to decouple compute and memory resources, its performance boundaries compared to standard large-scale Expert Parallelism (EP) remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of AFD by extending the roofline model to the communication level, correlating interconnect bandwidth, arithmetic intensity, and Hardware FLOPS Utilization (HFU). Our analysis reveals a dead zone on standard clusters: increasing FFN instance count fails to improve HFU as computational workload is capped by scale-out bandwidth, causing operator active time to shrink relative to the fixed latency budget. We further show that AFD's discrete node-level scaling incurs higher imbalance penalties than EP's continuous batch adjustment. Nevertheless, these limitations diminish under specific conditions: Superpod-class hardware with abundant interconnect bandwidth and models with coarse-grained experts and lower sparsity are more likely to benefit from AFD.

We introduce the ``Connected Minds'' model, which unifies these frameworks by integrating iterative reasoning with a parameterized network bias. We posit that agents do not observe the global population; rather, they observe a sample biased by their network position, governed by a locality parameter $p$ representing algorithmic ranking, social homophily, or information disclosure. We show that this parameter acts as a continuous bridge: the model collapses to the myopic Level-$k$ recursion as networks become opaque ($p \\to 0$) and recovers the standard Cognitive Hierarchy model under full transparency ($p=1$). Theoretically, we establish that network opacity induces a \\emph{Sophisticated Bias}, causing agents to systematically overestimate the cognitive depth of their opponents while preserving the log-concavity of belief distributions. This makes $p$ an actionable lever: a planner or platform can tune transparency -- globally or by segment (a personalized $p_k$) -- to shape equilibrium behavior. From a mechanism design perspective, we derive the \\emph{Escalation Principle}: in games of strategic complements, restricting information can maximize aggregate effort by trapping agents in echo chambers where they compete against hallucinated, high-sophistication peers.

Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \\emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \\emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \\emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \\emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules.

We show that neural retrievers used in RAG systems have blind spots, which we define as the failure to retrieve entities that are relevant to the query, but have low similarity to the query embedding. We investigate the training-induced biases that cause such blind spot entities to be mapped to inaccessible parts of the embedding space, resulting in low retrievability. Using a large-scale dataset constructed from Wikidata relations and first paragraphs of Wikipedia, and our proposed Retrieval Probability Score (RPS), we show that blind spot risk in standard retrievers (e.g., CONTRIEVER, REASONIR) can be predicted pre-index from entity embedding geometry, avoiding expensive retrieval evaluations. To address these blind spots, we introduce ARGUS, a pipeline that enables the retrievability of high-risk (low-RPS) entities through targeted document augmentation from a knowledge base (KB), first paragraphs of Wikipedia, in our case. Extensive experiments on BRIGHT, IMPLIRET, and RAR-B show that ARGUS achieves consistent improvements across all evaluated retrievers (averaging +3.4 nDCG@5 and +4.5 nDCG@10 absolute points), with substantially larger gains in challenging subsets.

Yet some tests suffer from flakiness, where their outcomes vary non-deterministically. Flakiness erodes developer trust in test results, wastes computational resources, and undermines CI reliability. While prior research has examined test flakiness within individual projects, its broader ecosystem-wide impact remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present an empirical study of test flakiness in the OpenStack ecosystem, which focuses on (1) cross-project flakiness, where flaky tests impact multiple projects, and (2) inconsistent flakiness, where a test exhibits flakiness in some projects but remains stable in others. By analyzing 649 OpenStack projects, we identify 1,535 cross-project flaky tests and 1,105 inconsistently flaky tests. We find that cross-project flakiness affects 55% of OpenStack projects and significantly increases both review time and computational costs. Surprisingly, 70% of unit tests exhibit cross-project flakiness, challenging the assumption that unit tests are inherently insulated from issues that span modules like integration and system-level tests. Through qualitative analysis, we observe that race conditions in CI, inconsistent build configurations, and dependency mismatches are the primary causes of inconsistent flakiness. These findings underline the need for better coordination across complex ecosystems, standardized CI configurations, and improved test isolation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9OpenStack\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76OpenStack\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790649\u4e2aOpenStack\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa1535\u4e2a\u8de8\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c1105\u4e2a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cd55%\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5ba1\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c70%\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u8de8\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531CI\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u590d\u6742\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316CI\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9694\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, existing Mamba-based architectures often struggle with datasets characterized by non-stationary patterns. A key observation from time series theory is that the statistical nature of inter-variable relationships differs fundamentally between the trend and seasonal components of a decomposed series. Trend relationships are often driven by a few common stochastic factors or long-run equilibria, suggesting that they reside on a lower-dimensional manifold. In contrast, seasonal relationships involve dynamic, high-dimensional interactions like phase shifts and amplitude co-movements, requiring more expressive modeling. In this paper, we propose DMamba, a novel forecasting model that explicitly aligns architectural complexity with this component-specific characteristic. DMamba employs seasonal-trend decomposition and processes the components with specialized, differentially complex modules: a variable-direction Mamba encoder captures the rich, cross-variable dynamics within the seasonal component, while a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) suffices to learn from the lower-dimensional inter-variable relationships in the trend component. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that DMamba sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), consistently outperforming both recent Mamba-based architectures and leading decomposition-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bDMamba\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b63\u8282\u6027 - \u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6210\u5206\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDMamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b63\u8282\u6027 - \u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u65b9\u5411\u7684Mamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\uff08MLP\uff09\u5904\u7406\u8d8b\u52bf\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMamba\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9886\u5148\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DMamba\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs.

The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT).

A voting rule is allocation proportional if each party's share of elected candidates equals that party's aggregate score.

Yet existing approaches often rely on deterministic latent chains that accumulate noise and overlook the uncertainty inherent in user intent, and they are typically trained in staged pipelines that hinder joint optimization and exploration. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuReason, a unified \"Think-then-Diffuse\" framework for sequential recommendation. It integrates multi-step Thinking Tokens for latent reasoning, diffusion-based refinement for denoising intermediate representations, and end-to-end Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) alignment to optimize for ranking performance. In the Think stage, the model generates Thinking Tokens that reason over user history to form an initial intent hypothesis. In the Diffuse stage, rather than treating this hypothesis as the final output, we refine it through a diffusion process that models user intent as a probabilistic distribution, providing iterative denoising against reasoning noise.

We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development.

However, the complexity beyond normal-form games -- in particular, for extensive-form games (EFGs) -- was a long-standing open problem first highlighted by Miltersen and S\u00f8rensen (SODA '08). In this paper, we resolve this problem by establishing PPAD- and FIXP$_a$-membership (and hence completeness) of normal-form proper equilibria in two-player and multi-player EFGs respectively. Our main ingredient is a technique for computing a perturbed (proper) best response that can be computed efficiently in EFGs. This is despite the fact that, as we show, computing a best response using the classic perturbation of Kohlberg and Mertens based on the permutahedron is #P-hard even in Bayesian games. In stark contrast, we show that computing a proper equilibrium in polytope games is NP-hard. This marks the first natural class in which the complexity of computing equilibrium refinements does not collapse to that of Nash equilibria, and the first problem in which equilibrium computation in polytope games is strictly harder -- unless there is a collapse in the complexity hierarchy -- relative to extensive-form games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b63\u89c4\u5f62\u5f0f\u6070\u5f53\u5747\u8861\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e8c\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u4eba\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u5206\u522b\u662fPPAD\u548cFIXP$_a$\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6070\u5f53\u5747\u8861\u662fNP\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5df2\u77e5\u6b63\u89c4\u5f62\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6070\u5f53\u5747\u8861\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u957f\u671f\u672a\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u6070\u5f53\uff09\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8c\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u4eba\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u5206\u522b\u662fPPAD\u548cFIXP$_a$\u5b8c\u5907\uff1b\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6070\u5f53\u5747\u8861\u662fNP\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5747\u8861\u7cbe\u70bc\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3a\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u535a\u5f08\u5747\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u4e25\u683c\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This heuristic discards the evidential structure of reasoning traces and is brittle under the confabulation consensus, where agents share correlated biases and converge on the same incorrect rationale. We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces.

Specifically, to internalize complex reasoning capabilities into a single efficient model, we first design a multi-agent teacher system capable of multi-turn tool usage and reflection. This teacher utilizes a Collaborative Signal Translation mechanism to explicitly convert latent behavioral patterns into descriptive natural language evidence to enhance reasoning accuracy. Subsequently, a trajectory-driven distillation pipeline transfers this agentic logic, including planning, tool usage, and self-reflection, into the compact STAR model.

Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

Instead, samples transition from semantic ambiguity to class commitment within a narrow regime. Recent theoretical work attributes this transition to dynamical instabilities along class-separating directions, but practical methods to detect and exploit these windows in trained models are still limited. We show that tracking the class-conditional entropy of a latent semantic variable given the noisy state provides a reliable signature of these transition regimes. By restricting the entropy to semantic partitions, the entropy can furthermore resolve semantic decisions at different levels of abstraction. We analyze this behavior in high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and show that the entropy rate concentrates on the same logarithmic time scale as the speciation symmetry-breaking instability previously identified in variance-preserving diffusion. We validate our method on EDM2-XS and Stable Diffusion 1.5, where class-conditional entropy consistently isolates the noise regimes critical for semantic structure formation.

Establishing direct optical paths can reduce congestion and propagation delay, but each reconfiguration incurs non-negligible overhead, making naive per-step reconfiguration impractical.\n  We present Harvest, a systematic approach for synthesizing topology reconfiguration schedules that minimize collective completion time in photonic interconnects. Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the algorithmic structure of a well-known AllReduce algorithm (Recursive Doubling) to synthesize optimal reconfiguration schedules without using any optimizers. By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies. Using packet-level and flow-level evaluations, as well as hardware emulation on commercial GPUs, we show that the schedules synthesized by Harvest significantly reduce collective completion time across multiple collective algorithms compared to static interconnects and reconfigure-every-step baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHarvest\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u7efc\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5149\u5b50\u4e92\u8fde\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u82af\u7247\u5230\u82af\u7247\u7845\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u56e0\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u8def\u4ea4\u6362\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u8fde\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6bcf\u6b65\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u56e0\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7efc\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u5e95\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u52a0\u500d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5408\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "Harvest\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u96c6\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u4e92\u8fde\u548c\u6bcf\u6b65\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "Harvest\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u5b50\u4e92\u8fde\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

However, statistics-based solutions are generally prone to adversarial attacks that contain logic based modifications such as negation in phrases and sentences. In that regard, we present a set of formal reasoning-based methodologies that wrap around existing machine learning toxicity detection systems. Acting as both pre-processing and post-processing steps, our formal reasoning wrapper helps alleviating the negation attack problems and significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of toxicity scoring. We evaluate different variations of our wrapper on multiple machine learning models against a negation adversarial dataset. Experimental results highlight the improvement of hybrid (formal reasoning and machine-learning) methods against various purely statistical solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u5426\u5b9a\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7f51\u7edc\u6b3a\u51cc\u73b0\u8c61\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u529e\u6cd5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u5957\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u524d\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5305\u88c5\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5426\u5b9a\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6bd2\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Traditional QP systems rely on pipelines of isolated discriminative models (e.g., BERT), suffering from limited semantic understanding and high maintenance overhead. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, existing approaches often optimize sub-tasks in isolation, neglecting intrinsic semantic synergy and necessitating independent iterations. Moreover, standard generative methods often lack grounding in SNS scenarios, failing to bridge the gap between open-domain corpora and informal SNS linguistic patterns, while struggling to adhere to rigorous business definitions. We present QP-OneModel, a Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in the SNS domain. We reformulate heterogeneous sub-tasks into a unified sequence generation paradigm, adopting a progressive three-stage alignment strategy culminating in multi-reward Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, QP-OneModel generates intent descriptions as a novel high-fidelity semantic signal, effectively augmenting downstream tasks such as query rewriting and ranking. Offline evaluations show QP-OneModel achieves a 7.35% overall gain over discriminative baselines, with significant F1 boosts in NER (+9.01%) and Term Weighting (+9.31%). It also exhibits superior generalization, surpassing a 32B model by 7.60% accuracy on unseen tasks.

In open-source software (OSS) projects, such links play an important role, particularly between the contributions (e.g., GitHub issues) and the corresponding source code. Through these links, developers can trace the discussions in contributions and uncover design rationales, constraints, and security concerns. Previous studies have mainly examined accepted contributions, while those declined after discussion have been overlooked. The discussions behind declined contributions contain valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge about software decision-making, as the reasons behind the decline often reveal the criteria used to judge what should or should not be implemented. In this study, we present the first attempt to establish traceability links between declined contributions and related source code. We propose an initial linking approach and conduct an empirical analysis of the generated links to discuss factors affecting link generation. As our dataset, we use proposals from the official Go repository, which are GitHub issues used to propose new features or language changes. To link declined proposals to source code, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline. Our results showed that the pipeline selected the correct granularity for each declined proposal with an accuracy of 0.836, and generated correct links at that granularity with a mean precision of 0.643. To clarify the challenges of linking declined proposals, we performed a failure analysis. In the declined proposals where the pipeline failed to generate links, the discussions were often redundant and lacked concrete information (e.g., how the feature should be implemented).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5efa\u7acb\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u88ab\u62d2\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u94fe\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u88ab\u62d2\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u800c\u88ab\u62d2\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u5305\u542b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u7406\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u88ab\u62d2\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u94fe\u63a5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Go\u5b98\u65b9\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u63d0\u6848\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u6765\u94fe\u63a5\u88ab\u62d2\u63d0\u6848\u548c\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ba1\u9053\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u88ab\u62d2\u63d0\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.836\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e3a0.643\u3002\u5728\u7ba1\u9053\u672a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u88ab\u62d2\u63d0\u6848\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u5f80\u5f80\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5177\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u7acb\u88ab\u62d2\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u94fe\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u94fe\u63a5\u88ab\u62d2\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, in the initial retrieval stage, practitioners face an inherent tradeoff between embedding expressiveness and the scalability and latency of serving components, resulting in the need for representations that are both compact and expressive. To address this challenge, we propose a training strategy for learning high-dimensional sparse embedding layers in place of conventional dense ones, balancing efficiency, representational expressiveness, and interpretability. To demonstrate our approach, we modified the production-grade collaborative filtering autoencoder ELSA, achieving up to 10x reduction in embedding size with no loss of recommendation accuracy, and up to 100x reduction with only a 2.5% loss. Moreover, the active embedding dimensions reveal an interpretable inverted-index structure that segments items in a way directly aligned with the model's latent space, thereby enabling integration of segment-level recommendation functionality (e.g., 2D homepage layouts) within the candidate retrieval model itself.

Leveraging bounded-expectation reformulations of CVaR compatible with quantum amplitude estimation, we develop a quantum-enhanced inference framework that casts CVaR evaluation as a statistically consistent, confidence-constrained maximum-likelihood amplitude estimation problem. The proposed method extends iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE) by embedding explicit maximum-likelihood inference within a rigorously controlled interval-tracking architecture. To ensure global correctness under finite-shot noise and the non-injective oscillatory response induced by Grover amplification, we introduce a stabilized inference scheme incorporating multi-hypothesis feasibility tracking, periodic low-depth disambiguation, and a bounded restart mechanism governed by an explicit failure-probability budget. This formulation preserves the quadratic oracle-complexity advantage of amplitude estimation while providing finite-sample confidence guarantees and reduced estimator variance. The framework is demonstrated on benchmark problems with spatially correlated lognormal Young's modulus fields generated using a Nystrom low-rank Gaussian kernel model. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves substantially lower oracle complexity than classical Monte Carlo CVaR estimation at comparable confidence levels, while maintaining rigorous statistical reliability.

Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684Rashomon\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Rashomon\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u5b9a\u4e49\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9Rashomon\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06Rashomon\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u79cd\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6Rashomon\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u90fd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6Rashomon\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks.

Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software. SpinCastML reduces experimental waste, accelerates discovery, and democratizes access to advanced modeling, establishing distribution aware inverse design as a new standard for sustainable nanofiber manufacturing across biomedical, filtration, and energy applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6SpinCastML\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9759\u7535\u7eba\u4e1d\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ea4\u7ef4\u76f4\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5236\u9020\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6574\u5408\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6eb6\u5242\u5316\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6240\u9700\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6574\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u300111\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Cubist\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5e73\u8861Sobol D\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Inverse Monte Carlo\uff08IMC\uff09\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "Cubist\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff08R2 > 0.92\uff09\uff0cIMC\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\uff08R2 > 0.90\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee < 1%\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "SpinCastML\u5c06\u9759\u7535\u7eba\u4e1d\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u4e3a\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5236\u9020\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty.

Scaling such data has been limited by the complexity of environment setup, unit test generation, and problem statement curation. In this paper, we propose ScaleSWE, an automated, sandboxed multi agent workflow designed to construct high quality SWE data at scale. The system coordinates three specialized agents for environment setup, test creation, and problem description synthesis to process 6 million pull requests across 5200 repositories, producing Scale SWE Data: 100k verified SWE instances, the largest such dataset to date. It substantially surpasses existing real world datasets in repository diversity and reflects realistic task complexity. We further demonstrate the dataset utility for training by distilling 71498 high quality trajectories and finetuning Qwen30BA3BInstruct to produce ScaleSWE Agent.

This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \\emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \\emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare. We further show that this scaling is tight in a weak-screening limit, and that in the sparse-verification regime ($B \\ll K$), substantial leverage requires heavy-tailed score distributions; for light-tailed scores the amplification is only logarithmic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u63a8\u7406\uff08ACI\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f97\u51faJaKoB\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6269\u5927\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7b5b\u9009\u53ef\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u653e\u5927\u7a00\u7f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7aef\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u516c\u5171\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u540e\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u63a8\u7406\uff08ACI\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u6bcf\u7a97\u53e3\u540e\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5373\u8ba4\u77e5\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51faJaKoB\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6709\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u9879\u548c\u4e0e\u221a(JKB)\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6760\u6746\u9879\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u5f31\u7b5b\u9009\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u662f\u7d27\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u8f7b\u5c3e\u5206\u6570\u653e\u5927\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5927\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7b5b\u9009\u53ef\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u653e\u5927\u7a00\u7f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4fe1\u606f\u8bb0\u5f55\u5f88\u5c11\u3002"}}

We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training. Second, we evaluate the fairness of models trained with and without a given feature. This occlusion-based score enjoys dramatic computational simplification via minipatch learning.

However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions.

In the past three years, KOA has begun a modernization program to replace the architecture and systems used since the archive's creation with a new modern Python-based infrastructure. This infrastructure will position KOA to respond to the rapid growth of new and complex data sets that will be acquired by new instruments now in development, and enable follow-up to identify the deluge of alerts of transient sources expected by new survey telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Since 2022, KOA has ingested new data in near-real time, generally within one minute of creation, and has made them immediately accessible to observers through a dedicated web interface. The archive is now deploying a new, scalable, Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure built with the Plotly-Dash framework and R-tree indices to speed-up queries by a factor of 20.\n  The project described here exploits the new query infrastructure to develop a dashboard that will return live metrics on the performance and growth of the archive. These metrics assess the current health of the archive and guide planning future hardware and software upgrades. This single dashboard will enable, for example, monitoring of real-time ingestion, as well as studying the long-term growth of the archive.

For tree ensembles, predictions are piecewise constant over a large collection of axis-aligned hyperrectangles, implying that an optimal counterfactual for a point corresponds to its projection onto the nearest rectangle with an alternative label under a chosen metric. Existing methods largely overlook this geometric structure, relying either on heuristics with no optimality guarantees or on mixed-integer programming formulations that do not scale to interactive use.\n  In this work, we revisit counterfactual generation through the lens of nearest-region search and introduce counterfactual maps, a global representation of recourse for tree ensembles. Leveraging the fact that any tree ensemble can be compressed into an equivalent partition of labeled hyperrectangles, we cast counterfactual search as the problem of identifying the generalized Voronoi cell associated with the nearest rectangle of an alternative label. This leads to an exact, amortized algorithm based on volumetric k-dimensional (KD) trees, which performs branch-and-bound nearest-region queries with explicit optimality certificates and sublinear average query time after a one-time preprocessing phase.\n  Our experimental analyses on several real datasets drawn from high-stakes application domains show that this approach delivers globally optimal counterfactual explanations with millisecond-level latency, achieving query times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing exact, cold-start optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eKD\u6811\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49Voronoi\u5355\u5143\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eKD\u6811\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u3001\u644a\u9500\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Such a model allows the design have an arbitrary distribution of singular values and only assumes that its singular vectors are generic. It is a vast generalization of the i.i.d. Gaussian design typically considered in the theoretical literature, and is motivated by the fact that real data often have a complex correlation structure so that methods relying on i.i.d. assumptions can be highly suboptimal. Building on the paradigm of spectrally-initialized iterative optimization, this paper proposes optimal spectral estimators and combines them with an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, establishing rigorous performance guarantees for these two algorithmic steps. Both the spectral initialization and the subsequent AMP meet existing conjectures on the fundamental limits to estimation -- the former on the optimal sample complexity for efficient weak recovery, and the latter on the optimal errors.

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets.

Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6UniComp\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UniComp\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UniComp\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes.

Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $\u03bc$ and the feedback length $\u03bc$'.

Our findings reveal three key insights. First, in text retrieval, output (document) magnitude strongly correlates with relevance (Cohen's $d$ up to 1.80), yielding the largest gains on reasoning-intensive tasks. Second, input and output magnitudes serve asymmetric roles: output magnitude directly scales similarity scores while input magnitude modulates training dynamics. Third, magnitude learning benefits asymmetric tasks (text retrieval, RAG) but harms symmetric tasks (STS, text-image alignment).

This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions). Motivated by this, we introduce a simple normalization method to mitigate the effect of domain shift on geometric statistics, leading to AUROC gains of +34 points in multi-domain settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6355\u83b7\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u83b7\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u963b\u788d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e14\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u503c\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u5176\u6355\u6349\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6355\u83b7\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f7fAUROC\u63d0\u534734\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters.

Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

However, while research on automated code migration which including refactoring, API adaptation, and dependency updates has advanced rapidly, the exploration of the automated environment interaction that must accompany it remains relatively scarce. In practice, code and its environment are intricately intertwined. Relying solely on static analysis of the environment leads to an inadequate understanding of the target setting, prolongs feedback cycles, and consequently causes significant rework and project delays, thereby reducing overall efficiency. We contend that successful software evolution demands a holistic perspective that integrates both code and environment migration. To understand the current landscape and challenges, we first provide an overview of the status of automated environment construction.

In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values.

Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

However, the current manual process is labor-intensive, and hence, done only as a one-time assessment for a subset of all papers. To support the artifact evaluation effort, we present Artisan, an automated LLM agent for reproducing research results given a paper and its artifact. The approach is enabled by two key contributions: First, we frame the reproduction problem as a code generation task where the goal is to generate a reproduction script that, when executed, reproduces the results reported in a paper. Unlike prior work on automatically reproducing research results in other domains, this formulation allows for running the script independently of the agent and for assessing the reproduction process at a fine-grained level. Second, we design automated judging mechanism that guides the agent toward the expected results without revealing them and that prevent trivial solutions, such as simply copying checked-in results. To evaluate Artisan, we introduce Artisan-Bench, the first benchmark assessing the ability to generate reproduction scripts and the first benchmark for automated artifact evaluation in software engineering. Artisan-Bench comprises 60 tasks derived from 23 software engineering papers, covering different research areas and programming languages.

Despite substantial progress, a significant gap remains between existing convergence rates and the state-of-the-art bounds known for federated convex optimization. In this work, we address this limitation by establishing a series of improved convergence rates. First, we show that, for general smooth and monotone variational inequalities, the classical Local Extra SGD algorithm admits tighter guarantees under a refined analysis. Next, we identify an inherent limitation of Local Extra SGD, which can lead to excessive client drift. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new algorithm, the Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX), and show that it mitigates client drift and achieves improved guarantees in several regimes, including bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance settings.

Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts.

In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings.

A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge.

Although methods like low-rank adapters help address these challenges by adding small trainable modules to the frozen LM, they also increase memory usage and do not reduce inference latency. We uncover an intriguing phenomenon: sparsifying specific model rows and columns enables efficient task adaptation without requiring weight tuning. We propose a scheme for effective finetuning via sparsification using training stochastic gates, which requires minimal trainable parameters, reduces inference time, and removes 20--40\\% of model parameters without significant accuracy loss. Empirical results show it outperforms recent finetuning baselines in efficiency and performance.

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGHS - TDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u51b3\u7b56\u654f\u611f\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "GHS - TDA\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u5019\u9009\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u518d\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u67b6\u3002", "result": "GHS - TDA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "GHS - TDA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The retrieval-ranking dataset contains 1,091 manually verified query-positive-negative document triplets drawn from diverse Amharic sources and constructed to support contrastive training and benchmarking of neural retrievers (e.g., DPR, ColBERT-style late interaction and SPLADE-style sparse neural retrieval). Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers. The instruction prompt-response dataset comprises 6,285 Amharic prompt-response pairs spanning multiple domains and instruction types, generated with several LLMs and refined through manual review and correction for grammaticality, relevance, fluency, and factual plausibility. We release both datasets with standardized splits and formats (CSV,JSON,JSONL) to enable reproducible work on Amharic retrieval, ranking, and generative modelling.

Guided by this decomposition, we construct a family of spectral algorithms based on harmonic tensor unfolding that sequentially recover the latent directions and (nearly) achieve these SQ and LDP lower bounds.

The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans.

In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff08SPP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u6709\u4e2d\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6548\u679c\uff08ICEs\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\u7684SPP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u6709ICEs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SPP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709ICEs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u9047\u5230\u65e0\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u65e0ICEs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u4e2d\uff0cPatty\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1b\u5728\u6709ICEs\u7684\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u641c\u7d22\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u80dc\u8fc7\u8be5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u6269\u5c55\u7684SPP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5177\u6709ICEs\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Our empirical analysis proves that each one of these tasks requires just an appropriate weighting schema for the W2BGP, while the entire framework remains untouched. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most well-known BO acquisition functions can be easily re-interpreted under the proposed framework and also enable a more computationally efficient way to deal with the computation of the Wasserstein Barycenter, compared with state-of-the-art methods from the Machine Learning literature.

Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.\n  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set.

We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks.

We provide simple theoretical intuition for why gradient information can help distinguish inputs and improve the approximation of functions with rapidly varying behaviour. On a synthetic regression task with a high-frequency sinusoidal ground truth, we show that conventional residual connections struggle to capture high-frequency patterns.

In contrast to the empirical success of self-improvement, the theoretical foundation of this generative, iterative procedure in a practical, finite-sample setting remains limited. We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks.

Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments.

To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions.

In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation. This novel architecture combines the strengths of DCNv2 and MaskNet, scales efficiently with increased compute, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on a large internal Pinterest ads dataset show that ML-DCN achieves higher AUC than DCNv2, MaskNet, and recent scaling-oriented alternatives at matched FLOPs, and it scales more favorably overall as compute increases, exhibiting a stronger AUC-FLOPs trade-off. Finally, online A/B tests demonstrate statistically significant improvements in key ads metrics (including CTR and click-quality measures) and ML-DCN has been deployed in the production system with neutral serving cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u65e2\u5b9a\u670d\u52a1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408DCNv2\u548cMaskNet\u4f18\u52bf\u7684ML - DCN\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5df2\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e7f\u544a\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5e0c\u671b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Pinterest\u5e7f\u544a\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u79bb\u7ebf\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faML - DCN\uff0c\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6761\u4ef6\u63a9\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4f4e\u79e9\u4ea4\u53c9\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7a81\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728Pinterest\u5185\u90e8\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cML - DCN\u5728\u76f8\u540cFLOPs\u4e0bAUC\u9ad8\u4e8eDCNv2\u3001MaskNet\u7b49\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6574\u4f53\u6269\u5c55\u66f4\u6709\u5229\uff1b\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5173\u952e\u5e7f\u544a\u6307\u6807\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u4e2d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ML - DCN\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86DCNv2\u548cMaskNet\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u65e2\u5b9a\u670d\u52a1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e7f\u544a\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While existing methods in the offline setting handle any selection mechanism that is permutation invariant to the labeled data, their extension to the online setting -- where data arrives sequentially and later decisions depend on earlier ones -- is challenged by the fact that the selection mechanism is naturally asymmetric. As such, existing methods only address a limited collection of selection mechanisms.\n  In this paper, we propose PErmutation-based Mondrian Conformal Inference (PEMI), a general permutation-based framework for selective conformal prediction with arbitrary asymmetric selection rules. Motivated by full and Mondrian conformal prediction, PEMI identifies all permutations of the observed data (or a Monte-Carlo subset thereof) that lead to the same selection event, and calibrates a prediction set using conformity scores over this selection-preserving reference set. Under standard exchangeability conditions, our prediction sets achieve finite-sample exact selection-conditional coverage for any asymmetric selection mechanism and any prediction model. PEMI naturally incorporates additional offline labeled data, extends to selection mechanisms with multiple test samples, and achieves FCR control with fine-grained selection taxonomies. We further work out several efficient instantiations for commonly-used online selection rules, including covariate-based rules, conformal p/e-values-based procedures, and selection based on earlier outcomes.

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points.

Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach.

In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements.

Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time.

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems.

We introduce a barycentric alignment framework that quotients out these nuisance symmetries to construct a universal embedding space across many models. Unlike existing similarity measures, which summarize relationships over entire stimulus sets, this framework enables similarity to be defined at the level of individual stimuli, revealing inputs that elicit convergent versus divergent representations across models. Using this instance-level notion of similarity, we identify systematic input properties that predict representational convergence versus divergence across vision and language model families. We also construct universal embedding spaces for brain representations across individuals and cortical regions, enabling instance-level comparison of representational agreement across stages of the human visual hierarchy. Finally, we apply the same barycentric alignment framework to purely unimodal vision and language models and find that post-hoc alignment into a shared space yields image text similarity scores that closely track human cross-modal judgments and approach the performance of contrastively trained vision-language models. This strikingly suggests that independently learned representations already share sufficient geometric structure for human-aligned cross-modal comparison.

When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions.

We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data.

Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification.

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \\geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \\leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models.

Many existing methods conflate these observation artifacts with genuine neural influence, risking spurious causal graphs driven by the measurement process. We introduce INCAMA (INdirect CAusal MAmba), a latent-space causal discovery framework that explicitly accounts for measurement physics to separate neural dynamics from indirect observations. INCAMA integrates a physics-aware inversion module with a nonstationarity-driven, delay-sensitive causal discovery model based on selective state-space sequences. Leveraging nonstationary mechanism shifts as soft interventions, we establish identifiability of delayed causal structure from indirect measurements and a stability bound that quantifies how inversion error affects graph recovery. We validate INCAMA on large-scale biophysical simulations across EEG and fMRI, where it significantly outperforms standard pipelines. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to real-world fMRI from the Human Connectome Project: without domain-specific fine-tuning, INCAMA recovers canonical visuo-motor pathways (e.g., $V1 \\to V2$ and $M1 \\leftrightarrow S1$) consistent with established neuroanatomy, supporting its use for whole-brain causal inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faINCAMA\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u5411\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6d4b\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u54cd\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u5047\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165INCAMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u53cd\u6f14\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u79fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9efMRI\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5178\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8fd0\u52a8\u901a\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "INCAMA\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u8111\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate.

This approach facilitates efficient EEG signal processing on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u75282D - CNN\u66ff\u4ee31D - CNN\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Edge TPU\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6784\u5efaE2CAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5904\u7406EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08EEG\uff09\u4f2a\u8ff9\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff082D - CNN\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e00\u7ef4\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff081D - CNN\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u5728Edge TPU\u4e0a\uff0c\u6784\u5efaE2CAR\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728TPU\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1190%\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e18.98%\uff0c\u4f2a\u8ff9\u53bb\u9664\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures.

To investigate our conjecture, we first show that incorporating the Laplacian mechanism into transformers induces consistent improvements across benchmarks in computer vision and language. Next, we study how the Laplacian mechanism impacts the geometry of token representations using various tools: 1) principal component analysis, 2) cosine similarity metric, 3) analysis of variance, and 4) Neural Collapse metrics. Our investigation shows that the Laplacian mechanism reshapes token embeddings toward a geometry of maximal separability: tokens collapse according to their classes, and the class means exhibit Neural Collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6539\u4e3a\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4f7f\u4ee4\u724c\u5d4c\u5165\u66f4\u6613\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9Transformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165Transformer\uff0c\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5d29\u6e83\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4ee4\u724c\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ee4\u724c\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u6309\u7c7b\u522b\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u7c7b\u5747\u503c\u5448\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eTransformer\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7f\u4ee4\u724c\u8868\u793a\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Although distillation is widely used to reduce the number of inference steps, existing methods often suffer from process variance due to endpoint error accumulation. Moreover, directly reusing continuous-time architectures for discrete, fixed-step generation introduces structural parameter inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce DSFlow, a modular distillation framework for few-step and one-step synthesis. DSFlow reformulates generation as a discrete prediction task and explicitly adapts the student model to the target inference regime. It improves training stability through a dual supervision strategy that combines endpoint matching with deterministic mean-velocity alignment, enforcing consistent generation trajectories across inference steps. In addition, DSFlow improves parameter efficiency by replacing continuous-time timestep conditioning with lightweight step-aware tokens, aligning model capacity with the significantly reduced timestep space of the discrete task. Extensive experiments across diverse flow-based text-to-speech architectures demonstrate that DSFlow consistently outperforms standard distillation approaches, achieving strong few-step and one-step synthesis quality while reducing model parameters and inference cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDSFlow\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DSFlow\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6b65\u957f\u611f\u77e5\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDSFlow\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c11\u6b65\u548c\u4e00\u6b65\u5408\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "DSFlow\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

West", "YangQuan Chen"], "title": "Statistical Roughness-Informed Machine Unlearning", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of a designated forget set from a trained model while preserving utility on the retained data. In modern deep networks, approximate unlearning frequently fails under large or adversarial deletions due to pronounced layer-wise heterogeneity: some layers exhibit stable, well-regularized representations while others are brittle, undertrained, or overfit, so naive update allocation can trigger catastrophic forgetting or unstable dynamics. We propose Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a mechanism-first unlearning algorithm that reallocates unlearning updates using layer-wise statistical roughness operationalized via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics of layer weight matrices. Starting from an Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) sensitivity signal computed on the forget set, SRAGU estimates a WeightWatcher-style heavy-tailed exponent for each layer, maps it to a bounded spectral stability weight, and uses this stability signal to spectrally reweight the AGU sensitivities before applying the same minibatch update form. This concentrates unlearning motion in spectrally stable layers while damping updates in unstable or overfit layers, improving stability under hard deletions. We evaluate unlearning via behavioral alignment to a gold retrained reference model trained from scratch on the retained data, using empirical prediction-divergence and KL-to-gold proxies on a forget-focused query set; we additionally report membership inference auditing as a complementary leakage signal, treating forget-set points as should-be-forgotten members during evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSRAGU\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u786c\u5220\u9664\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5220\u9664\u65f6\u56e0\u5c42\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u6734\u7d20\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRAGU\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u5c3e\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u3001KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "SRAGU\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c42\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5c42\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u786c\u5220\u9664\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SRAGU\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u786c\u5220\u9664\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design. Despite its importance, the relationship between reward modeling and core LLM challenges--such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning--remains poorly understood. This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRFID - MoE\u6846\u67b6\u538b\u7f29MoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8def\u7531\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "MoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u50a8\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u73b0\u6709SVD\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u8def\u7531\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u7684\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u79e9\uff0c\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u91cd\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRFID - MoE\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eMoBE\u548cD2 - MoE\uff0c\u5982\u5728Qwen3 - 30B\u6a21\u578b60%\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4f7fPTB\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u964d\u81f316.92\uff0cHellaSwag\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea68%\u3002", "conclusion": "RFID - MoE\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684MoE\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose Priority-Aware Shapley Value (PASV), which incorporates both hard precedence constraints and soft, contributor-specific priority weights. PASV is applicable to general precedence structures, recovers precedence-only and weight-only Shapley variants as special cases, and is uniquely characterized by natural axioms. We develop an efficient adjacent-swap Metropolis-Hastings sampler for scalable Monte Carlo estimation and analyze limiting regimes induced by extreme priority weights.

Uniquely, we repurpose frozen Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as continuous affective sensors, distilling high-dimensional visual streams into dense, narrative-aware Valence-Arousal trajectories.

This minimalist design bypasses the bottlenecks of dense attention and architectural cloning, effectively mitigating the overfitting risks associated with data scarcity.

To appear in Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '26)", "summary": "The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u805a\u7126\u4f4f\u9662\u671f\u95f4\u4e2d\u98ce\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e2d\u98ce\u524dPPG\u6ce2\u5f62\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u98ce\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u98ce\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9662\u524d\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e2d\u98ce\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cPPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\u672a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u805a\u7126\u4f4f\u9662\u671f\u95f4\u4e2d\u98ce\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u98ce\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ecePPG\u63d0\u53d6\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528ResNet - 1D\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u98ce\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728MIMIC - III\u548cMC - MED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5305\u542b\u4e2d\u98ce\u53d1\u4f5c\u524d\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u88ab\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a4\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165LLMRule\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5165\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u9884\u7b97\uff08PB\uff09\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7528\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684PB\u89c4\u5219\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u6e10\u5e7f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LLMRule\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7eb3\u5165\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1PB\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85600\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645PB\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u4e00\u822c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMRule\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1PB\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6548\u7528\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \\#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\\%, 22\\% and 21\\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSL - SAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6280\u672f\u5230\u5c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3SAM\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u989d\u5916\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f7f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u6839\u636e\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u91c7\u6837\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u53c2\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSL - SAM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u666e\u901aSAM\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SL - SAM\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines.

In these fields, the goal is to generate various samples with high rewards (e.g., drug-likeness in molecules), making reward-based guidance crucial. Most existing methods are based on guiding the diffusion model using intermediate rewards but tend to underperform since intermediate rewards are noisy due to the non-smooth nature of reward functions used in scientific domains. To address this, we propose Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler, a method that performs effective test-time reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling local search without relying on intermediate rewards. CSMC constructs a Markov chain of clean samples using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm such that its stationary distribution is the target distribution.

Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions.

Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\\!-\\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\\!-\\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6545\u969c\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cdN - k\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53ca\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f7f\u9ad8\u9636N - k\u6545\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u6b63\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6545\u969c\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u79bb\u7ebf\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6545\u969c\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002"}}

Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift.

Moreover, if focusing on projection-free algorithms, which can efficiently handle complex decision sets, they cannot even recover the approximate regret bounds achieved in the centralized setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for D-OCSM over general convex decision sets, these two issues can be addressed simultaneously. Furthermore, for D-OCSM over downward-closed decision sets, we show that the second issue can be addressed while significantly alleviating the first issue. Our key techniques are two reductions from D-OCSM to decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), which can exploit D-OCO algorithms to improve the approximate regret of D-OCSM in these two cases, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5728\u7ebf\u8fde\u7eed\u5b50\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08D - OCSM\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u4eceD - OCSM\u5230\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\uff08D - OCO\uff09\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\u754c\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524dD - OCSM\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\u754c\u4e0e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6295\u5f71\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u5927\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4eceD - OCSM\u5230D - OCO\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528D - OCO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbD - OCSM\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684D - OCSM\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5411\u4e0b\u5c01\u95ed\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684D - OCSM\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7ea6\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdbD - OCSM\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This article interrogates how AI-driven targeting systems function as epistemic infrastructures that classify, legitimize, and execute violence, using Israel's conduct in Gaza as a paradigmatic case. Through the lens of responsibility, the article examines three interrelated dimensions: (a) political responsibility, exploring how states exploit AI to accelerate warfare while evading accountability; (b) professional responsibility, addressing the complicity of technologists, engineers, and defense contractors in the weaponization of data; and (c) personal responsibility, probing the moral agency of individuals who participate in or resist algorithmic governance. This is complemented by an examination of the position and influence of those participating in public discourse, whose narratives often obscure or normalize AI-enabled violence. The Gaza case reveals AI not as a neutral instrument but as an active participant in the reproduction of colonial hierarchies and the normalization of atrocity. Ultimately, the paper calls for a reframing of technological agency and accountability in the age of automated warfare.

Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global H\u00f6lder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities.

However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes.

While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions.

Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines.

Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations.

A core challenge is to build a scalable long-horizon memory that supports an agentic workflow for planning, retrieval, and reasoning over open-ended instructions at variable granularity, while producing precise, actionable answers for navigation. We present STaR, an agentic reasoning framework that (i) constructs a task-agnostic, multimodal long-term memory that generalizes to unseen queries while preserving fine-grained environmental semantics (object attributes, spatial relations, and dynamic events), and (ii) introduces a Scalable TaskConditioned Retrieval algorithm based on the Information Bottleneck principle to extract from long-term memory a compact, non-redundant, information-rich set of candidate memories for contextual reasoning. We evaluate STaR on NaVQA (mixed indoor/outdoor campus scenes) and WH-VQA, a customized warehouse benchmark with many visually similar objects built with Isaac Sim, emphasizing contextual reasoning. Across the two datasets, STaR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher success rates and markedly lower spatial error. We further deploy STaR on a real Husky wheeled robot in both indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating robust longhorizon reasoning, scalability, and practical utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6STaR\uff0c\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u5019\u9009\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bfc\u822a\u53ef\u7528\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTaR\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u5019\u9009\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728NaVQA\u548cWH - VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSTaR\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eHusky\u8f6e\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "STaR\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication.

While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability.

We demonstrate that, unlike in the image domain where deep generative models frequently assign higher likelihoods to anomalous data, such counterintuitive behavior occurs far less often in tabular settings. We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data.

Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data.

While scientific machine learning offers powerful nonlinear modeling tools, the control-oriented implications of different differentiable paradigms remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Differentiable Programming (DP) for modeling, identification, and control of power system dynamics. Using the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system as a benchmark, we evaluate their performance in trajectory extrapolation, parameter estimation, and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis.\n  Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between data-driven flexibility and physical structure. NODE exhibits superior extrapolation by capturing the underlying vector field, whereas PINN shows limited generalization due to its reliance on a time-dependent solution map. In the inverse problem of parameter identification, while both DP and PINN successfully recover the unknown parameters, DP achieves significantly faster convergence by enforcing governing equations as hard constraints. Most importantly, for control synthesis, the DP framework yields closed-loop stability comparable to the theoretical optimum.

Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution.

Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51faMonoSoup\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0ID - OOD\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u662f\u591a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u63d0\u5347ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4eOOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u6743\u8861\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u548cQwen\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMonoSoup\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u591a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MonoSoup\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Anomaly detection in UTS plays an essential role in both data mining and system reliability management. However, existing reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods struggle to capture certain subtle anomalies, particularly small point anomalies and slowly rising anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization.

The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image.

A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7GNN\u67b6\u6784BRAVA - GNN\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u76f8\u5bf9\u4ecb\u6570\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u76f4\u5f84\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ecb\u6570\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u8df3\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572819\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cBRAVA - GNN\u5728Kendall - Tau\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u5347214%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u52a0\u901f70\u500d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "BRAVA - GNN\u80fd\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u65cf\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u6700\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u6709GNN\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c1154\u500d\u3002"}}

We present a systematic characterization of OS-level resource dynamics in sandboxed AI coding agents, analyzing 144 software engineering tasks from the SWE-rebench benchmark across two LLM models. Our measurements reveal that (1) OS-level execution (tool calls, container and agent initialization) accounts for 56-74% of end-to-end task latency; (2) memory, not CPU, is the concurrency bottleneck; (3) memory spikes are tool-call-driven with a up to 15.4x peak-to-average ratio; and (4) resource demands are highly unpredictable across tasks, runs, and models. Comparing these characteristics against serverless, microservice, and batch workloads, we identify three mismatches in existing resource controls: a granularity mismatch (container-level policies vs. tool-call-level dynamics), a responsiveness mismatch (user-space reaction vs. sub-second unpredictable bursts), and an adaptability mismatch (history-based prediction vs. non-deterministic stateful execution). We propose AgentCgroup , an eBPF-based resource controller that addresses these mismatches through hierarchical cgroup structures aligned with tool-call boundaries, in-kernel enforcement via sched_ext and memcg_bpf_ops, and runtime-adaptive policies driven by in-kernel monitoring.

As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO).

While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment.

Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u9ad8\u9636\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08QAOA\uff09\u517c\u5bb9\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u6548\u7528\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6602\u8d35\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u9ad8\u9636\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e0eQAOA\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u72ec\u5bb6\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7ea6\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e8c\u6b21\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u9ed1\u7bb1\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay.

We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace.

However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting.

However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \\k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \\k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \\k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model).

Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLARV\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u5e76\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5927\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5c42\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u5c42\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684LARV\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u6bcf\u5c42\u5206\u914d\u7f29\u653e\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728FusionBench\u4e0a\uff0cLARV\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5982Iso - C + LARV\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LARV\u6291\u5236\u6d45\u5c42\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u653e\u5927\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6210\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86DDQN\u548cDueling DQN\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DDQN\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u800cDueling DQN\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u67b6\u6784\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0e\u503c\u57fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5CartPole\u4e3a\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u3001LunarLander\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u8fc1\u79fb\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "DDQN\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1bDueling DQN\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u964d\u4f4e\u4e14\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u591a\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0e\u503c\u57fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

In response, we revisit Design-by-Analogy (DbA), a cognitively grounded approach that fosters novel solutions by mapping inspiration across domains.

Such conceptual limitations inadvertently foster widespread design fixation. To address this, we expand the understanding of DbA by embedding it into the entire creative process, thereby demonstrating its capacity to mitigate such fixation. Through a systematic review of 85 studies, we identify six forms of representation and classify techniques across seven stages of the creative process. We further discuss three major application domains: creative industries, intelligent manufacturing, and education and services, demonstrating DbA's practical relevance.

However, the high deployment cost hinders their scalability. To tackle the issues, Spatial Interpolation (SI) introduces virtual sensors to infer readings from observed sensors, leveraging graph structure. However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch.

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u79d1\u5b66\u590d\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fVLA\u63a8\u7406\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e14\u53ef\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u591a\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u590d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u539f\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8fc7\u6e21\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8fc7\u6e21\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u6e21\u673a\u5668\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u8fc7\u6e21\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u6bcf\u6b21\u539f\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad842%\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u8f7b\u677e\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d2\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps.

This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary.

While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial.\n  In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors.

We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain.

Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT.

Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise.

This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones.

Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations.

We explore the reverse: crafting training data that induces model behavior. Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned.

We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs.

To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \\textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \\textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework.

That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MPNNs\uff09\u548c\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5212\u5206\u662f\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u8005\u662f\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0a\u6392\u5217\u7b49\u53d8\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u4f18\u52bf\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5e94\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u4fc3\u8fdb\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dMPNNs\u548c\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5212\u5206\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06MPNNs\u548c\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0a\u6392\u5217\u7b49\u53d8\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8bb8\u591a\u6d41\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7b49\u6548\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e8c\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2dFMQA\u4e0e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08bAE\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793abAE\u4f18\u52bf\u53ca\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cFMQA\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u4e8c\u6b21\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u975e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14bAE\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u5c0f\u578b\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4bAE\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "bAE\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4f7f\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u90bb\u57df\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86bAE+FMQA\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u5e76\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks.

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality.

To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model.

Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality).

Two main forms are recognized: type 1 diabetes (T1D), which involves autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing \\b{eta}-cells, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which arises from insulin resistance and progressive \\b{eta}-cell dysfunction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases is essential for the development of improved therapeutic strategies, particularly those targeting \\b{eta}-cell dysfunction. To investigate these mechanisms in a controlled and biologically interpretable setting, mouse models have played a central role in diabetes research. Owing to their genetic and physiological similarity to humans, together with the ability to precisely manipulate their genome, mice enable detailed investigation of disease progression and gene function. In particular, mouse models have provided critical insights into \\b{eta}-cell development, cellular heterogeneity, and functional failure under diabetic conditions. Building on these experimental advances, this study applies machine learning methods to single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse pancreatic islets.

However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation.

Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation.

While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}.\n  To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.\n  Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.\n  Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability.

In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference. Our results highlight that careful orchestration of multiple reasoning pathways yields scalable and reliable TableQA.

The law's response--substituting procedural review for substantive oversight--has produced a sedimentary accretion of requirements that ossify capacity without ensuring democratic control. This Article argues that the Supreme Court's post-Loper Bright retrenchment is best understood as an effort to shrink administration back to comprehensible size in response to this complexification. But reducing complexity in this way sacrifices capability precisely when climate change, pandemics, and AI risks demand more sophisticated governance.\n  AI offers a different path. Unlike many prior administrative technologies that increased opacity alongside capacity, AI can help build \"scrutability\" in government, translating technical complexity into accessible terms, surfacing the assumptions that matter for oversight, and enabling substantive verification of agency reasoning. This Article proposes three doctrinal innovations within administrative law to realize this potential: a Model and System Dossier (documenting model purpose, evaluation, monitoring, and versioning) extending the administrative record to AI decision-making; a material-model-change trigger specifying when AI updates require new process; and a \"deference to audit\" standard that rewards agencies for auditable evaluation of their AI tools.

Here we tackle this challenge by directly solving the many-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation with neural-network variational Monte Carlo, which provides a highly expressive variational wavefunction for strongly correlated systems. Applying this technique to transition metal dichalcogenide moir\u00e9 semicondutors, we predict itinerant ferromagnetism in WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ and an antiferromagnetic insulator in twisted $\u0393$-valley homobilayer, using the same neural network without any physics input beyond the microscopic Hamiltonian.

Identifying which low-risk patients are at higher risk of progression is a critical unmet need for tailored surveillance and preventative therapeutic strategies.

Most machine learning frameworks use pseudorandom number generators as the source of randomness. However, variations in design choices and implementations across different frameworks, software dependencies, and hardware backends along with the lack of statistical validation can lead to previously unexplored attack vectors on machine learning systems. Such attacks on randomness sources can be extremely covert, and have a history of exploitation in real-world systems. In this work, we examine the role of randomness in the machine learning development pipeline from an adversarial point of view, and analyze the implementations of PRNGs in major machine learning frameworks. We present RNGGuard to help machine learning engineers secure their systems with low effort. RNGGuard statically analyzes a target library's source code and identifies instances of random functions and modules that use them. At runtime, RNGGuard enforces secure execution of random functions by replacing insecure function calls with RNGGuard's implementations that meet security specifications.

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $\u03c1=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale).

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization.

RADII provides frontier-specific diagnostics: per-radius error profiles pinpoint each architecture's scaling ceiling, surface-interior decomposition tests whether failures originate at boundaries or in bulk, and cross-metric failure sequencing reveals which aspect of structural fidelity breaks first.

This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\\%) and ERM (21.5\\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping.

A Global Timbre Memory expands a global timbre instance into multiple compact facets; frame-level content attends to this memory, a gate regulates variation, and spherical interpolation preserves identity geometry while enabling smooth local changes. In addition, a factorized vector-quantized bottleneck regularizes content to reduce residual speaker leakage. The resulting system is streamable end-to-end, with <80 ms GPU latency.

We conducted an eight-week longitudinal study with 15 undergraduates who used AI to support assigned readings in a course.

Comprehension prompts dominated (59.6%), with Reasoning (29.8%), Metacognition (8.5%), and Decoding (2.1%) less frequent. Most sessions (72%) contained exactly three prompts, the required minimum of the reading assignment. Within sessions, students showed natural cognitive progression from comprehension toward reasoning, but this progression was truncated. Across eight weeks, students' engagement patterns remained stable, with substantial individual differences persisting throughout. Qualitative analysis revealed an intention-behavior gap: students recognized that effective prompting required effort but rarely applied this knowledge, with efficiency emerging as the primary driver. Students also strategically triaged their engagement based on interest and academic pressures, exhibiting a novel pattern of reading through AI rather than with it: using AI-generated summaries as primary material to filter which sections merited deeper attention.

We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a \"Semantic Anchor\" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k < 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u6210VLMs\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5361\u8f66\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5361\u8f66\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0cVLMs\u867d\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8def\u8fb9LiDAR\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u906e\u6321\u7684LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u76842D\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u6210\u7684VLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5361\u8f66\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u7c7b\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bcf\u7c7b\u4ec516 - 30\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\u201d\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8575%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684ITS\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u521d\u59cb\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u67093D\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8303\u5f0fRoSE\uff0c\u5c06\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9634\u5f71\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6cd5\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5b58\u57283D\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6cd5\u7ebf\u56fe\u5916\u89c2\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u91cd\u5efa\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6cd5\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u5c06\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9634\u5f71\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u63d0\u51faRoSE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u9634\u5f71\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u51e1\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6cd5\u7ebf\u56fe\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6MultiShade\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3RoSE\u3002", "result": "RoSE\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u548cRoSE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u76843D\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity.

While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific \"vascular fingerprint\" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models.

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework.

Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons.

According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance.

Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic.

In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation.

Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed.

Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder.

We identify a key quantity that, for each method, describes how the performance degrades as the step size becomes too large.

While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$\u0394$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video.

Existing stem generation approaches, however, either rely on fixed architectures that output a predefined set of stems in parallel, or generate only one stem at a time, resulting in slow inference despite flexibility in stem combination. We propose Stemphonic, a diffusion-/flow-based framework that overcomes this trade-off and generates a variable set of synchronized stems in one inference pass. During training, we treat each stem as a batch element, group synchronized stems in a batch, and apply a shared noise latent to each group. At inference-time, we use a shared initial noise latent and stem-specific text inputs to generate synchronized multi-stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to enable one-pass conditional multi-stem generation and stem-wise activity controls to empower users to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of a mix. We benchmark our results on multiple open-source stem evaluation sets and show that Stemphonic produces higher-quality outputs while accelerating the full mix generation process by 25 to 50%.
