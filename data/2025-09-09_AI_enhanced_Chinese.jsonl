Exploiting\nthese vulnerabilities allows an entity with superior cognitive awareness to\ngain a strategic advantage, a concept referred to as cognitive arbitrage. This\npaper investigates how to exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT) attackers and proposes cognition-aware defenses that\nleverage windows of superiority to counteract attacks. Specifically, the\nproposed bi-level cyber warfare game focuses on \"strategic-level\" design for\ndefensive deception mechanisms, which then facilitates \"operational-level\"\nactions and tactical-level execution of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n(TTPs). Game-theoretic reasoning and analysis play a significant role in the\ncross-echelon quantitative modeling and design of cognitive arbitrage\nstrategies. Our numerical results demonstrate that although the defender's\ninitial advantage diminishes over time, strategically timed and deployed\ndeception techniques can turn a negative value for the attacker into a positive\none during the planning phase, and achieve at least a 40% improvement in total\nrewards during execution. This demonstrates that the defender can amplify even\nsmall initial advantages, sustain a strategic edge over the attacker, and\nsecure long-term objectives, such as protecting critical assets throughout the\nattacker's lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6301\u7eed\u5a01\u80c1\uff08APT\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u53ef\u653e\u5927\u521d\u59cb\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u4fdd\u969c\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u83b7\u5f97\u6218\u7565\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297 APT \u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u6218\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u9632\u5fa1\u6b3a\u9a97\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6218\u7565\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5c42\u7ea7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u521d\u59cb\u4f18\u52bf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u9002\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u6b3a\u9a97\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u89c4\u5212\u9636\u6bb5\u6536\u76ca\u53d8\u6b63\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u603b\u5956\u52b1\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u5347 40%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u521d\u59cb\u5c0f\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6218\u7565\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5982\u4fdd\u62a4\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u4ea7\u3002"}}

Accurate\nclassification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels,\nbut their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used\nbecause they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often\ncontain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels\n(FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by\ncarefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly\nmanual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse\nitems. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation\nLearning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with\nlarge language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL\ndataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier\nfinds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our\nexperiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored\nitem feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In\ncontrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the\nimprovement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy.\nThese contrasting results are due to the data diversity driven by KARL's\nknowledge expansion, suggesting the need for a dynamic sampling strategy that\nadjusts diversity based on the prediction context (ID or OOD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKARL\u6846\u67b6\u878d\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e92\u8865\u7269\u54c1\u5173\u7cfb\u6807\u7b7e\u521b\u5efa\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728OOD\u548cID\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u8005\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKnowledge - Augmented Relation Learning (KARL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548cLLM\u6807\u7b7e\u6269\u5c55\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6269\u5927\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfFBL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728OOD\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cKARL\u4f7f\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534737%\uff1b\u5728ID\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u4e8e0.5%\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7531\u4e8eKARL\u77e5\u8bc6\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08ID\u6216OOD\uff09\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While existing work has focused on static provision and exogenous\nexit strategies, we characterise the optimal exit time as the solution to a\nstochastic control problem with an endogenous stopping time. Mathematically,\nthe LP's value function is shown to satisfy a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nquasi-variational inequality, for which we establish uniqueness in the\nviscosity sense. To solve the problem numerically, we develop two complementary\napproaches: a Euler scheme based on operator splitting and a Longstaff-Schwartz\nregression method. Calibrated simulations highlight how the LP's optimal exit\nstrategy depends on the oracle price volatility, fee levels, and the behaviour\nof arbitrageurs and noise traders.

We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a\nvariational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions,\nusing statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy.

In\nprivacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into\nneighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget\ntargets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in\nexisting benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general\nknowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and\nrelationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic\niteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto\nstandards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically\nevaluate these common practices.

This article\nuses a series of one-shot experiments to quantify the behavioral, welfare and\ndistribution consequences of large language models (LLMs) on AI-AI,\nHuman-Human, Human-AI and Human-AI-Human expert markets. Using a credence goods\nframework where experts have private information about the optimal service for\nconsumers, we find that Human-Human markets generally achieve higher levels of\nefficiency than AI-AI and Human-AI markets through pro-social expert\npreferences and higher consumer trust. Notably, LLM experts still earn\nsubstantially higher surplus than human experts -- at the expense of consumer\nsurplus - suggesting adverse incentives that may spur the harmful deployment of\nLLMs. Concurrently, a majority of human experts chooses to rely on LLM agents\nwhen given the opportunity in Human-AI-Human markets, especially if they have\nagency over the LLM's (social) objective function. Here, a large share of\nexperts prioritizes efficiency-loving preferences over pure self-interest.\nDisclosing these preferences to consumers induces strong efficiency gains by\nmarginalizing self-interested LLM experts and human experts. Consequently,\nHuman-AI-Human markets outperform Human-Human markets under transparency rules.\nWith obfuscation, however, efficiency gains disappear, and adverse expert\nincentives remain. Our results shed light on the potential opportunities and\nrisks of disseminating LLMs in the context of expert services and raise several\nregulatory challenges. On the one hand, LLMs can negatively affect human trust\nin the presence of information asymmetries and partially crowd-out experts'\nother-regarding preferences through automation. On the other hand, LLMs allow\nexperts to codify and communicate their objective function, which reduces\ninformation asymmetries and increases efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u7c7b\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u76c8\u4f59\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u9047\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u798f\u5229\u548c\u5206\u914d\u540e\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u4fe1\u4efb\u54c1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u7c7b\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd - \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e02\u573a\uff1b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u76c8\u4f59\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u900f\u660e\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u7c7b\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u9047\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u76d1\u7ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u4ed6\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

The\nwide adoption of microservice architecture exacerbates failure management due\nto increased service components. To be effective, the strategies to enhance the\napplication service resilience need to be autonomous and developed at the\nservice's granularity, considering its end-to-end components. However, the\nmassive amount of observability data generated by all these components across\nthe service stack poses a significant challenge in reacting to anomalies and\nrestoring the service quality in real time. Identifying the most informative\nobservability data from across the cloud service stack and timely localization\nof root causes of anomalies thus becomes crucial to ensure service resilience.\nThis article presents a novel approach that considers the application service\ntopology to select the most informative metrics across the cloud stack to\nsupport efficient, explainable, and accurate root cause identifications in case\nof performance anomalies. The usefulness of the selected metrics is then\nevaluated using the state-of-the-art Root Cause Detection (RCD) algorithm for\nlocalizing the root cause of performance anomalies. As a step towards improving\nthe accuracy and efficiency of RCD, this article then proposes the\nTopology-Aware-RCD (TA-RCD) that incorporates the end-to-end application\nservice topology in RCD.

However, their widespread adoption has raised\nserious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on\nedge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology\nprivacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing\ntheir vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a\nsuite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure\nof a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our\nfindings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that\nexisting edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they\neither fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a\nnovel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining\nmodel accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a\nsynthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the\nGNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with\nminimal impact on model accuracy.

For parts that will be\nfabricated with subtractive and formative manufacturing processes, existing\nreverse engineering techniques can be readily applied, but parts produced with\nadditive manufacturing can present new challenges due to the high level of\nprocess-induced distortions and unique part attributes. This paper introduces\nan integrated 3D scanning and process simulation data-driven framework to\nminimize distortions of reverse-engineered additively manufactured components.\nThis framework employs iterative finite element simulations to predict\ngeometric distortions to minimize errors between the predicted and measured\ngeometrical deviations of the key dimensional characteristics of the part. The\neffectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by reverse engineering two\nInconel-718 components manufactured using laser powder bed fusion additive\nmanufacturing. This paper presents a remanufacturing process that combines\nreverse engineering and additive manufacturing, leveraging geometric\nfeature-based part compensation through process simulation. Our approach can\ngenerate both compensated STL and parametric CAD models, eliminating laborious\nexperimentation during reverse engineering. We evaluate the merits of STL-based\nand CAD-based approaches by quantifying the errors induced at the different\nsteps of the proposed approach and analyzing the influence of varying part\ngeometries.

A central\nchallenge lies in identifying subpopulations that respond differently to\ninterventions, thereby enabling more targeted and effective decision-making.\nWhile clustering methods are well-studied in unsupervised learning, their\nintegration with causal inference remains limited. We propose a novel framework\nthat clusters individuals based on estimated treatment effects using a learned\nkernel derived from causal forests, revealing latent subgroup structures. Our\napproach consists of two main steps. First, we estimate debiased Conditional\nAverage Treatment Effects (CATEs) using orthogonalized learners via the\nRobinson decomposition, yielding a kernel matrix that encodes sample-level\nsimilarities in treatment responsiveness.

Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk\ntree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient\napproximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we\napproximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal\nprobability of a vertex's spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.\n  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we\nindeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in\nturn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model.

Using a\ncalibrated AMOC box model, we conduct large ensemble simulations and show that\ntransition behavior is inherently probabilistic: under identical freshwater\nforcing scenarios, some ensemble members exhibit transitions while others do\nnot. In this stochastic regime, traditional early warning indicators based on\ncritical slowing down are unreliable in predicting impending transitions. To\naddress this limitation, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\napproach that identifies higher-order statistical differences between\ntransitioning and non-transitioning trajectories within the ensemble\nrealizations.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x\nhigher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFineServe\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFineServe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542bKV Slab\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4e24\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914dKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u542b\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "FineServe\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709GPU\u5171\u4eab\u7cfb\u7edfSLO\u8fbe\u6210\u7387\u9ad82.2\u500d\uff0ctoken\u751f\u6210\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9ad81.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FineServe\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The practical value of R&S\ndepends on accurate simulation input modeling, which often suffers from the\ncurse of input uncertainty due to limited data.

Recent DRR&S studies suggest a key structural insight:\nadditivity in budget allocation is essential for efficiency. However, existing\njustifications are heuristic, and fundamental properties such as consistency\nand the precise allocation pattern induced by additivity remain poorly\nunderstood. In this paper, we propose a simple additive allocation (AA)\nprocedure that aims to exclusively sample the $k + m - 1$ previously\nhypothesized critical scenarios. Leveraging boundary-crossing arguments, we\nestablish a lower bound on the probability of correct selection and\ncharacterize the procedure's budget allocation behavior.

Notably, the worst-case scenarios of non-best alternatives may not be\namong them, challenging prior beliefs about their criticality. These results\noffer new and counterintuitive insights into the additive structure of DRR&S.\nTo improve practical performance while preserving this structure, we introduce\na general additive allocation (GAA) framework that flexibly incorporates\nsampling rules from traditional R&S procedures in a modular fashion.

CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,\nincluding raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained\nlanguage model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined\nbiochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance\nadaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module\nthat learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance\nand input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE\nmodule further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We\nadditionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to\nexplicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness\nand inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and\ngeneralization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including\nPrecision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of\nmultimodal feature integration.

Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded\narchitecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and\nranking stages.

Recent advances in\ngenerative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative\nsearch as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely\nend-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first\nand then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency\nand limited generalization.

A unified training\nframework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and\nimproving representation quality and generation accuracy.

However, urban road\nnetworks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate\nrepresentation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from\nneighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus\non a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The\nperformance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more\nfrom incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in\ncomplex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the\nmost competitive baseline method.

In\nthis work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure\ntools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via\nlow-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using\na random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic\ngraphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results.

The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological\napproach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model\nfor the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that\nthese two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored\nreciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently\nmapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool\nthat leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other\nestimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our\nestimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented\naround this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against\nnoise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving\nthe NMF nonidentifiability problem.

To harness these new capabilities while ensuring\ntrustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in\nthe Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE\nfor Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational\npillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest\ndifferently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to\nsupport this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command\ncenter where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such\nas Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The\nAgent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform\ntasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex\ntrade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated\nhuman callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering\nactivities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating\nthe practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This\npaper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,\noutlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE.

Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a\nconceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide\ndialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric\ntenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08SASE\uff09\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8SE\u9886\u57df\u5411\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u4ee3\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u67f1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgent Command Environment (ACE)\u548cAgent Execution Environment (AEE)\u4e24\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\u652f\u6301\u613f\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u5411\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8SE\u9886\u57df\u5411\u4ee3\u7406\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While dimension reduction is indispensable for analyzing such\ndata, conventional approaches often rely on log-ratio transformations that\ncompromise interpretability and distort the data through ad hoc zero\nreplacements. We introduce a novel framework for interpretable dimension\nreduction of compositional data that avoids extra transformations and zero\nimputations. Our approach generalizes the concept of amalgamation by softening\nits operation, mapping high-dimensional compositions directly to a\nlower-dimensional simplex, which can be visualized in ternary plots. The\nframework further provides joint visualization of the reduction matrix,\nenabling intuitive, at-a-glance interpretation. To achieve optimal reduction\nwithin our framework, we incorporate sufficient dimension reduction, which\ndefines a new identifiable objective: the central compositional subspace.

Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which\nhampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be\nunsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is\noften not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning\nwith an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying\nthe labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the\nthreshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query\nstrategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to\nmaximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between\nanomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance\nof DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of\nmislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings\nindicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others\nappear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real\nworld, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and\nthe number of samples they are willing to label.

One branch of\nthe law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination\nlaw. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the \"less\ndiscriminatory alternative\" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g.,\nmodel) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves\ncomparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort.\nNotably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant\n(the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI\ncases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet\nhigh-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most\nlitigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to\ntheir model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to\nreproduce a similar model from scratch.\n  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an\nLDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model\naccess. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic\nparity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we\nprovide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier\n(PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the \"low-resource\nregime,\" then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being\ncontested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus\nserves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the\nclaimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the\nclaimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small)\nmodels. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling\nlaw holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7d22\u8d54\u4eba\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u5224\u65ad\u2018\u8f83\u5c11\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u2019\uff08LDA\uff09\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u635f\u5931 - \u516c\u5e73\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff08PF\uff09\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\u53ca\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53cd\u6b67\u89c6\u6cd5\u7684AI\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7d22\u8d54\u4eba\u8bc1\u660eLDA\u5b58\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u805a\u7126\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5e73\u7b49\u5b9a\u4e49\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u5b9a\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u635f\u5931 - \u516c\u5e73PF\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c11\u91cf\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u7279\u5b9aPF\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u635f\u5931 - \u516c\u5e73PF\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u4ecd\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u7d22\u8d54\u4eba\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5224\u65adLDA\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

However, most\nexisting frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web\nautomation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,\nmulti-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with\ncustomized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial\nreasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools\nuniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different\ngeospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level\nplanner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to\nspecialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then\ndesign a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs\nadaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the\nquery, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)\noperate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces\ncognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise\ncoordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse\ngeospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and\nMapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented\nand agentic baselines.

The optimization\nsolution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus\nalgorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is\ntypically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but\nthey exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL,\nthe generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the\noptimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily\nconverge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The\nproposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along\nwith the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the\ncoupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the\nalgorithm.

In many settings, it is\ncritical to administer treatments that improve patient outcomes or to implement\nplans that generate greater revenue from customers. Within a machine learning\nframework, such objectives are naturally captured through the notion of\ncumulative regret. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental trade-off\nbetween social welfare loss and statistical accuracy in (adaptive) experiments\nwith heterogeneous treatment effects.

Beyond estimating CATEs,\npractitioners often aim to deploy treatment policies that maximize welfare\nacross the entire population.

It acts as a bridge between problem setters and problem solvers,\nhelping solvers prepare for time constraints and unfamiliar problems while\nallowing setters to self-host assessments, offering a no-cost and customizable\nsolution for technical assessments in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdOpenCoderRank\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u51fa\u9898\u8005\u4e0e\u89e3\u9898\u8005\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0cLLMs\u867d\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u51fa\u9898\u8005\u51fa\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u89e3\u9898\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OpenCoderRank\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8fde\u63a5\u51fa\u9898\u8005\u548c\u89e3\u9898\u8005\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "OpenCoderRank\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6613\u7528\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u9898\u8005\u5e94\u5bf9\u8003\u8bd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u51fa\u9898\u8005\u81ea\u6258\u7ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

A key challenge in verifying unlearning\nis forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target\npoint, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing\ninformation. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data\npoints whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance\n$\\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a\nframework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural\nnetworks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on\nthe order of $\\epsilon$, and when $\\epsilon$ is small enough, $\\epsilon^d$.\nMore generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging\nset measure decays as $\\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and\n$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.\nExtensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the\nsame asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing\nthat, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly\nsampling a forging point is vanishingly small.

However, existing\nsolutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target\nvariables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into\nthe model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to\npromote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two\nchallenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the\ntarget system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and\nfuture variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\model, a\nnovel framework for modeling \\underline{exo}genous variables in\n\\underline{s}patio-\\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,\nthen balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated\nexpert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent\nspace to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized\nsub-experts.

A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it\neasier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore\nall potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward\nand backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any\npreviously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution\npaths within the state space.\n  Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using\nexisting multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e.\nstates which are not encountered during regular execution. This can\nsignificantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend\nsubstantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse,\nmay mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is\ncaused by the debugger.\n  This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can\naccommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the\nsemantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring\nthat despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the\ndebugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during\nregular execution.\n  We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino\nWebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of\nour techniques.

The so-called \"classical shadow\" method\nefficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states,\nenabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few\nmeasurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or\nwhen classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is\nnot always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue\nquantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares\nclassical shadows with ``quantum footage,\" which refers to direct quantum\nmeasurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of\ndownload efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For\nobservables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical\nshadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is\nlarge and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large\nHermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when\nthe number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits\nfall within a certain range.

This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of\npolicies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system\nobjectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.\nWe also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate\nrisk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,\nshowcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed\nstrategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more\nrobust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply\nchains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165CVaR\u8003\u8651\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u4ef7\u503c\u8003\u8651\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u54cd\u5e94\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a\nsite-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on\nfine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are\ndifficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper\nintroduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed\nspecifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a\ndiscretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first\nconverts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical\ntokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal\nrepresentation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on\nthese token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising\napproximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM\ndevelops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between\natmospheric conditions and power output.

Traditional\ndeep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating\npenalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.\nHowever, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees\nand frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.\nBuilding upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a\nmulti-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE\n(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution\nwhen the problem is feasible.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel\nmultimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to\nacquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality.

To\nefficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local\nquasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism\nwithin our Transformer-based model.

Experimental evaluations show that the system\nproduces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement\n$\\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,\nsafety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models\ntrained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement\n($\\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage\n($\\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain\nstable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing\nperformance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,\nMD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce\nthe chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the\nmodel engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer\nand richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of\nhigher privacy risk.

Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on\nfive-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.\nThe model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,\nincorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)\nconstraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared\nerror (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,\nlatent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model\nachieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,\nwhere predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both\nreconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related\nfeatures (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned\nwith model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were\nless strongly encoded.

Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on\nbenign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive\nrates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive\nviews through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In\ncontrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative\npairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented\nsamples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious\ndistributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This\napproach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after\npretraining on benign traffic.

We explore how real-time data anonymization,\nethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be\nintegrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential\nfor backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious\ngame-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving\nframework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling\ndiagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting\ndisorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs\nbased on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized\ndata. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we\npresent a two-stage framework that preserves privacy.

This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in\nstructured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity\nbounds.\n  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between\nmeasurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces\nto structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities\nfor decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a\nmemory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a\nmeasurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law\nof Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical\nbounds based on the Second Law.\n  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty\nPrinciple,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be\nminimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist\ncomplete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic\neffects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance\nto mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a\nmodel-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance\ncomponents are inherently easier to learn.\n  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual\nlearning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower\ntraining cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization\nexperiments.

A critical aspect of\nreal-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually\nadded and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical\nstudies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to\nadequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this\npaper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent\nand non-identically distributed data points.

A central element of this process is the patient summary,\ntypically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,\nor their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records\ninto a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is\noften labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical\ninformation.

Evaluating predicted patient\nsummaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic\nvariation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate\nthe measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these\nevaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework\ndesigned to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated\nsummaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board\ndiscussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results\nshow that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including\npartial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict\nentailment criteria.

Despite growing interest, identifying\na scalable and reliable approach for automatic EduKG generation remains a\nchallenge. In an attempt to develop a unified and robust pipeline for automatic\nEduKG construction, in this study we propose a pipeline for automatic EduKG\nconstruction from PDF learning materials. The process begins with generating\nslide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, which are then merged to form\na comprehensive EduKG representing the entire learning material. We evaluate\nthe accuracy of the EduKG generated from the proposed pipeline in our MOOC\nplatform, CourseMapper. The observed accuracy, while indicative of partial\nsuccess, is relatively low particularly in the educational context, where the\nreliability of knowledge representations is critical for supporting meaningful\nlearning.

These results\nhighlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent\ndebate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance\ndegradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to\nresist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6709\u65f6\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8fa9\u8bba\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u540c\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u60f3\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8fa9\u8bba\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u56e0\u540c\u4f34\u63a8\u7406\u4ece\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u8f6c\u5411\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f2\u76ee\u5e94\u7528\u8fa9\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002"}}

We categorize key approaches, examine sources of\npreference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as\nscalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.\nThe goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to\nthe evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdDRL\u548cDPO\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u8c03LVLMs\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ca\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5fae\u8c03LVLMs\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3DRL\u548cDPO\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u9700\u6c42\u7684LVLMs\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

For example, a model that can change a variable name like\nuserIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index\nwithout reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and\ndiscovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned\non forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability\nto reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,\nthey developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three\ntypes of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative\nexamples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.\nThis approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level\npattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally\nwithout explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT\nsuccessfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse\nperformance while maintaining forward task capabilities.

Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity.

Previous approaches have\nfocused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal\nmodeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also\nhighly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided\nvideo summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive\nlinguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the\nobjects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video\nsummarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We\npresent recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which\nformulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,\nrespectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph\nedges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent\nthe edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language\nqueries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling\nthem to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy\nto refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.\nIn our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several\nbenchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised\nand unsupervised manners.

Although\nindividual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,\nscheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain\ncomputationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.\nExisting multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and\nexperience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive\nprocess. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an\nobstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a\nshared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our\napproach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on\nprocedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot\nconfigurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of\nscenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning\nto generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems\nof task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly\ngenerated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen\nsettings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We\nfurther demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its\nuse in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times.

A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for\nindividual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling\nlinks to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed.\nOur approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised}\nlearning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing\nscheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level.\nIn simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link\nsparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces\nradio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u94fe\u8def\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u62e5\u585e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u94fe\u8def\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fde\u63a5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u62e5\u585e\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u91cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u8c03\u6574\u94fe\u8def\u7ade\u4e89\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u7ea6\u675f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6700\u591a500\u6761\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u591a\u8df3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u94fe\u8def\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u62e5\u585e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u94fe\u8def\u8c03\u5ea6\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Most previous works either only consider one\nperson or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the\nbody orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change\nover each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two\npeople's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically\nconsistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger\nspace. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which\nis composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and\ncoherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For\neach sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and\ncollaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The\naudios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.\nInterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting\nand relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also\ndemonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates\ninteractive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.\nOur method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also\npropose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial\nexpressions.

For digital imagery, a\nmultitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,\nincluding semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that\nrecalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape\nviewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control\nperceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for\nforensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing\ndeeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This\nstudy seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation\nchain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking\nsystem is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of\ntransformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks\nare tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner\nthat is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable.

Moreover, acoustic sequences often\ninclude frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or\nsilence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new\ninsight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal\nis to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall\nensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant\nor noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on\nthis new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment\nmodel that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural\nasymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic\nmodalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at\nleast one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic\nmappings from acoustic to linguistic units.

Existing models for TCM utilize\ntraditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula\nrelationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula\ncompositions and detailed explanations.

One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific\ncharacteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid\nvelocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete\npoints in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or\ncomputational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data\nis ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the\nmean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.\nTherefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical\ncharacteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector\nsimilarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here\nand implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting\nproblem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in\nPIV images.

Domain Generalization (DG) aims to\naddress this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for\ngreater diversity.

Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that\nleverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the\ndomain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped\nonto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen\ndomain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both\ntraining and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively\nreduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen\ndomains.

The TSPC\nemploys a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme\nset as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling.\nExperimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing\nbaselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a\nsignificantly lower word error rate of 20.8\\% with reduced training resources.\nFurthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme\nadaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS\nVietnamese-English ASR scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed - \u82f1\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u97f3\u7d20\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSPC\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b57\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u97f3\u7d20\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSPC\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u97f3\u7d20\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u97f3\u7d20\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "TSPC\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed - \u82f1\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5982PhoWhisper - base\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620.8%\u7684\u8f83\u4f4e\u5b57\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u7d20\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This article investigates the\nrequirement under the AI Act that Member States establish national AI\nregulatory sandboxes for testing and validation of innovative AI systems under\nregulatory supervision to assist with fostering innovation and complying with\nregulatory requirements. Against the backdrop of the EU objective that AI\nregulatory sandboxes would both foster innovation and assist with compliance,\nconsiderable challenges are identified for Member States around\ncapacity-building and design of regulatory sandboxes. While Member States are\nearly movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the\narticle contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by\nindividual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the\nAI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play\nsandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission\nand the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to\nensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes.\nWith sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory\nsandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is\nalso explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules\nduring the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of\nconformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators\ncontemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct\ncompliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards\nand conformity assessment procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u4e0b\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u5efa\u7acb\u56fd\u5bb6AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u6c99\u76d2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6b27\u59d4\u4f1a\u548cAI\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c99\u76d2\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u8005\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u5efa\u7acb\u56fd\u5bb6AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u6c99\u76d2\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u76d1\u7ba1\u6c99\u76d2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3001\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u8005\u7684\u987e\u8651\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u6c99\u76d2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u6c99\u76d2\u505a\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6cd5\u6848\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6c99\u76d2\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b27\u6d32\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u548cAI\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u9700\u5236\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6307\u5357\u786e\u4fdd\u56fd\u5bb6AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u6c99\u76d2\u534f\u8c03\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6c99\u76d2\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u8005\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model\nresponses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG\noutputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a\ndifferential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of\nnon-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity\ngap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation.\nIt generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of\nmember-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from\nnon-member-retrieved documents. Experiments under progressively relaxed\nassumptions show that DCMI consistently outperforms baselines--for example,\nachieving 97.42% AUC and 94.35% Accuracy against the RAG system with Flan-T5,\nexceeding the MBA baseline by over 40%. Furthermore, on real-world RAG\nplatforms such as Dify and MaxKB, DCMI maintains a 10%-20% advantage over the\nbaseline. These results highlight significant privacy risks in RAG systems and\nemphasize the need for stronger protection mechanisms.

A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral\nimagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while\nhyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior\nhyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix\nfactorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and\nspectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based\nmodel that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while\npreserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes\nfive multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at\nthe same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors\ngrow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To\naddress this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively\nexpands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.\nMoreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and\norders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise\nrelations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our\nmodel achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,\noutperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by\nmore than half.

Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to\nadaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy\nconvergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in\nprobability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive\nexperiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a\npreviously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to\nconverge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence\ncreates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is\npractically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations\nof complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive\nexperiments to balance bias and variance.\n  Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms\nthat are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on\nthis guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an\ninverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic\nnormality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that\nthe proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals,\nand can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of\noffline policy evaluation.

In\nrecent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer\narchitectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;\nhowever, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,\nrestricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework\ninspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework\nachieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to\nconventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive\naccuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a\ngradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of\nspecific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability.

One prominent line of research addresses these\nlimitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically\nreshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These\nimages can then be classified based on their textural information using\ncomputer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware\nmore effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D\nimages results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,\ncaused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D\ndependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal\nlimits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work\naddresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which\navoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not\nsuffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.\nIt is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to\nclassify these 1D signals for improved performance.

Our\nCNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively\nsurpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported\nmachine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on\nthe power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and\ncomplex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed\npressure.

Developers write\nprograms as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded\ninputs specified using layout types.

However,\nsince we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in\npreserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with\nmulti-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization\nmodels. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization\nframework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and\nalleviate identity confusion with scalability. With \"multi-to-multi matching\"\nparadigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment\noptimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing\nimage customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on\ndiffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable\ncustomization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both\nsynthesised and real parts.

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral\nefficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude.

To address\nthis, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with\nBehavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,\nto the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control\nstrategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method\nbegins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from\ntrajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)\ncontroller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed\nby a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process\ndynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid\noffline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable\nof handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open\nPBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral\nof Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%\nrelative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased\nsubstantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an\nimportant factor for minimizing operational costs.

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies.

Exposing\nstark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them\nto human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and\npitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u70b9\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u89c2\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7279\u70b9\u53ca\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u89c2\u70b9\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5229\u5f0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u70b9\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u679c\u5e38\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4e09\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6b65\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\u9648\u8ff0\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fc5\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4f7f\u89c2\u70b9\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u76f8\u5e94\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u9677\u9631\u3002"}}

While\nconvolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,\ntheir limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts\nintegrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,\ncomputationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we\npresent a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for\nreal-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin\nTransformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways\nto preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike\nexisting designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is\nsignificantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's\nability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of\nlabeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning\nmethod that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary\nrepetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the\nentire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary\nsegmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy\nwith substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it\nas a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited\nclinical environments.
