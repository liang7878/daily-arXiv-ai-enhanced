The scaling\nlaws and popularity of AI models lead to the deployment of incredibly powerful\nGPU clusters in commercial data centers.

In this paper, we study the problem of\nscaling analytical SQL queries on distributed clusters of GPUs, with the stated\ngoal of establishing an upper bound on the likely performance gains. To do so,\nwe build a prototype designed to maximize performance by leveraging ML/HPC best\npractices, such as group communication primitives for cross-device data\nmovements. This allows us to conduct thorough performance experimentation to\npoint our community towards a massive performance opportunity of at least\n60$\\times$.

While LLMs\noffer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation,\ntheir high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to\ncloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a\nsystematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained\nedge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA,\nGemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization\ntechniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to\nestimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that\n4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while\nmaintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines.

In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental\nparadigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on\ntwo well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's\nDilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational\nplay in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions,\nwe evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality\ncharacteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human\nheuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation\nwhen future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly\nand demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game\nenvironment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures\nin strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find\neffective strategies in adaptive situations.

We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an\nupper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and\nthe policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates.

Following this, we\nintroduce a novel imputation framework, Macomss, specifically designed to\nhandle structurally and heterogeneously occurring missing data. We establish\ntheoretical guarantees for Macomss, ensuring its robustness in preserving the\nintegrity and reliability of integrated analyses. To assess its empirical\nperformance, we conduct extensive simulation studies that replicate the complex\nmissingness patterns observed in real-world EHR systems, complemented by\nvalidation using EHR datasets from the Duke University Health System (DUHS).\n  Results: Simulation studies show that our approach consistently outperforms\nexisting imputation methods. Using datasets from three hospitals within DUHS,\nMacomss achieves the lowest imputation errors for missing data in most cases\nand provides superior or comparable downstream prediction performance compared\nto benchmark methods.\n  Conclusions: We provide a theoretically guaranteed and practically meaningful\nmethod for imputing structured and sporadic missing data, enabling accurate and\nreliable integrated analysis across multiple EHR datasets.

Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and\ninherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often\nsuffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative\ntraining of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,\nhowever, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet,\nefficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized\nhardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose\nmulti-core CPUs.

ScalableHD employs a\ntwo-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across\ncores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are\nstreamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling\non-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance,\nScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding.\nFurther, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch\nsizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload\ncharacteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits\nHDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs.

Current metric learning methods aim to push negative items away\nfrom the corresponding users and positive items by an absolute geometrical\ndistance margin. However, items may come from imbalanced categories with\ndifferent intra-class variations. Thus, the absolute distance margin may not be\nideal for estimating the difference between user preferences over imbalanced\nitems. To this end, we propose a new method, named discrete scale-invariant\nmetric learning (DSIML), by adding binary constraints to users and items, which\nmaps users and items into binary codes of a shared Hamming subspace to speed up\nthe online recommendation. Specifically, we firstly propose a scale-invariant\nmargin based on angles at the negative item points in the shared Hamming\nsubspace. Then, we derive a scale-invariant triple hinge loss based on the\nmargin. To capture more preference difference information, we integrate a\npairwise ranking loss into the scale-invariant loss in the proposed model.

When\ndevelopers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted\ntechnical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its\ncategories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing\nsuch taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding\ncode, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to\nannotator subjectivity. This study presents ASTAGEN, an initial step toward\nautomating SATD taxonomy generation using large language models (LLMs). Given a\ncomment and its surrounding code, ASTAGEN first generates a concise explanation\nfor each SATD comment, then incrementally generates and updates categories to\nconstruct a taxonomy. We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains:\nquantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully\nrecovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer\nConfiguration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN\nproduces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven,\niterative design.

Recent methods utilizing large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are\nlimited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning\nsamples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on\nsingle-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods\nprimarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,\nthus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens\nmodels' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a\nprompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies\nfor KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by\ncrafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual\ncontent, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)\npairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:\n(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question\nsemantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question\nrewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing\nanswer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.\nBy adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA\nutilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation\nand thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving\nimprovements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by\n1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPGDA - KGQA\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3KGQA\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KGQA\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u5ffd\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPGDA - KGQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5355\u8df3\u4f2a\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u5199\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u5f3a - \u751f\u6210 - \u68c0\u7d22\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6KGQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728WebQSP\u548cComplexWebQuestions\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684F1\u3001Hits@1\u548cAccuracy\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PGDA - KGQA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KGQA\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This complex\ninterplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately\nlinked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that\nrepresents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep\nlearning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In\nthis representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while\nedges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two\nmain steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to\nlearn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the\ngraph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by\npreviously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial\ncoordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes\nfeatures on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned\nstatistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,\nensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential\nfeatures of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst\nnetworks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the\ndatabase, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows\nstochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of\nformations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such\nas flow and transport.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u79bb\u6563\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u751f\u6210\u56fe\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5730\u5c42\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5730\u8d28\u548c\u6c34\u6587\u5730\u8d28\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5f0f\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u79bb\u6563\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u9012\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u9645\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u8f83\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5730\u5c42\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6c34\u6d41\u548c\u8f93\u8fd0\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source.

It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms\nleading to DNA release from cells, such as apoptosis, necrosis or active\nsecretion. One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring\nthe dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer\ndetection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g.\nin the company named GRAIL.\n  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for\ndetecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our\napproach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics\nof ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient\ntesting procedures. Signature theory is a topic of growing interest in the\nMachine Learning community (see Chevyrev2016 and Fermanian2021), which is now\nrecognised as a powerful feature extraction tool for irregularly sampled\nsignals.

Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes\neach weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize\nall transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward\nlayers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and\noptionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters\nproportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters\nproportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed\nfinal adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent\nstate-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes.

Yet, many models, despite being conceptually simple, lack tractable\nlikelihoods. A notable example arises in estimating protein production from\nsnapshot measurements of actively dividing cells. Here, the challenge stems\nfrom cell divisions occurring at non-Exponentially distributed intervals with\neach division stochastically partitioning protein content between daughter\ncells, making protein counts in any given cell a function of its full division\nhistory. Such history dependence precludes a straightforward likelihood based\non a (standard Markovian) master equation. Instead, we employ conditional\nnormalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn\nprobability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods\nfrom simulated data. As a case study, we examine activation of the \\emph{glc3}\ngene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under\nnutrient-limiting conditions.

Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To\nfacilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This\ndesign enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging\navailable resources.

An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5\nreanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based\ndiffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour\ninitialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding\n(GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream\nattention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal\nembeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and\nprobabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range\nForecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations.

By leveraging the connection between\nthe KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of\npolicy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To\nsolve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted\nAutoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies\nand assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE\nresembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of\ntrajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve\nclustering.

However, the\nanthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding\nwhether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or\ninstructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of\ntechnology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical\nchallenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human\nintentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed\nfor non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic\nsystems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and\nsystem-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived\nenjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived\nusefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and\nlearning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,\nwe found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student\nperceptions, with varied effects.

The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior\nsequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence\ncandidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which\nenhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the\nmodel to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior\nknowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing\nquantitative features of the energy landscape.

ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional\nplatforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized\ncognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond\ncentralized constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "ISEK\u6784\u5efa\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9879\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6d8c\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8ba4\u77e5\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u53f0\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWeb3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9879\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u516d\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8c03\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528$ISEK\u4ee3\u5e01\u8fdb\u884c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NFT\u7ba1\u7406\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u79ef\u6781\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6d8c\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "ISEK\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u673a\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u6cbb\u4ee3\u7406\u96c6\u4f53\u8fdb\u5316\u6446\u8131\u96c6\u4e2d\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal\nconfiguration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods\nexhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in\nvision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and\nencoder-based VLM architectures.

Peer support, grounded in\nlived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However,\nvariability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about\nquality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new\nopportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time,\ntext-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an\nLLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions,\nand real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer\nsupporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the\nsystem's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised\nits potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we\nfound a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,\nexperts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such\nas missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment\nhighlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially\nin emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are\nessential.

In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an\narchitectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each\nlayer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs\nshowcase a unique property we coin as \"auto-compression\", the ability of a\nnetwork to organically compress information during training with gradient\ndescent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression,\ninformation is dynamically \"pushed\" into early layers during training,\nenhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in\ndeeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise\ntraining patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during\ntraining based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced\nnoise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in\nlow-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that\ngeneralize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to\n18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression\nwhile maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT\narchitectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional\npruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance\ntrade-offs compared to conventional architectures.

However, achieving stable, long-range\nautoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.\nPrevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as\nSFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard\nspatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the\nprevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce\nphysical consistency and long-term stability.

We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep\nconvolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical\nremapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion\n(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error\naccumulation over long recursive simulations.

However, many\nreal-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles\nin social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is\nperformed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning\nprotocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the\nprivacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of\nGNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy\nguarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node\nclassification accuracy) for graph learning.

Identifying and addressing these threats\nis crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph\nlearning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack\ntargeting locally private graph learning protocols.

Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned\nfrom data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are\nnot identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior\nunder new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer\nthe system. It is known in the community that \"linear ordinary differential\nequations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory.\"\nHowever, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains\nunderexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally\nin many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this\ngap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to\nthe dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive\nprobability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds\nfor this probability.

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

While various approaches have been proposed to address this\nlimitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference\nprocedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a\nsimple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the\ntext generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic\ninformation embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text\ntoken distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision\ntoken at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization.

While\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in\nvisual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical\nimages, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D\nanatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of\nsubtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we\npresent Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits\nenriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection\nfor accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet\nemploys dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and\nfine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment\nwith diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient\nmultimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a\ncompact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By\nassigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly\nperceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,\nfacilitating accurate diagnostic text generation.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal\nprotection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains\nchallenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to\nproduce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy\nguarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during\ngeneration. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30DP - SGD\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0DP\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eDP\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u524d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u65bdDP\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5341\u4e00\u4e2a\u6548\u7528\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30DP - SGD\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684DP\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u3001VAE\u548cGAN\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u6548\u7528 - \u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "DP - SGD\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u65b0DP\u673a\u5236\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u65e0\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65f6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6709DP - SGD\u65f6GANs\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "DP\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u662f\u6311\u6218\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u524d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u7528\u4f8b\u3002"}}

To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that\nincorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency\ndistribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically\nderived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected\ndistributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under\ntemporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts.

However, DAAs\nsuffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the \"reward-generation gap\"\n-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual\ngeneration performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor\nto the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of\nprefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is\nreflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length\nTraining (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to\nmatch the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in\neach sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated\nlengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly\nconstrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to\nprefix tokens than the standard DAAs.

However, most existing backdoor attacks\nrely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking\nthe potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we\nintroduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor\nAttacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor\ntriggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing\nmechanism for injection timing.

Furthermore, we propose\na gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude\nunder environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms\nand nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack\nsuccess rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.\nThese results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of\nprincipled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks.

We validate the\nuniversal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments\nacross a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud\nmodels as backbones.

However, those models struggle with\ncompositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their\nretrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to\nimprove the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In\ncomparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this\npaper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image\nand a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we\nextract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using\na VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining\nmatches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the\nindividual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder\nVLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL\ncompositionality.

We\ninvestigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide\nneedle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning\nstage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan\nquality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of\none selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined\nreward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent\nthen moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple\nrounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.\nPlan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for\ntesting) treated in our clinic were included in this study.

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,\nlarge-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly\nexpands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new\nquestion-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We\ndeveloped a systematic method using large language models to generate these\nquestions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's\ninference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world\nclinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations\nthat mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two\nmain evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test\nmodel robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more\nchallenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate\nthe development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in\nclinical settings.
