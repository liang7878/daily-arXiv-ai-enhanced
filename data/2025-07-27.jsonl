Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is\ncomplex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon\nthe authors' previously established functional and informational requirements\nsupporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:\ntransferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset\ntransfer, the significance of \"sim-to-real transfer\" and \"real-to-sim\ntransfer\"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world\noperations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key\nchallenge in this process is calibrating the \"reality gap,\" the discrepancy\nbetween simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates\nthe impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an\nexisting DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim\ntransfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the\nRGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the\nhistorical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian\nbridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different\nlevels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full\nimplementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is\ncapable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world\noperations without compromising efficiency."}

Building on this finding, this paper not\nonly thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel\nflow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in\nthe gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical\nnumerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient\nconsistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background\npressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To\ncomprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its\npotential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical\nexperiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the\nresidue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven\nfree-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid\nstanding wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the\npressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length,\nresolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient\ncorrection technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be\neffective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability\nis fundamentally limited. Finally, the FDA nozzle, an engineering benchmark, is\ntested to demonstrate the residue influence in a complex geometry, highlighting\nthe necessity of correction schemes in scenarios with unavoidable high\nbackground pressure."}

These applications have diverse token-generation latency\nrequirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting.

Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

Specifically,\nwe develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder\n(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with\ntailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this\nwork uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability\ntensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic\nproperties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to\ndirect LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a\nsynthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of\nvolume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of\nthe VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and\ninterpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The\nstudy provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,\ndemonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and\ninverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials\nwith desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made\nopen-access to support further research."}

Our approach introduces three\nkey innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases\nrelevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that\noperationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data\nanalysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,\ntask-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,\ncritic feedback, and self-reflection.\n  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience\nevaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the\nanalysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher\nthan alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of\nthe analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,\nimplemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid \"wrong question\"\nvulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,\nhttps://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed\nopen-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the\ncommunity."}

Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable\nalternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet\noverlooked issue in this context: security regression.

First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated.

This is one of the first studies to\nhighlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary\nartery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for\nadvancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.

To address this, we propose\nthe Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models\ndistributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using\nfree energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a\nfree-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which\nenables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;\nand (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct\nuncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic\nsampling.

Low dimensional embeddings are employed to\nexpose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments.

In this paper, we first study the\nvariation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under\nvarious scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that\nchallenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this\nconcern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.\nSpecifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian\nsampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse\narray of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against\nvarious challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for\nreal-world reconstruction.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing\ninstruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding\nunlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,\nand Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning\nprocesses and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,\ncustomizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any\ntask. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful\ndata synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3\nwhile utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates\nthat our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source\ncode, models, and scripts are available at https://github.com/Krueske/AQuilt."}

Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via\nmapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.\nSpecifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the\nembedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood\n(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their\ncorresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these\nembedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable\nhuman effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We\ninstantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate\nits effectiveness through case studies.
