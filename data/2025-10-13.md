### [1] [Hypothesis Hunting with Evolving Networks of Autonomous Scientific Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08619)
*Tennison Liu,Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,David L. Bentley,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出假设狩猎概念，介绍AScience框架与ASCollab系统，实验表明其能支持大规模探索性假设狩猎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集带来探索性发现机会，需方法支持跨越巨大复杂假设空间的持续探索。

Method: 引入AScience框架，将发现建模为主体、网络和评估规范的交互，并实现为ASCollab分布式系统，主体自组织成网络，按共享评估标准持续产生和同行评审结果。

Result: 社会动态使结果在多样性 - 质量 - 新颖性前沿积累，包括重新发现既定生物标志物等。

Conclusion: 社会结构化的主体网络能支持大规模探索性假设狩猎，虽湿实验室验证仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

### [2] [Optimizing delivery for quick commerce factoring qualitative assessment of generated routes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08671)
*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 印度电商市场增长快，末段配送成本高，研究提出用大语言模型评估VRP生成路线的框架，经测试有较高准确率，能提升末段物流效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商末段配送成本高，传统VRP求解器在现实场景效果有限，需新评估方法。

Method: 提出用大语言模型根据策略标准评估VRP生成路线的框架，并生成、标注和评估400个案例。

Result: 开源大语言模型识别路线问题准确率79%，专有推理模型达86%。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型评估VRP生成路线有效且可扩展，能提升末段物流成本效率、可靠性和可持续性，对发展中国家有重要意义。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

### [3] [Unified World Models: Memory-Augmented Planning and Foresight for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08713)
*Yifei Dong,Fengyi Wu,Guangyu Chen,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Qiyu Hu,Yuxuan Zhou,Jingdong Sun,Jun-Yan He,Qi Dai,Alexander G Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出统一的记忆增强世界模型UniWM用于具身导航，实验显示其提升导航成功率、减少轨迹误差并具零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有具身导航方法采用模块化架构，导致状态 - 动作不对齐和在新场景适应性有限，需解决此局限。

Method: 提出UniWM，在单一多模态自回归骨干中集成以自我为中心的视觉预见和规划，用分层记忆机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，UniWM将导航成功率最高提升30%，显著减少轨迹误差，在未见数据集上有零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是迈向统一、基于想象的具身导航的重要一步。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

### [4] [Robust Heuristic Algorithm Design with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08755)
*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用解释启发式表现不佳原因及修复建议的工具增强大语言模型启发式设计方法，能生成更鲁棒和高效的启发式算法，新算法在最坏情况性能上比FunSearch好约28倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过增强使用大语言模型进行启发式设计的方法，生成更鲁棒和高效的启发式算法。

Method: 向大语言模型展示启发式表现不佳的实例、解释原因并针对输入空间区域进行专门设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法最坏情况性能比FunSearch好约28倍，平均性能提升且运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 使用解释和建议工具增强大语言模型启发式设计方法可产生更优的启发式算法。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [5] [COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790)
*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出COMPASS框架解决大语言模型代理长时任务问题，在多基准测试提升准确率，还有扩展和后训练管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时任务对大语言模型代理有挑战，上下文管理是瓶颈，模型易因上下文问题犯错。

Method: 提出COMPASS轻量级分层框架，包含主代理、元思考器和上下文管理器三个组件。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，相比单和多代理基线，准确率最多提升20%，还有测试时扩展和后训练管道优化。

Conclusion: COMPASS框架能有效解决大语言模型代理长时任务问题，提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [6] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过实验对比人类和AI对文学风格评估的归因偏差，发现两者均有亲人类偏差，且AI偏差更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具普及，需了解人类和机器如何评估文学风格。

Method: 使用Raymond Queneau的作品进行两项对照实验，研究不同条件下人类和AI的评估。

Result: 人类和AI均有亲人类归因偏差，AI偏差是人类的2.5倍，归因标签会使评估标准倒置。

Conclusion: AI系统不仅复制还放大了人类对人工智能创造力的文化偏见。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

### [7] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Game - Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign)框架，将博弈论决策融入推理和训练，提升大语言模型推理效率、答案质量和共同福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理中有时生成的回答对用户并非最优，传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励等同于最大化用户福利常不成立，缺乏对双方都有利的决策机制。

Method: 构建GTAlign框架，推理时将用户 - 大语言模型交互视为战略博弈，构建收益矩阵选择互利行动；训练时引入共同福利奖励强化合作响应；还引入推理技术根据服务定价策略动态调整响应。

Result: 大量实验表明，GTAlign在不同任务中相比基线显著提高推理效率、答案质量和共同福利。

Conclusion: GTAlign是有效的大语言模型对齐框架，能改善模型在不同任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

### [8] [What Is Your Agent's GPA? A Framework for Evaluating Agent Goal-Plan-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08847)
*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍Agent GPA框架，含五项评估指标，实验表明该框架能系统覆盖多种代理失败情况，支持与人类标注高度一致的大语言模型评判，还能定位错误以提升代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种基于代理操作循环的评估范式，以系统评估代理的性能，覆盖多种代理失败情况。

Method: 引入Agent GPA框架，包含Goal Fulfillment、Logical Consistency、Execution Efficiency、Plan Quality和Plan Adherence五项评估指标。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验显示，框架能系统覆盖多种代理失败，支持与人类标注强一致的大语言模型评判，能以86%的一致性定位错误。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为评估代理性能提供了有效且系统的方法，有助于针对性地改进代理性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

### [9] [ReviewerToo: Should AI Join The Program Committee? A Look At The Future of Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08867)
*Gaurav Sahu,Hugo Larochelle,Laurent Charlin,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ReviewerToo框架用于AI辅助同行评审，在ICLR 2025数据集验证，分析AI评审优劣并提出集成AI到评审流程的指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决同行评审存在的不一致性、评审者主观性和可扩展性挑战。

Method: 引入ReviewerToo模块化框架，支持系统实验，可集成到会议工作流程，在ICLR 2025数据集验证。

Result: gpt - oss - 120b模型分类准确率81.8%，ReviewerToo生成评审被评质量高于人类平均，分析出AI评审的优劣。

Conclusion: 提出集成AI到同行评审流程的指南，为混合同行评审系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Jacopo Tagliabue,Ciro Greco*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文以Bauplan为例，论证API优先的可编程数据湖仓能实现安全的AI代理工作流，并展示概念验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖仓运行敏感工作负载，AI驱动的自动化引发对信任、正确性和治理的担忧。

Method: 以Bauplan为案例研究，利用数据分支和声明式环境扩展到代理，使用受携带证明代码启发的正确性检查。

Result: 原型展示了不可信的AI代理可以安全地处理生产数据。

Conclusion: 勾勒出实现完全代理化数据湖仓的路径。

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

### [11] [EcphoryRAG: Re-Imagining Knowledge-Graph RAG via Human Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08958)
*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 受人类记忆机制启发，提出实体中心的知识图谱RAG框架EcphoryRAG，评估显示其达SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学中人类利用线索激活记忆痕迹进行复杂回忆机制的启发，开发新的知识图谱RAG框架。

Method: 索引时仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据；检索时从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间隐式关系。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，相比HippoRAG等方法，平均精确匹配（EM）分数从0.392提升到0.474。

Conclusion: 实体 - 线索 - 多跳检索范式对复杂问答有效。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

*Yushuo Zheng,Zicheng Zhang,Xiongkuo Min,Huiyu Duan,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LM Fight Arena框架，让大模态模型在格斗游戏中对战以评估其性能，弥补现有基准测试不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模态模型基准测试无法捕捉模型在实时、对抗环境中的性能。

Method: 引入LM Fight Arena框架，让模型在格斗游戏Mortal Kombat II中对战，在控制变量的锦标赛中测试六个主流模型，通过解读游戏帧和状态数据来选择动作。

Result: 提供了一种全自动、可复现且客观的评估方式，能评估大模态模型在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 该工作引入了一个有挑战性且有趣的基准测试，弥合了AI评估和互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

*Ashish Kattamuri,Harshwardhan Fartale,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Ishita Prasad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RADAR框架利用机制可解释性检测大语言模型评估中的数据污染，在评估集上取得高准确率，展示机制可解释性在LLM评估中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染影响大语言模型可靠评估，模型可能靠记忆训练数据而非真正推理能力取得高性能。

Method: 引入RADAR框架，提取37个涵盖表面置信轨迹和深层机制属性的特征，用分类器集成进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，清晰案例中表现完美，有挑战性的模糊案例中准确率76.7%。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性有助于推动大语言模型评估超越传统表面指标。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Motivation: 现有基准多关注RAG特定方面，本文旨在设计评估RAG管道整体能力的基准。

Method: 创建93个问题的数据集、提出短语级召回指标、用近邻嵌入分类器识别幻觉、对2个开源和4个闭源管道对比评估及第三方人类评估。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉指标上显著优于开源管道，在依赖多模态和跨文档信息问题上差距更大；人类评估指标平均认可度较高。

Conclusion: 所设计的基准能有效评估RAG管道，闭源管道表现更优，评估指标获人类认可。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

TL;DR: 提出DualResearch框架解决deep - research框架问题，在科学推理基准测试中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有deep - research框架存在上下文污染、证据支持弱和执行路径脆弱等问题，需要改进。

Method: 联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图，各有相关函数；将每层路径证据转换为答案分布，通过熵门控规则在对数空间融合；压缩多工具执行日志为推理图。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上取得有竞争力的性能，使用InternAgent日志文件，HLE准确率提高7.7%，GPQA提高6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch作为deep - research系统的补充，能稳定有效地重构答案。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Motivation: 现有前缀调优范式在融合知识图谱与大语言模型时忽略了知识图谱的关系语义，给大语言模型带来较大推理负担。

Method: 提出SCT范式，包含语义图模块和条件自适应融合模块，先从局部图邻域提取语义条件，再自适应调整文本嵌入，最后输入大语言模型微调。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试中，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线。

Conclusion: SCT通过在大语言模型推理前用语义图上下文调整输入表示，能提供更直接有效的信号，实现更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在推理效率上有挑战，轻量级MLLMs推理能力研究缺乏。

Method: 第一阶段用Length - Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO)训练推理模型；第二阶段用Adaptive Model Merging (AMM)将多个专家模型合并为统一架构。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试中展示了Tiny - R1V的优越性能。

Conclusion: Tiny - R1V能使轻量级模型在多种多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式易导致ReDoS漏洞，现有修复方法存在权衡问题，需新方法。

Method: 引入混合框架LRR，先由确定性符号模块定位漏洞子模式，再用LLM生成修复方案。

Result: 成功解决复杂修复案例，避免LLM仅用的语义错误，修复率提高15.4%p。

Conclusion: 提供了自动化修复此类问题的有效方法，代码开源。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Motivation: 现有GUI智能体将过去轨迹压缩为文本标记，增加上下文长度且丢失关键视觉线索，需为其赋予可扩展内存以应对不熟悉界面和长时任务。

Method: 提出连续内存，用VLM将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度连续嵌入；引入自动扩展数据飞轮收集轨迹，微调内存编码器。

Conclusion: 所提连续内存和自动扩展数据飞轮方法有效，能增强GUI智能体在长时任务和分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Conclusion: 结合精神分析和人格理论的模型有助于构建更具直觉性和适应性的类人意识AI系统，为改善AI交互开辟新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略在生成最终预测方面有效。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见流匹配求解器兼容，能在不降低图像质量前提下提升多样性。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和大推理模型的计算限制，特别是受有限上下文窗口约束的空间复杂性，仍理解不足，现有工作多关注NP复杂度类问题，需更严格标准评估计算能力。

Method: 基于两个PSPACE完全正则表达式问题构建新基准，进行双指数空间探索，构建包含超百万正则表达式实例的带标签数据集，并进行严格过滤。对6个大语言模型和5个大推理模型进行广泛评估。

Result: 揭示了大语言模型和大推理模型的常见失败模式，如冗长和重复。

Conclusion: 本工作首次对大语言模型和大推理模型的空间计算限制进行实证研究，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大语言模型时，使模型内部表征能在局部主义（可解释、基于规则）到分布式（可泛化、高效）编码间连续调整。

Method: 通过对注意力机制施加组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，引入 locality dial 动态控制局部化程度。

Result: 给出严格数学证明，当组稀疏惩罚超过阈值，模型注意力机制集中在语义相关块，实现低熵和高保真。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能在可解释和高性能模式间连续插值，适用于需透明度和能力的监管领域。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Conclusion: 小语言模型可通过学习规则而非统计学习解决演绎推理任务

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Conclusion: 序列变量能有效解决经典CP模型在VRP中的局限，在问题建模和计算性能上表现良好。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

Method: 引入LiveOIBench基准，包含403个专家精选竞赛题及大量测试用例，对32个流行大模型进行评测。

Result: GPT - 5达81.76百分位但不及顶尖人类选手，GPT - OSS - 120B仅60百分位，模型间能力有差距。

Conclusion: 强大推理模型应注重精确问题分析，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

Abstract: AI-assisted molecular property prediction has become a promising technique in
early-stage drug discovery and materials design in recent years. However, due
to high-cost and complex wet-lab experiments, real-world molecules usually
experience the issue of scarce annotations, leading to limited labeled data for
effective supervised AI model learning. In light of this, few-shot molecular
property prediction (FSMPP) has emerged as an expressive paradigm that enables
learning from only a few labeled examples. Despite rapidly growing attention,
existing FSMPP studies remain fragmented, without a coherent framework to
capture methodological advances and domain-specific challenges. In this work,
we present the first comprehensive and systematic survey of few-shot molecular
property prediction. We begin by analyzing the few-shot phenomenon in molecular
datasets and highlighting two core challenges: (1) cross-property
generalization under distribution shifts, where each task corresponding to each
property, may follow a different data distribution or even be inherently weakly
related to others from a biochemical perspective, requiring the model to
transfer knowledge across heterogeneous prediction tasks, and (2)
cross-molecule generalization under structural heterogeneity, where molecules
involved in different or same properties may exhibit significant structural
diversity, making model difficult to achieve generalization. Then, we introduce
a unified taxonomy that organizes existing methods into data, model, and
learning paradigm levels, reflecting their strategies for extracting knowledge
from scarce supervision in few-shot molecular property prediction. Next, we
compare representative methods, summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation
protocols. In the end, we identify key trends and future directions for
advancing the continued research on FSMPP.

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances
Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness
scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries
and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that
incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a
self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents
degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables
hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes
while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under
controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves
competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the
BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the
end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over
multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\%
relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for
Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with
computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning
(RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing
robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader
structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency
optimization.

Result: 在567个测试用例中生成命令行准确率达92.0%，性能与GPT - 5、Claude和Gemini相当。

Conclusion: Maple在异构高性能计算环境中实现可移植和可扩展的分布式深度学习有实用价值。

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models across Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
clusters is technically challenging. One aspect is that users have to compose
command lines to adapt to the heterogeneous launchers, schedulers, affinity
options, DL framework arguments, and environment variables. Composing correct
command lines is error-prone and can easily frustrate users, impeding research
or wasting resources. In this work, we present Maple, a multi-agent system that
generates correct DL command lines with users' natural language input. Maple
consists of four agents with the functionalities of information extraction,
template retrieval, command line verification, and error correction. We
evaluate Maple on nine GPU clusters across national computing centers in the
U.S., five representative deep learning model families, and four commonly used
parallel DL training paradigms. Our experiments also cover schedulers of SLURM
and PBS and heterogeneous architectures, such as NVIDIA A100/H200 GPUs and
Intel Max series GPUs. Maple achieves 92.0% accuracy in generating command
lines across the 567 test cases. Leverage multiple language models with an
aggregated size of 10B parameters, Maple delivers comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art models of GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini. Together, these results
highlight Maple's practical value in enabling portable and scalable distributed
DL across heterogeneous HPC environments.

Conclusion: 提出的通用单边算法能有效支持分布式矩阵乘法所有分区和复制因子组合，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Many important applications across science, data analytics, and AI workloads
depend on distributed matrix multiplication. Prior work has developed a large
array of algorithms suitable for different problem sizes and partitionings
including 1D, 2D, 1.5D, and 2.5D algorithms. A limitation of current work is
that existing algorithms are limited to a subset of partitionings. Multiple
algorithm implementations are required to support the full space of possible
partitionings. If no algorithm implementation is available for a particular set
of partitionings, one or more operands must be redistributed, increasing
communication costs. This paper presents a universal one-sided algorithm for
distributed matrix multiplication that supports all combinations of
partitionings and replication factors. Our algorithm uses slicing (index
arithmetic) to compute the sets of overlapping tiles that must be multiplied
together. This list of local matrix multiplies can then either be executed
directly, or reordered and lowered to an optimized IR to maximize overlap. We
implement our algorithm using a high-level C++-based PGAS programming framework
that performs direct GPU-to-GPU communication using intra-node interconnects.
We evaluate performance for a wide variety of partitionings and replication
factors, finding that our work is competitive with PyTorch DTensor, a highly
optimized distributed tensor library targeting AI models.

control bandwidth), with computational and memory demands scaling with PE
count. Traditional MPC approaches execute the controller on the PEs, but
operating system overheads create jitter and limit control bandwidth. Running
MPC on dedicated on-chip controllers enables fast, deterministic control but
raises concerns about area and power overhead. In this work, we tackle these
challenges by proposing a hardware-software codesign of a lightweight MPC
controller, based on an operator-splitting quadratic programming solver and an
embedded multi-core RISC-V controller. Key innovations include pruning weak
thermal couplings to reduce model memory and ahead-of-time scheduling for
efficient parallel execution of sparse triangular systems arising from the
optimization problem. The proposed controller achieves sub-millisecond latency
when controlling 144 PEs at 500 MHz, delivering 33x lower latency and 7.9x
higher energy efficiency than a single-core baseline. Operating within a
compact less than 1 MiB memory footprint, it consumes as little as 325 mW while
occupying less than 1.5% of a typical HPC processor's die area.

### [44] [The Online Submodular Cover Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08883)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the submodular cover problem, we are given a monotone submodular function
$f$, and we want to pick the min-cost set $S$ such that $f(S) = f(N)$.
Motivated by problems in network monitoring and resource allocation, we
consider the submodular cover problem in an online setting. As a concrete
example, suppose at each time $t$, a nonnegative monotone submodular function
$g_t$ is given to us. We define $f^{(t)} = \sum_{s \leq t} g_s$ as the sum of
all functions seen so far. We need to maintain a submodular cover of these
submodular functions $f^{(1)}, f^{(2)}, \ldots f^{(T)}$ in an online fashion;
i.e., we cannot revoke previous choices. Formally, at each time $t$ we produce
a set $S_t \subseteq N$ such that $f^{(t)}(S_t) = f^{(t)}(N)$ -- i.e., this set
$S_t$ is a cover -- such that $S_{t-1} \subseteq S_t$, so previously decisions
to pick elements cannot be revoked. (We actually allow more general sequences
$\{f^{(t)}\}$ of submodular functions, but this
sum-of-simpler-submodular-functions case is useful for concreteness.)
  We give polylogarithmic competitive algorithms for this online submodular
cover problem. The competitive ratio on an input sequence of length $T$ is
$O(\ln n \ln (T \cdot f(N) / f_{\text{min}}))$, where $f_{\text{min}}$ is the
smallest nonzero marginal for functions $f^{(t)}$, and $|N| = n$. For the
special case of online set cover, our competitive ratio matches that of Alon et
al. [SIAM J. Comp. 03], which are best possible for polynomial-time online
algorithms unless $NP \subseteq BPP$ (see Korman 04). Since existing offline
algorithms for submodular cover are based on greedy approaches which seem
difficult to implement online, the technical challenge is to (approximately)
solve the exponential-sized linear programming relaxation for submodular cover,
and to round it, both in the online setting.

Motivation: 解决长度受限最小生成树问题，探索平面图和一般图在该问题上的近似算法。

Method: 基于经典平面图分隔器的新长度受限版本设计多项式时间算法。

Result: 为平面图给出 $O(\log^{1 + \epsilon} n)$ 近似解，节点距根节点距离不超过 $(1 + \epsilon)h$；证明一般图上节点距根节点距离不超过 $2h$ 时无法达到 $O(\log ^{2 - \epsilon} n)$ 近似。

Conclusion: 平面图和一般图在长度受限最小生成树问题上的近似性不同。

Abstract: In length-constrained minimum spanning tree (MST) we are given an $n$-node
graph $G = (V,E)$ with edge weights $w : E \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and edge
lengths $l: E \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ along with a root node $r \in V$ and a
length-constraint $h \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. Our goal is to output a spanning
tree of minimum weight according to $w$ in which every node is at distance at
most $h$ from $r$ according to $l$.
  We give a polynomial-time algorithm for planar graphs which, for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$, outputs an $O\left(\log^{1+\epsilon} n\right)$-approximate
solution with every node at distance at most $(1+\epsilon)h$ from $r$ for any
constant $\epsilon > 0$. Our algorithm is based on new length-constrained
versions of classic planar separators which may be of independent interest.
Additionally, our algorithm works for length-constrained Steiner tree.
Complementing this, we show that any algorithm on general graphs for
length-constrained MST in which nodes are at most $2h$ from $r$ cannot achieve
an approximation of $O\left(\log ^{2-\epsilon} n\right)$ for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$ under standard complexity assumptions; as such, our results
separate the approximability of length-constrained MST in planar and general
graphs.

Abstract: This work introduces two techniques for the design and analysis of branching

First, we present a method for automatically generating branching rules through
a systematic case analysis of local structures. Second, we develop a new
technique for analyzing randomized branching algorithms using the Measure &
Conquer method, offering greater flexibility in formulating branching rules. By
combining these innovations with additional techniques, we obtain the fastest
known randomized algorithms in different parameters for the Vertex Cover
problem on graphs with bounded degree (up to 6) and on general graphs. For
example, our algorithm solves Vertex Cover on subcubic graphs in
$O^*(1.07625^n)$ time and $O^*(1.13132^k)$ time, respectively. For graphs with
maximum degree 4, we achieve running times of $O^*(1.13735^n)$ and
$O^*(1.21103^k)$, while for general graphs we achieve $O^*(1.25281^k)$.

Abstract: Billboard Advertisement has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertisement
technique where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play
advertisement content over there with the hope that this will be observed by
many people, and effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced
towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive
integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize
influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial
house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence
demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the
first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective
influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the
problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the
goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots,
S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i
\neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the
products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a
multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization.
For solving the first variant, we adopt the bi-criteria approximation
algorithm, and for the other variant, we propose a sampling-based approximation
algorithm. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard
datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution
approach.

Conclusion: 提出的新分析方法有效，算法在多环境有良好表现，解决了之前未知的快速算法问题。

Abstract: We present a new and surprisingly simple analysis of random-shift
decompositions -- originally proposed by Miller, Peng, and Xu [SPAA'13]: We
show that decompositions for exponentially growing scales $D = 2^0, 2^1,
\ldots, 2^{\log_2(\operatorname{diam}(G))}$, have a tight constant trade-off
between distance-to-center and separation probability on average across the
distance scales -- opposed to a necessary $\Omega(\log n)$ trade-off for a
single scale.
  This almost immediately yields a way to compute a tree $T$ for graph $G$ that
preserves all graph distances with expected $O(\log n)$-stretch. This gives an
alternative proof that obtains tight approximation bounds of the seminal result
by Fakcharoenphol, Rao, and Talwar [STOC'03] matching the $\Omega(\log n)$
lower bound by Bartal [FOCS'96]. Our insights can also be used to refine the
analysis of a simple $\ell_1$-oblivious routing proposed in [FOCS'22], yielding
a tight $O(\log n)$ competitive ratio.
  Our algorithms for constructing tree embeddings and $\ell_1$-oblivious
routings can be implemented in the sequential, parallel, and distributed
settings with optimal work, depth, and rounds, up to polylogarithmic factors.
Previously, fast algorithms with tight guarantees were not known for tree
embeddings in parallel and distributed settings, and for $\ell_1$-oblivious
routings, not even a fast sequential algorithm was known.

Abstract: In this note, we study two rewrite rules on hypergraphs, called
edge-domination and node-domination, and show that they are confluent. These
rules are rather natural and commonly used before computing the minimum hitting
sets of a hypergraph. Intuitively, edge-domination allows us to remove
hyperedges that are supersets of another hyperedge, and node-domination allows
us to remove nodes whose incident hyperedges are a subset of that of another
node. We show that these rules are confluent up to isomorphism, i.e., if we
apply any sequences of edge-domination and node-domination rules, then the
resulting hypergraphs can be made isomorphic via more rule applications. This
in particular implies the existence of a unique minimal hypergraph, up to
isomorphism.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: An extended regular expression $R$ specifies a set of strings formed by
characters from an alphabet combined with concatenation, union, intersection,
complement, and star operators. Given an extended regular expression $R$ and a
string $Q$, the extended regular expression matching problem is to decide if
$Q$ matches any of the strings specified by $R$. Extended regular expressions
are a basic concept in formal language theory and a basic primitive for
searching and processing data. Extended regular expression matching was
introduced by Hopcroft and Ullmann in the 1970s [\textit{Introduction to
Automata Theory, Languages and Computation}, 1979], who gave a simple dynamic
programming solution using $O(n^3m)$ time and $O(n^2m)$ space, where $n$ is the
length of $Q$ and $m$ is the length of $R$. Since then, several solutions have
been proposed, but few significant asymptotic improvements have been obtained.
The current state-of-the art solution, by Yamamoto and Miyazaki~[COCOON, 2003],
uses $O(\frac{n^3k + n^2m}{w} + n + m)$ time and $O(\frac{n^2k + nm}{w} + n +
m)$ space, where $k$ is the number of negation and complement operators in $R$
and $w$ is the number of bits in a word. This roughly replaces the $m$ factor
with $k$ in the dominant terms of both the space and time bounds of the
Hopcroft and Ullmann algorithm.
  We revisit the problem and present a new solution that significantly improves
the previous time and space bounds. Our main result is a new algorithm that
solves extended regular expression matching in \[O\left(n^\omega k +
\frac{n^2m}{\min(w/\log w, \log n)} + m\right)\] time and $O(\frac{n^2 \log
k}{w} + n + m) = O(n^2 +m)$ space, where $\omega \approx 2.3716$ is the
exponent of matrix multiplication. Essentially, this replaces the dominant
$n^3k$ term with $n^\omega k$ in the time bound, while simultaneously improving
the $n^2k$ term in the space to $O(n^2)$.

Abstract: Efficient and equitable access to municipal services hinges on well-designed
administrative divisions. It requires ongoing adaptation to changing
demographics, infrastructure, and economic factors. This article proposes a
novel transparent data-driven method for territorial division based on the
Voronoi partition of edge-weighted road graphs and the vertex $k$-center
problem as a special case of the minimax facility location problem. By
considering road network structure and strategic placement of administrative
centers, this method seeks to minimize travel time disparities and ensure a
more balanced distribution of administrative time burden for the population. We
show implementations of this approach in the context of Latvia, a country with
complex geographical features and diverse population distribution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A stable cutset is a set of vertices $S$ of a connected graph, that is
pairwise non-adjacent and when deleting $S$, the graph becomes disconnected.
Determining the existence of a stable cutset in a graph is known to be
NP-complete. In this paper, we introduce a new exact algorithm for Stable
Cutset. By branching on graph configurations and using the $O^*(1.3645)$
algorithm for the (3,2)-Constraint Satisfaction Problem presented by Beigel and
Eppstein, we achieve an improved running time of $O^*(1.2972^n)$.
  In addition, we investigate the Stable Cutset problem for graphs with a bound
on the minimum degree $\delta$. First, we show that if the minimum degree of a
graph $G$ is at least $\frac{2}{3}(n-1)$, then $G$ does not contain a stable
cutset. Furthermore, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for graphs where
$\delta \geq \tfrac{1}{2}n$, and a similar kernelisation algorithm for graphs
where $\delta = \tfrac{1}{2}n - k$.
  Finally, we prove that Stable Cutset remains NP-complete for graphs with
minimum degree $c$, where $c > 1$. We design an exact algorithm for this
problem that runs in $O^*(\lambda^n)$ time, where $\lambda$ is the positive
root of $x^{\delta + 2} - x^{\delta + 1} + 6$. This algorithm can also be
applied to the \textsc{3-Colouring} problem with the same minimum degree
constraint, leading to an improved exact algorithm as well.

Abstract: For a phylogenetic tree, the phylogenetic diversity of a set A of taxa is the
total weight of edges on paths to A. Finding small sets of maximal diversity is
crucial for conservation planning, as it indicates where limited resources can
be invested most efficiently. In recent years, efficient algorithms have been
developed to find sets of taxa that maximize phylogenetic diversity either in a
phylogenetic network or in a phylogenetic tree subject to ecological
constraints, such as a food web. However, these aspects have mostly been
studied independently. Since both factors are biologically important, it seems
natural to consider them together. In this paper, we introduce decision
problems where, given a phylogenetic network, a food web, and integers k, and
D, the task is to find a set of k taxa with phylogenetic diversity of at least
D under the maximize all paths measure, while also satisfying viability
conditions within the food web. Here, we consider different definitions of
viability, which all demand that a "sufficient" number of prey species survive
to support surviving predators. We investigate the parameterized complexity of
these problems and present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms.
Specifically, we provide a complete complexity dichotomy characterizing which
combinations of parameters - out of the size constraint k, the acceptable
diversity loss D, the scanwidth of the food web, the maximum in-degree in the
network, and the network height h - lead to W[1]-hardness and which admit FPT
algorithms. Our primary methodological contribution is a novel algorithmic
framework for solving phylogenetic diversity problems in networks where
dependencies (such as those from a food web) impose an order, using a color
coding approach.

Conclusion: 对单机带重启的加权最大完工时间最小化问题在不同情况下的确定性在线算法竞争比有了更清晰的边界。

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the weighted makespan on a single
machine with restarts. Restarts are similar to preemptions but weaker: a job
can be interrupted, but then it has to be run again from the start instead of
resuming at the point of interruption later. The objective is to minimize the
weighted makespan, defined as the maximum weighted completion time of jobs.
  We establish a lower bound of 1.4656 on the competitive ratio achievable by
deterministic online algorithms. For the case where all jobs have identical
processing times, we design and analyze a deterministic online algorithm that
improves the competitive ratio to better than 1.3098. Finally, we prove a lower
bound of 1.2344 for this case.

Conclusion: 竞买人不确定性改变了顺序拍卖的均衡结果，对不同价值竞买人和拍卖人产生不同影响。

Abstract: Sequential auctions for identical items with unit-demand, private-value
buyers are common and often occur periodically without end, as new bidders
replace departing ones. We model bidder uncertainty by introducing a
probability that a bidder must exit the auction in each period. Treating the
sequential auction as a Markov process, we demonstrate the existence of a
unique steady state.
  In the absence of uncertainty, the steady state resembles a posted-price
mechanism: bidders with values above a threshold almost surely win items by
repeatedly bidding the threshold price, while those below the threshold almost
surely do not. The equilibrium price corresponds to the threshold value that
balances supply (bidders with values above the threshold) and demand (auction
winners).
  When uncertainty is introduced, the threshold value persists but becomes less
precise, growing "fuzzier" as uncertainty increases. This uncertainty benefits
low-value bidders, those below the threshold, by giving them a significant
chance of winning. Surprisingly, high-value bidders also benefit from
uncertainty, up to a certain value limit, as it lowers equilibrium bids and
increases their expected utility. On the other hand, this bidder uncertainty
often reduces the auctioneer's utility.

Abstract: Managing millions of digital auctions is an essential task for modern
advertising auction systems. The main approach to managing digital auctions is
an autobidding approach, which depends on the Click-Through Rate and Conversion
Rate values. While these quantities are estimated with ML models, their
prediction uncertainty directly impacts advertisers' revenue and bidding
strategies. To address this issue, we propose RobustBid, an efficient method
for robust autobidding taking into account uncertainty in CTR and CVR
predictions. Our approach leverages advanced, robust optimization techniques to
prevent large errors in bids if the estimates of CTR/CVR are perturbed. We
derive the analytical solution of the stated robust optimization problem, which
leads to the runtime efficiency of the RobustBid method. The synthetic,
iPinYou, and BAT benchmarks are used in our experimental evaluation of
RobustBid. We compare our method with the non-robust baseline and the RiskBid
algorithm in terms of total conversion volume (TCV) and average cost-per-click
($CPC_{avg}$) performance metrics. The experiments demonstrate that RobustBid
provides bids that yield larger TCV and smaller $CPC_{avg}$ than competitors in
the case of large perturbations in CTR/CVR predictions.

Result: 在Yelp评论有用性预测任务中表明，数据估值本身会产生明确的获取成本，且数据联盟的集体披露政策会改变成本在成员间的分配。

Conclusion: 数据估值存在获取成本，数据联盟的披露政策影响成本分配。

Abstract: Data valuation methods assign marginal utility to each data point that has
contributed to the training of a machine learning model. If used directly as a
payout mechanism, this creates a hidden cost of valuation, in which
contributors with near-zero marginal value would receive nothing, even though
their data had to be collected and assessed. To better formalize this cost, we
introduce a conceptual and game-theoretic model, the Information Disclosure
Game, between a Data Union (sometimes also called a data trust), a member-run
agent representing contributors, and a Data Consumer (e.g., a platform). After
first aggregating members' data, the DU releases information progressively by
adding Laplacian noise under a differentially-private mechanism. Through
simulations with strategies guided by data Shapley values and multi-armed
bandit exploration, we demonstrate on a Yelp review helpfulness prediction task
that data valuation inherently incurs an explicit acquisition cost and that the
DU's collective disclosure policy changes how this cost is distributed across
members.

Abstract: In a typical \emph{billboard advertisement} technique, a number of digital
billboards are owned by an \emph{influence provider}, and several commercial
houses approach the influence provider for a specific number of views of their
advertisement content on a payment basis. If the influence provider provides
the demanded or more influence, then he will receive the full payment else a
partial payment. In the context of an influence provider, if he provides more
or less than the advertisers demanded influence, it is a loss for him. This is
formalized as 'Regret', and naturally, in the context of the influence
provider, the goal will be to allocate the billboard slots among the
advertisers such that the total regret is minimized. In this paper, we study
this problem as a discrete optimization problem and propose two solution
approaches. The first one selects the billboard slots from the available ones
in an incremental greedy manner, and we call this method the Budget Effective
Greedy approach. In the second one, we introduce randomness in the first one,
where we do it for a sample of slots instead of calculating the marginal gains
of all the billboard slots. We analyze both algorithms to understand their time
and space complexity. We implement them with real-life datasets and conduct a
number of experiments. We observe that the randomized budget effective greedy
approach takes reasonable computational time while minimizing the regret.

TL;DR: 现有RAG系统查询扩展方法忽视用户特定语义，提出PBR框架解决个性化挑战，实验显示其优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统查询扩展方法采用统一策略，忽略用户特定语义，无法在个性化场景有效泛化。

Method: 提出PBR框架，包含P - PRF模拟用户表达风格、P - Anchor捕获用户语料结构，生成个性化查询表示。

Result: 在两个个性化基准测试中，PBR始终优于强基线，在PersonaBench上检索器最高有10%的提升。

Conclusion: 在检索前进行个性化建模对缩小用户自适应RAG系统语义差距有价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query
expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods
adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring
individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,
identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.
This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to
generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two
core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently
diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized
intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in
topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of
expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,
we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates
user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of
two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback
using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which
performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its
structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored
for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR
consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench
across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling
personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG
systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.

Conclusion: SHERLOCK框架有效解决电商风险调查中的问题，提升分析精度和调查效率。

Abstract: The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial
dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies
often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging
fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc
governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial
workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of
long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk
dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the
establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these
challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk
investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1)
extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a
domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the
data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations,
and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment,
and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the
domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns.
Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both
factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results.
Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially
enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

Abstract: Document reranking is a key component in information retrieval (IR), aimed at
refining initial retrieval results to improve ranking quality for downstream
tasks. Recent studies--motivated by large reasoning models (LRMs)--have begun
incorporating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-based
rerankers. However, the effectiveness of such reasoning for ranking tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of
reasoning in reranking across both pointwise and listwise settings, under both
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Using diverse benchmarks,
including reasoning-intensive datasets (BRIGHT) and standard IR benchmarks
(BEIR), we find that reasoning-augmented rerankers consistently underperform
their direct counterparts that predict rankings without CoT, despite
substantially higher inference costs. Our analysis reveals three core
limitations: (i) in pointwise rerankers, reasoning breaks calibration and
biases models toward the positive class, raising TPR but lowering TNR, which
inflates false positives and degrades ranking in negative-dominant pools; (ii)
in listwise rerankers, reasoning improves in-domain fit but increases variance
and fails to generalize out-of-domain, even when reinforcement learning
shortens rationales; and (iii) overall, directly fine-tuned rerankers remain
more stable, effective, and robust. These findings challenge the assumption
that explicit reasoning is universally beneficial for reranking. We conclude by
highlighting future directions, including calibration-aware scoring for
pointwise rerankers and the design of concise, targeted reasoning strategies to
mitigate overfitting and overthinking in listwise rerankers.

Conclusion: GDA4Rec框架能生成高质量增强视图，提供鲁棒自监督信号，使模型学习到更有效和有信息的嵌入。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms,
from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain
is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While
contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this
issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most
existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of
original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for
Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust
self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that
leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original
data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item
complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and
provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that
integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used
to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of the model. The code is available at:

Method: 在一家挪威主要传统新闻机构网站进行A/B测试。

Conclusion: 受控个性化可成功协调用户需求和编辑目标，为传统媒体采用个性化技术同时坚持新闻价值提供可行途径。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendations have become a standard feature of large
news aggregation services, optimizing user engagement through automated content
selection. In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization
cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial
values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically
combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a
strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we
evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test
conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our
findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields
substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to
personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced
navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover,
our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater
content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias.
Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully
align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media
to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的推荐系统因推荐中存在的巨大、动态动作空间而面临稳定策略学习的重大挑战，需解决此瓶颈。

Method: 引入HSRL，在固定语义动作空间上进行基于强化学习的推荐；使用Hierarchical Policy Network以粗到细方式操作，采用分层残差状态建模；使用Multi - level Critic提供细粒度价值估计。

Result: 在公共基准和大型生产数据集上，HSRL始终超越最先进的基线；线上7天A/B测试中，转化率提升18.421%，成本仅增加1.251%。

Conclusion: HSRL是基于强化学习的推荐系统的可扩展范式。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While
most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has
begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.
However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic
action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.
To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which
reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL
encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to
their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align
decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)
operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state
modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,
thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In
parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,
enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a
large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising
platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online
deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with
only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for
RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at

Result: 在淘宝平台离线评估中GAUC提高1.16%，在线A/B测试订单量增加7.24%。

Conclusion: ChoirRec框架在提升低活跃用户CVR预测方面有显著实用价值。

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a
fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing
approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and
unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to
the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward
high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address
these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the
semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic
user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a
dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer,
ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module
that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby
filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation
module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors
to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity
Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism
to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct
extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale
e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations,
while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume,
highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

Method: 构建含1502个跨23个领域查询的MRMR基准，对4类多模态检索系统和14个前沿模型进行评估。

Result: 文本嵌入模型Qwen3 - Embedding结合大语言模型生成的图像描述表现最佳，最新多模态模型在推理密集型任务表现不佳。

Conclusion: MRMR为多模态检索在更现实和具挑战性场景的发展奠定基础。

Abstract: We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal
retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries
spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human
experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements.
First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise,
enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are
reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as
diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a
novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries
and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike
earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR
offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus
documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal
retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model
Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest
performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval
models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform
competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive
tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in
more realistic and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Doc2Query++能有效解决现有文档扩展方法的局限，提升检索性能。

Abstract: Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in
sparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing
hallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from
in-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise
from concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and
taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE
framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's
latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability,
then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword
set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure
comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through
diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense
retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query
signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show
Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on
both sparse and dense retrieval.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型安全对齐技术常使模型过度谨慎，拒绝良性提示，目标是增强安全性同时减少误拒。

Method: 引入 EDS 框架，训练轻量级外部基于能量模型 (EBM) 给不同状态分配能量，推理时将模型内部激活映射到“能量景观”，用能量函数梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域。

Result: 在多个模型上实验，显著降低误拒率，如将 ORB - H 基准的合规率从 57.3% 提高到 82.6%，并保持基线安全性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建低误拒率和高安全性的大语言模型提供有效范式。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

Method: 提出WILSON，将内部表示的简单循环和重排序检查转换为系统信号，结合逆自由曲率图和激活级换向器。

Result: WILSON计算成本低、模型无关，能输出阈值和CSV工件，可用于防范RAG顺序效应、捕捉微调回归等。

Conclusion: WILSON可在不改变模型架构和训练的情况下，帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使可靠性和吞吐量共同提升。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational

Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active

intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上实现有竞争力且稳健的致病基因预测，与其他框架集成时有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据，使复杂遗传分析更普及，对缺乏先进基因组基础设施的弱势群体有重要价值。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

*Yihao Ang,Peicheng Yao,Yifan Bao,Yushuo Feng,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Zhiyong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RFOD框架用于表格数据离群值检测，在15个真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格数据离群值检测方法处理混合类型数据时丢失语义信息且缺乏可解释性，需改进。

Method: 将异常检测重构为特征条件重建问题，为每个特征训练随机森林，结合调整后的高尔距离进行单元格评分，用不确定性加权平均聚合为行级异常分数。

Result: 在15个真实数据集上，RFOD检测准确性始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RFOD对混合类型表格数据具有更好的鲁棒性、可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

TL;DR: 现实世界时间序列有非平稳特性，现有归一化方法未考虑个体实例内偏移，提出LD和LCD两种点级方法并验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实时间序列的非平稳性导致分布偏移影响模型性能，现有方法未考虑个体实例内偏移，性能不佳。

Method: 提出Learning Distribution (LD)和Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD)两种点级方法，LD用不同参数拟合输入输出内部分布消除差异，LCD用神经网络预测输出缩放系数。

Result: 在公共基准上用多种骨干模型评估两种方法，通过对比实验证明点级范式有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的LD和LCD方法能有效处理时间序列个体实例内分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架用于实时多视图3D重建，在动态环境平衡延迟和重建质量，提高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘资源可用性的动态和不可预测性给实时多视图3D重建带来干扰，影响重建可靠性。

Method: 采用两个合作的Q学习代理分别进行相机和服务器选择，完全在线操作；搭建分布式测试平台模拟现实场景。

Result: 框架在动态环境中有效平衡端到端延迟和重建质量，提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架可在资源受限和易受干扰环境中确保高质量3D重建。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有基于LeFMs的少样本分类器易受中毒攻击，现有防御策略缺乏形式化保证，可证明鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 提出LeFCert，集成文本和特征嵌入与自适应混合机制，提出双重修剪均值原型并推导分类分数上下界；还扩展出LeFCert-L和LeFCert-C两个变体。

Result: LeFCert达到了最先进的性能，相比现有基线显著提高了干净和认证准确率，且计算高效。

Conclusion: LeFCert能有效解决基于LeFMs的少样本分类器中毒攻击问题，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有数据投影质量指标归一化应力和KL散度对缩放敏感，影响维度约简技术评估。

Result: 展示了缩放对指标值的影响，新技术在小基准上准确捕捉预期行为。

Conclusion: 提出的技术可使质量指标尺度不变，有助于更准确评估维度约简技术。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于评估实践不一致，EHR数据的最佳表示方法尚不明确，需要进行系统比较。

Method: 提出系统基准，在两个临床场景（MIMIC - IV数据集用于ICU任务，EHRSHOT数据集用于纵向护理）下标准化数据管理和评估，评估多种建模族并分析特征修剪的影响。

Result: 事件流模型表现始终最佳；预训练模型在少样本场景高效，数据充足时简单计数模型也有竞争力；特征选择策略需适应临床场景。

Conclusion: 基于统一且可复现的流程，为根据临床背景和数据状况选择EHR表示提供实用指导。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实证展示了方法的特性。

Conclusion: 所提框架和方法能解决协作数据共享中各方不同时间加入及激励问题。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CATS - Linear模型在时间序列预测上有较好性能，为线性模型的提升提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Conclusion: FedL2T是隐私敏感医疗场景下癫痫预测可靠且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Result: 大量离线实验和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能挖掘训练好的CTR模型的预测潜力，减轻低置信度特征对最终预测的影响。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效降低扩散变压器推理成本，提高效率。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，使用Llama - 3.1 - 8B和Qwen - 2.5 - 3B，LENS始终优于GRPO基线，在难题上提升显著。

Conclusion: LENS是一种在RLVR中“拯救”负样本组、提高效率和性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn

Conclusion: SHAP分析及聚类SHAP值的方法能有效解释模型预测，新的多分类瀑布图推广有一定价值。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Conclusion: 正交对齐因改善缩放定律自然出现，研究结果为多模态研究中参数高效扩展提供新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

Conclusion: CF - CP为反事实公平的不确定性量化提供简单、无需训练的途径。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Result: 得出思想向量和矩阵，为现有模型编辑技术提供理论解释，给出将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的方法。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型内部状态修改技术提供了理论基础和新的计算方法。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

Conclusion: 该框架将干扰转化为多原因信号，连接了空间和去混杂文献，推动了结构化数据中稳健的因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

Result: 联邦学习模型会记忆客户端数据，尤其是客户端内数据，且受训练和推理因素影响。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效量化联邦学习中的记忆化。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

Result: 标准优化器能收敛到损失表面局部最小值，保留原量化损失全局最小值，在合成测试台和大参数语言模型上优于标准QAT。

Conclusion: LOTION框架在量化目标优化中有效，有良好收敛性和性能表现。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Conclusion: 该框架灵活，集成虚拟成像与强化学习用于CT协议管理有潜力。

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to

the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two

TL;DR: 提出通过增强观察空间提供大语言模型（LLM）生成的动作建议的框架，在BabyAI环境评估显示可提升强化学习（RL）训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统探索策略在稀疏奖励环境中使RL代理难以发现有效动作序列，现有结合LLM与RL的方法存在刚性依赖问题。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，利用软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境评估，LLM指导效果随任务难度增加，最具挑战性环境最终成功率相对提升71%，样本效率最多提升9倍，无需修改现有RL算法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效利用LLM规划能力加速挑战性环境中的RL训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于基函数预训练的可重用初始化框架用于神经网络函数逼近，提升训练效率、泛化性和模型可迁移性，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于神经网络的函数逼近模型训练时需从头训练、性能对架构和超参数敏感、泛化性差等问题。

Method: 先训练基神经网络在参考域上逼近多项式族，用其学习的参数初始化更复杂目标函数的网络，引入域映射机制将输入转换到参考域。

Result: 在一维和二维设置的大量数值实验中，训练效率、泛化性和模型可迁移性有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略对可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近有前景。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效学习物理上一致的时空解算子，实现对参数时变偏微分方程的快速预测。

Method: 采用DeepONet架构，融入CKAN子网络进行函数近似，结合PINNs原理保证物理一致性，通过PDE残差损失强制物理一致性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准问题上验证，结果与高保真解匹配；在Burgers方程上比PI - DeepONet降低约48%的平均相对L2误差，在Eikonal和扩散 - 反应基准上有有竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: PO - CKAN能准确学习算子，有效处理参数时变偏微分方程。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Method: 提出TAPAS数据集。

Result: 创建了TAPAS数据集，建立了攻击性能基线。

Conclusion: 为未来关于LWE攻击的AI研究指明了方向。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out

Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略且假设模态输入始终可靠，与现实学习环境不符，需更好方法提升在线教育参与度和个性化教学。

Method: 引入Edu - EmotionNet框架，包含CMAA模块用于动态跨模态上下文共享、MIE为各模态分配基于置信度的权重、TFL利用先前预测保证时间一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI教育子集上达到了最先进的性能，对缺失或嘈杂模态有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Edu - EmotionNet能捕捉情感转变，自适应优先处理可靠信号，适合部署在实时学习系统中。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Conclusion: RepDL可解决深度学习中浮点计算的不一致问题，代码开源。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

Result: 在所有评估指标上都取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: 小语言模型对图结构数据有一定推理能力，可通过高效参数调优用于结构推理任务。

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Conclusion: 所提出的两阶段学习方法能有效缓解多数类偏差并保留数据集中的有价值信息。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test

tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

Conclusion: 强调需要针对所有形式偏差的整体方法，以及更稳健、公平的预后模型。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

Motivation: 虽CL损失近似NSCL损失，但不清楚训练中二者在表示层面是否对齐，故进行研究。

Method: 分析在共享随机性下训练的CL和NSCL模型的表示对齐，证明相似矩阵在现实条件下接近，给出对齐指标的高概率保证；同时研究参数空间耦合情况。

Result: CL和NSCL诱导表示相似，参数空间耦合不稳定，权重差异随训练时间指数增长；实证表明CL - NSCL对齐随规模和温度增强，NSCL比其他监督目标更接近CL。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督和监督学习之间有原则的桥梁。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器（SAEs）训练方法存在特征吸收问题，难以识别和分析模型行为，需要新方法解决。

Method: 引入Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM)方法，通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重建贡献计算重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制进行特征选择。

Result: 在Gemma - 2 - 2b模型上实验显示，ATM比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs等现有方法吸收分数显著降低，且保持良好重建质量。

Conclusion: ATM是学习神经网络中稳定、可解释特征的有效解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Conclusion: SCA能更好捕捉视觉系统潜在神经调谐特征，提供了一种对神经调谐底层轴敏感的表征对齐度量方法。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie

TL;DR: 当前RLVR方法难平衡探索与利用，引入ACPO框架解决问题，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法难以平衡探索与利用，导致信用分配不准确和熵过早崩溃，限制模型性能。

Method: 引入包含难度感知课程的分阶段框架ACPO，利用轨迹语义分割和基于归因的表示调节策略熵，用分解奖励系统增强利用。

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACPO能有效解决现有RLVR方法的问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 解决车联网半持久调度中数据包冲突和车速相关信道不确定性导致的信息年龄恶化问题。

Method: 建立受车速、车辆密度和资源预留间隔影响的信息年龄计算模型，设计双路径优化方案，DDPG由状态空间和奖励函数引导，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低信息年龄，DDPG训练后性能更稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的基于LLM和DDPG的优化方法能有效应对车联网半持久调度中的问题。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

TL;DR: 提出针对时空相关小地球数据的预测方法，经对比该方法在多数情况下比其他模型更准确且稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型需针对不同场景进行特定训练，基础模型有预测偏差，需为小地球数据的时空预测找到更好方法。

Method: 表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，利用表格基础模型进行不同场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景的对比结果中，该预测方法在多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T - GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）有更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有优越性和更强的稳健性。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Result: 通过综合数值结果，证明AB - PINNs在解决多种复杂多尺度偏微分方程方面有效。

Conclusion: AB - PINNs是一种灵活的域分解方法，适用于多尺度问题，能避免收敛到局部极小值和减少超参数调整。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Motivation: 传统证据深度学习方法依赖静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布中适应性差，在高风险决策任务中校准和泛化能力不佳。

Method: 提出Meta - Policy Controller (MPC)动态元学习框架，采用双层优化方法，内循环通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数，外循环用策略网络优化KL散度系数和特定类别的狄利克雷先验强度。

Result: MPC显著提升了模型在各种任务中预测的可靠性和校准能力，改善了不确定性校准、预测准确性，以及基于置信度样本拒绝后的性能保留。

Conclusion: MPC框架能够有效解决传统EDL方法的局限性，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Result: 在电器能源、医疗保健和环境监测等不同数据集领域，VARNN性能优越，测试均方误差更低，计算开销小。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下能提供稳健预测，是有前景的时间序列学习框架。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Result: 在九个场景实验中，LAGA提升了图质量，在各种任务和骨干网络上取得了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 以数据为中心的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和稳健图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了高维序列表示学习和高效贝叶斯优化之间的差距，可在更多领域应用。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture
search materials science and beyond.

Conclusion: 学习型优化器可固有地学习正则化属性，挑战了显式优化器损失正则化的传统必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

Result: RLER比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，能在无标注样本上稳定扩展。

Conclusion: RLER方法效果良好，具有高适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了通用基础，能实现更高效、符合约束且适应领域的大语言模型规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Result: 在多个移动平台上评估，能显著降低搜索开销，识别出的模型在准确率和效率上优于MobileNet - V2。

Conclusion: PlatformX是一个能克服现有HW - NAS方法局限的全自动、可转移的框架。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

Conclusion: SQS框架能在保证性能的同时实现更高压缩率，适用于资源受限设备上的模型部署。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型去学习方法多假设遗忘数据干净明确，但现实中数据可能质量低、改写或加水印，需研究噪声遗忘集下的去学习。

Result: 只要保留核心语义信号，去学习对扰动仍有较强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 去学习算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出Slim Scheduler混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习策略与贪心调度器，协调可瘦身模型的分布式推理，相比随机任务分配基线有更好的性能表现。

Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究多关注静态、固定宽度模型，忽视适应异构硬件和波动运行条件的动态方法。

Method: 提出Slim Scheduler混合调度框架，服务器运行本地贪心调度器处理请求和实例缩放，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，可实现多种精度和延迟权衡，如大幅降低平均延迟和能耗，同时能在提高精度的情况下降低平均延迟和能耗总和。

Conclusion: Slim Scheduler的分层设计降低搜索空间复杂度，减轻对特定硬件的过拟合，平衡了效率和吞吐量。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从头配体设计研究存在“伪从头”、“有限对接建模”和“配体类型不灵活”等问题。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架融入对接知识指导配体生成；强调可微表面建模，用可学习的3D点云表示捕捉结合细节；针对不同配体类型定制设计并集成到统一框架。

Result: 在9种场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock在蛋白质和分子配体设计上分别比SOTA基线平均提高27.1%和11.7%。

Conclusion: MagicDock能有效解决现有从头配体设计研究的问题，具有良好性能和广泛适用性。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

Result: 显卡生产影响稳步上升，ML模型训练能耗和环境影响指数级增长，优化策略未减轻影响。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率不能确保ML可持续，需减少AI活动并审视资源密集型训练规模和频率。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

Motivation: 指出当前针对越狱和提示注入的语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，需改进评估方式。

Method: 系统调整和扩展通用优化技术，如梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索。

Result: 绕过12种近期防御，多数攻击成功率超90%，而原多数防御报告攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来防御工作必须考虑更强攻击以提出可靠且有说服力的鲁棒性主张。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

Method: 基于边缘稳定性现象，分析不同优化器作为特征值过滤器的特性，利用广义Hadamard - Perron稳定流形定理进行理论分析。

Result: 提出两种具有增强特征值过滤能力、能有效促进更宽最小值的新算法。

Conclusion: 新算法在前馈神经网络的数值实验中得到验证。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

Motivation: 现有DRL在自动驾驶中虽有成效，但易受对抗攻击，现有鲁棒方法存在应对策略威胁能力有限、难致严重安全事件、训练不稳定和策略漂移等问题。

Method: 提出IGCARL方法，包含战略目标对手和鲁棒驾驶代理，对手执行多步攻击并聚焦安全关键事件，代理在约束公式下优化学习。

Result: IGCARL较现有方法成功率至少提高27.9%。

Conclusion: IGCARL对对抗攻击有更强鲁棒性，提升了基于DRL的自动驾驶安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Conclusion: 分割技术可减少时间模糊性，促进监督算法学习，未来计划引入加权特征进一步优化模型。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Motivation: CTC - based ASR系统在资源受限环境有计算和内存瓶颈，传统CTC解码器效率低。

Method: 引入Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP CTC)算法，通过相对阈值概率进行帧级令牌剪枝，动态消除低概率令牌。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上，与标准CTC解码器相比，实现10.5倍的运行时加速和2.78倍的内存减少。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC解决了CTC瓶颈，适用于资源受限环境和实时应用，提高了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Conclusion: AdaPM能在多种模型训练中有效减少内存，同时保持效率和性能。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Conclusion: 所提方法可增强差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Conclusion: 该框架为大语言模型领域适配提供可扩展、与架构无关的方法，不牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path

TL;DR: 提出Agentic - KGR框架，通过多轮强化学习实现大语言模型与知识图谱协同进化，实验表明在知识提取和问答任务有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识增强大语言模型依赖静态预构建知识库，存在覆盖缺口和时效性问题，在动态信息环境中效果受限。

Method: 提出Agentic - KGR框架，包含动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统和可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法。

Result: 在知识提取任务上比监督基线和单轮强化学习方法有显著改进，与GraphRAG集成后在下游问答任务中准确性和知识覆盖度有显著提升。

Conclusion: Agentic - KGR框架有效，能实现大语言模型和知识图谱的协同进化，提升相关任务表现。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: AI发展下能耗和隐私问题受关注，设备端学习有挑战，提出WASI方法在子空间训练transformer模型，减少内存和计算成本，提升训练和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI发展带来能耗和隐私问题，设备端学习因神经网络规模扩大面临障碍，此前工作集中于卷积架构，要为transformer模型找新方法。

Method: 引入Weight - Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI)方法，将训练限制在固定子空间以缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈，提高推理效率。

Result: WASI与普通训练精度相当，降低内存使用最多62倍，减少计算成本最多2倍，在树莓派5上训练和推理速度快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法能在保证精度的同时，有效减少transformer模型训练的内存和计算成本，提升训练和推理速度。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Motivation: 深入研究Git Re - Basin这一新颖的模型合并方法。

Method: 提出分层模型合并方案。

Result: 新算法表现优于标准MergeMany算法；Re - Basin使合并模型具有对抗和扰动鲁棒性，参与合并的模型越多效果越强；实验中Re - Basin导致的性能下降比原作者报告的大。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FBN建模依赖局部成对交互，难捕捉高阶依赖，当前超图建模有计算负担和启发式问题，无法直接从数据分布进行端到端学习。

Method: 提出全局约束导向的多分辨率（GCM）FBN结构学习框架，纳入4种全局约束以实现4种不同建模分辨率的FBN结构学习。

Result: 在5个数据集和2个任务设置中，与9个基线和10个最先进方法相比，GCM相对准确率提高30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%，实验验证各组件贡献和可解释性。

Conclusion: 为FBN结构学习提供新视角，为认知神经科学跨学科应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Result: backGP方法比梯度投影方法平均减少10.8%的遗忘，提高12.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗攻击是灾难性遗忘的原因，backGP方法能有效减少遗忘和提高准确率。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法局限于文本，无法充分发挥MLLMs潜力。

Method: 提出Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO) 框架，通过保对齐更新进行多模态提示联合优化，利用贝叶斯选择策略指导候选提示选择。

Result: 在图像、视频和分子等多种模态实验中，MPO优于领先的仅文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现MLLMs潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Motivation: Flow Matching（FM）在离线模仿学习中虽能克隆专家行为，但缺乏环境交互和探索，在线优化有梯度计算不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 让简单MLP结构的学生策略通过含教师FM模型信息的奖励模型经RL算法在线更新，用教师FM模型正则化学生策略行为。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法显著提升了学习效率、泛化性和鲁棒性，尤其是从次优专家数据学习时。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了FM在线优化问题，能更好地利用专家数据进行学习。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions

introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Conclusion: 合成离群值可改善金融机器学习模型在中亚和高加索地区面对不可预见冲击时的稳定性。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Conclusion: 该方法可有效替代代数环，减少仿真时间并保证精度。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Conclusion: 该框架为利益相关者提供了可扩展且易获取的途径，以在快速发展的大语言模型生态系统中实施安全措施。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Conclusion: 该框架能实现对生成模型更可靠且经济有效的人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Motivation: softmax注意力复杂度高限制可扩展性，线性替代方案如SSMs信息处理差异不明，需深入理解。

Method: 利用动力系统框架将softmax、范数和线性注意力表示为动力系统，分析特征值谱，并进行广泛实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响记忆和长距离依赖建模，揭示与任务要求相符的光谱特征，架构修改会影响特征值谱和任务性能。

Conclusion: 特征值分析可作为解释、理解和提升序列模型能力的原则性指标。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

TL;DR: 提出感知驱动的CL框架CHUCKLE用于情感识别，提升了训练效率和模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别的CL方法常忽略人类感知难度，而这在情感识别这类主观任务中很关键。

Method: 提出CHUCKLE框架，利用众包数据集中的标注者一致性和对齐来定义样本难度。

Result: CHUCKLE使LSTM相对平均准确率提高6.56%，Transformer提高1.61%，同时减少梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE能提升训练效率和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在提升大语言模型思维链推理能力时，面临任务难度超模型能力导致奖励稀疏、训练低效，且使用离策略数据易误导策略更新的问题。

Method: 引入量化指标Affinity监测探索效率和训练稳定性，提出自适应提示框架HINT，提供启发式提示引导模型自主寻找解决方案。

Result: 在数学推理任务的大量实验中，HINT始终优于现有方法，在不同规模模型上取得了最优结果，学习更稳定，数据效率更高。

Conclusion: HINT是提升大语言模型思维链推理能力的有效方法，代码已在Github上开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 框架解释了近期设计的成功，为新序列模型架构设计提供指导原则。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决跨接收器变化问题，确保RFFI模型在接收器更换时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Conclusion: 研究结果为时间图学习模型应用提供实用见解，推动更注重可解释性的评估。

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Conclusion: 连接经典初始化原理与现代变压器行为，给出实用训练方法。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Motivation: 连接深度一类分类和密度估计这两种广泛研究的无监督异常检测范式，提升异常检测的理论理解和实际性能。

Method: 理论证明训练 USF 可转化为有独特正则化的 Deep SVDD 目标，实证用 USFs 替代非 USFs 进行异常检测。

Result: USFs 继承了流的密度忠实性和一类方法的基于距离推理特性，诱导负对数似然和潜在范数更紧密对齐，用 USFs 替代非 USFs 能在多个基准和模型骨干上取得一致性能提升和显著改善训练稳定性。

Conclusion: USFs 统一了两种主要的异常检测范式，在理论理解和实际性能上都有推进，建议在现代异常检测架构中用 USFs 替代非 USFs。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Motivation: 现有AI控制协议多基于LLM监控器，可能成为单点故障，需研究了解其在面对已知协议和监控模型的自适应攻击时的安全性。

Method: 研究已知协议和监控模型的不受信任模型的自适应攻击，通过在模型输出中嵌入已知或零样本提示注入实现攻击。

Result: 前沿模型在两个主要AI控制基准测试中持续逃避各种监控器并完成恶意任务，攻击对依赖监控器的当前协议普遍有效，Defer - to - Resample协议甚至会适得其反。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

Motivation: 现有基于物理和数据驱动的模型因数据异质性和观测样本有限，难以泛化到不同空间区域和尺度，需要解决此问题。

Method: 提出Geo - STARS框架，引入地理感知嵌入并集成到门控时空图神经网络，以学习复杂时空模式。

Result: 使用美国东海岸37年多流域的真实数据集评估，Geo - STARS在区域和尺度上的泛化性能优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Geo - STARS在可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策方面有应用前景。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated

Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出STaTS框架自适应压缩时间序列，实验表明其能达高效性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准表征学习流程未充分利用时间序列潜在结构，现有模型处理方式存在效率低、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限等问题。

Method: 使用基于BIC的统计发散准则检测多时间分辨率的变化点，用简单函数或生成模型总结各段。

Result: 实现高达30倍序列压缩，在150多个数据集实验中达全模型85 - 90%性能，降低计算成本，提高噪声下鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STaTS是高效、结构感知的时间序列建模通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Motivation: 生命科学动力系统行为机制过渡复杂且有噪声，传统流基建模技术难以应对。

Method: 提出MODE图形建模框架，用神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，能完成无监督分类和预测任务，处理单细胞RNA测序数据效果好。

Conclusion: MODE框架适合处理生命科学动力系统复杂行为机制过渡问题，可用于无监督发现和长期预测。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

TL;DR: 提出BaNEL算法，用失败尝试对模型进行后训练，减少奖励评估次数，在稀疏奖励任务上提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在重要问题的困难实例中，存在基础生成模型奖励信号接近零和奖励评估成本高的问题，与标准基于奖励的后训练面临不同学习挑战。

Method: 提出BaNEL算法，将学习失败规律问题转化为循环内生成建模问题，利用模型评估新数据是否类似先前失败数据并引导生成避开。

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务上不观察成功样本也能提升模型性能，成功率比现有新奇奖励方法高几个数量级，且奖励评估次数更少。

Conclusion: BaNEL算法能有效解决困难实例下生成模型的学习问题，提升性能并减少奖励评估成本。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Conclusion: 该框架能快速且精确地进行机翼设计，代码开源利于复现和社区发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework
for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while
ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of
initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several
algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method
(VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These
results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can
predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is
implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions
in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares
several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian
optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint
management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for
lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic
characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be
investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics
and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic
qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design
at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community
development, the complete implementation is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI能力受有限训练集和局部梯度信号学习的限制，常产生缺乏创造性的产物，而EC能拓展生成能力，因此要建立二者联系。

Method: 将EC重新定义为NatGenAI，对比经典EC和传统GenAI，利用进化多任务方法整合破坏性EC和适度选择机制。

Result: 经典EC与传统GenAI有相似之处，破坏性算子能实现结构化进化飞跃，进化多任务方法有助于持续创新。

Conclusion: 将EC重新定义为NatGenAI，强调结构化破坏和选择压力调节是创造力的关键驱动因素，可推动GenAI时代的探索性设计、创新等。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has achieved remarkable success across a range of
domains, but its capabilities remain constrained to statistical models of
finite training sets and learning based on local gradient signals. This often
results in artifacts that are more derivative than genuinely generative. In
contrast, Evolutionary Computation (EC) offers a search-driven pathway to
greater diversity and creativity, expanding generative capabilities by
exploring uncharted solution spaces beyond the limits of available data. This
work establishes a fundamental connection between EC and GenAI, redefining EC
as Natural Generative AI (NatGenAI) -- a generative paradigm governed by
exploratory search under natural selection. We demonstrate that classical EC
with parent-centric operators mirrors conventional GenAI, while disruptive
operators enable structured evolutionary leaps, often within just a few
generations, to generate out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, the methods
of evolutionary multitasking provide an unparalleled means of integrating
disruptive EC (with cross-domain recombination of evolved features) and
moderated selection mechanisms (allowing novel solutions to survive), thereby
fostering sustained innovation. By reframing EC as NatGenAI, we emphasize
structured disruption and selection pressure moderation as essential drivers of
creativity. This perspective extends the generative paradigm beyond
conventional boundaries and positions EC as crucial to advancing exploratory
design, innovation, scientific discovery, and open-ended generation in the
GenAI era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨QML和SNNs能否取代DNNs在AI领域的地位。

Method: 分析QML和SNNs面临的问题，如QML在反向传播适配、硬件等方面问题，SNNs在表征带宽、能耗等方面问题，并对比DNNs的优势。

Result: 近期模型如Grok - 4 Heavy、gpt - oss - 120b展现DNNs的优越性，QML和SNNs难在短期内取代DNNs。

Conclusion: QML和SNNs可起小众混合作用，DNNs仍是AI发展的主导实用范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in QML and SNNs have generated considerable excitement,
promising exponential speedups and brain-like energy efficiency to
revolutionize AI. However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace
DNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to
unitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and
high measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped
regularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine
learning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth,
struggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks
due to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of
faithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like
cognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their
touted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with
quantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions.
Finally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal
unfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust
regularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time
compute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while
mitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such
as xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which
surpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its
modest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU. Furthermore,
specialized ASICs amplify these efficiency gains. Ultimately, QML and SNNs may
serve niche hybrid roles, but DNNs remain the dominant, practical paradigm for
AI advancement.

Method: 提出DDEA框架，利用预训练DDMs进行种群初始化，使用基于扩散的重组算子，通过模仿学习训练。

Result: 在最大独立集问题上，DDEA优于DIFUSCO和Gurobi，在分布外实验中也表现更好，消融实验证明扩散初始化和重组都很关键。

Conclusion: 混合DDMs和EAs有潜力，为复杂组合优化问题的机器学习求解器发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a promising generative approach for
combinatorial optimization, yet they often lack the robust exploration
capabilities of traditional metaheuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework
that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs
for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel
diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against
an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem
on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO,
a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time
budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with
DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and
ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA
provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time
limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and
recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing
DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful
machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.

Conclusion: HyGO是适用于涉及参数和函数学习的广泛工程和科学问题的通用混合优化框架。

Abstract: The Hybrid Genetic Optimisation framework (HyGO) is introduced to meet the
pressing need for efficient and unified optimisation frameworks that support
both parametric and functional learning in complex engineering problems.
Evolutionary algorithms are widely employed as derivative-free global
optimisation methods but often suffer from slow convergence rates, especially
during late-stage learning. HyGO integrates the global exploration capabilities
of evolutionary algorithms with accelerated local search for robust solution
refinement. The key enabler is a two-stage strategy that balances exploration
and exploitation. For parametric problems, HyGO alternates between a genetic
algorithm and targeted improvement through a degradation-proof Dowhill Simplex
Method (DSM). For function optimisation tasks, HyGO rotates between genetic
programming and DSM. Validation is performed on (a) parametric optimisation
benchmarks, where HyGO demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than
standard genetic algorithms, and (b) function optimisation tasks, including
control of a damped Landau oscillator. Practical relevance is showcased through
aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, achieving consistently interpretable results and reductions
exceeding 20% by controlled jet injection in the back of the body for flow
reattachment and separation bubble reduction. Overall, HyGO emerges as a
versatile hybrid optimisation framework suitable for a broad spectrum of
engineering and scientific problems involving parametric and functional
learning.

Conclusion: 研究结果推动了AI基础设施去中心化和民主化讨论，指向更隐私友好的用户与设备交互未来。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者在使用版本约束指定项目依赖时，固定（pinning）和浮动（floating）各有优劣，且不同版本约束类型下依赖过时或易受攻击的可能性未知，需帮助开发者做决策。

Method: 先确定npm、PyPI和Cargo生态系统中依赖版本约束使用趋势和开发者更改版本约束类型的模式，再用生存分析建模依赖状态转换。

Result: 过时和易受攻击的依赖中，最常用的版本约束类型是floating - minor，其次是pinning；floating - major最不易导致依赖过时，floating - minor最不易导致依赖易受攻击。

Conclusion: 可通过实证评估不同版本约束类型下依赖状态变化，辅助开发者选择合适的依赖版本约束。

Abstract: Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable
versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can
reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually
managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other
hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security
fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners
advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain
attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the
tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in
outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or
vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The
goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency
version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of
dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at
scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version
constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by
developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the
dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the
likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning}
as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among
outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint
type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common.
We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in
outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable
dependencies.

Abstract: Code completion can help developers improve efficiency and ease the
development lifecycle. Although code completion is available in modern
integrated development environments (IDEs), research lacks in determining what
makes a good context for code completion based on the information available to
the IDEs for the large language models (LLMs) to perform better. In this paper,
we describe an effective context collection strategy to assist the LLMs in
performing better at code completion tasks. The key idea of our strategy is to
preprocess the repository into smaller code chunks and later use syntactic and
semantic similarity-based code chunk retrieval with relative positioning. We
found that code chunking and relative positioning of the chunks in the final
context improve the performance of code completion tasks.

and case studies. We outline the problem of collaboration hurdles in SDLC and
explore how LLMs can enhance productivity, communication, and decision-making
in a team context. Through literature review, industry examples, a team survey,
and two case studies, we assess the impact of LLM-assisted tools (such as code
generation assistants and AI-powered project management agents) on
collaborative software engineering practices. Our findings indicate that LLMs
can significantly improve efficiency (by automating repetitive tasks and
documentation), enhance communication clarity, and aid cross-functional
collaboration, while also introducing new challenges like model limitations and
privacy concerns. We discuss these benefits and challenges, present research
questions guiding the investigation, evaluate threats to validity, and suggest
future research directions including domain-specific model customization,
improved integration into development tools, and robust strategies for ensuring
trust and security.

*Ha Min Son,Huan Ren,Xin Liu,Zhe Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出AndroidBuildBench基准和GradleFixer代理解决安卓构建错误，展示工具桥接策略有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安卓自动构建有挑战，大语言模型修复安卓构建错误研究不足

Method: 引入AndroidBuildBench基准，提出GradleFixer代理及工具桥接策略

Result: GradleFixer解决率达81.4%，优于现有编码代理

Conclusion: 工具桥接策略能弥合模型高层推理和低层执行的差距

Abstract: Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building
applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a
benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43
open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution
from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose
GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and
manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate
of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent
that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that
while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they
struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a
general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term
Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware
abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it
provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it
constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the
gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.

TL;DR: 本文提出Faver中间件优化基于大语言模型的RTL生成，实验显示可提升模型生成准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的RTL生成因语义差距和数据不足，生成准确率低，且RTL测试台数据稀缺，模型处理与RTL语义差距大。

Method: 提出函数抽象可验证中间件Faver，将大语言模型友好的代码结构与基于规则的模板结合，解耦电路验证细节。

Result: 在SFT模型和开源模型实验中，Faver使模型生成准确率最高提升14%。

Conclusion: Faver可有效简化基于大语言模型工作流中的RTL验证，提升生成准确率。

Abstract: LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds
the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design.
However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications
and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with
generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification
helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more
scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level
languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When
implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ
significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to
consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level
details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we
propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines
RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures
with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit
verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our
experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's
generation accuracy by up to 14%.

TL;DR: 提出可控代码生成框架，采用多智能体协作架构，实验证明有效且安全率高，推理透明可增强用户信任和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的代码生成模型在复杂任务的安全、准确和可控性方面存在挑战，且缺乏动态工具集成、透明推理和用户安全控制。

Method: 提出利用ReAct范式进行多智能体任务执行的可控代码生成框架，包含规划器、搜索器、代码生成器和提取器四个专业智能体，搜索器交替生成推理轨迹和执行动作。

Result: 框架在多种语言上有效，在SVEN数据集上使用CodeQL的安全率达94.8%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 框架推理过程透明，能增强用户信任和可控性。

Abstract: Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide
adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and
controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack
dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control
over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation
framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This
framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and
interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and
external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture
comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a
Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration,
a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured
data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating
reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of
internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance
accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's
effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the
SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent
reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.

Motivation: 现代软件团队解决重复或相关问题时，因知识分散导致延迟，需解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出RAG框架，结合Sentence - Transformers进行语义嵌入和基于FAISS的向量搜索，嵌入历史数据检索相似案例，由LLM合成解决方案。

Result: 实验评估显示，该系统在现代DevOps环境中显著提高了解决准确性、修复质量和知识复用。

Conclusion: 所提出的RAG框架能有效解决软件团队问题解决延迟问题，提升各项指标。

Abstract: Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or
related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets,
developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this
challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that
integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based
vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The
approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata
to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a
Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution
suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and
GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous
software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved
evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time
reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system
significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in
modern DevOps environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在编码领域手动评估大模型生成内容质量极具挑战，需开发新评估平台。

Method: 基于Chatbot Arena构建BigCodeArena，收集代码对话数据，构建BigCodeReward和AutoCodeArena两个基准进行评估。

Result: 多数大模型在有执行结果时判断编码偏好表现更优，专有模型如GPT - 5等在代码生成性能领先。

Conclusion: BigCodeArena平台及相关基准有助于系统评估前沿大模型代码理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable
real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

Motivation: 搜索式测试生成算法配置选项多，用户常使用默认值，调优超参数资源需求高，需有效调参方法。

Method: 使用差分进化对Pynguin框架中DynaMOSA和MIO多目标搜索算法的超参数进行调优。

Result: 调优后的DynaMOSA算法可显著提高测试套件覆盖率，差分进化比基本网格搜索更高效。

Conclusion: 差分进化是一种有效调优搜索式测试生成算法超参数的方法。

Abstract: Search-based test-generation algorithms have countless configuration options.
Users rarely adjust these options and usually stick to the default values,
which may not lead to the best possible results. Tuning an algorithm's
hyperparameters is a method to find better hyperparameter values, but it
typically comes with a high demand of resources. Meta-heuristic search
algorithms -- that effectively solve the test-generation problem -- have been
proposed as a solution to also efficiently tune parameters. In this work we
explore the use of differential evolution as a means for tuning the
hyperparameters of the DynaMOSA and MIO many-objective search algorithms as
implemented in the Pynguin framework. Our results show that significant
improvement of the resulting test suite's coverage is possible with the tuned
DynaMOSA algorithm and that differential evolution is more efficient than basic
grid search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动库迁移耗时易错，现有自动化技术多停留在API映射阶段或支持库和代码转换有限。

Method: 先在321个真实库迁移基准上研究大语言模型用于库迁移的能力，然后开发结合大语言模型、静态分析和动态分析的命令行应用PyMigTool。

Result: 在717个非基准的真实Python应用上评估，PyMigTool能完全正确迁移32%的迁移任务，超半数项目中仅14%的迁移相关更改需开发者修复。

Conclusion: 开发的PyMigTool能有效实现任意Python库间的自动迁移。

Abstract: Library migration is the process of replacing a library with a similar one in
a software project. Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone,
as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces
(API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code
transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most
of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage
or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper,
we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between
any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due
to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code
generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration.
Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library
migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that
LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps
can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a
command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and
dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool
on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find
that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of
the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left
for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.

Motivation: LLM在长代码翻译中因上下文窗口限制，常产生不准确翻译。

Method: 提出一种结合标识符替换的零样本代码翻译方法，用通用占位符替换长标识符。

Result: 方法保留了代码的语法和层次信息，减少了翻译结果的令牌数量。

Conclusion: 该方法能降低令牌计数和内存使用，提高长代码翻译的效率和性价比。

Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate
tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language
is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs
often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window,
which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel
zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By
substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during
translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the
code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency
and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical
information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various

introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples
of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining
systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together
with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We
then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive
evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are
effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs
categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this
paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug
resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging
techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during
debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic
analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting
game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.

Motivation: 现代代码库使开发者和AI编码助手在查找文件时面临困难，传统代码搜索缺乏语义上下文和跨文件链接，大语言模型缺乏特定仓库细节。

Method: 用QLoRA和Unsloth优化微调Qwen3 - 8B，通过六种使用抽象语法树结构和仓库内容的代码感知策略构建训练数据。

Result: 在多个Python项目上取得高检索准确率，如最高91%精确匹配和93%召回率，在大型代码库如PyTorch上达到59%召回率。

Conclusion: 多级别代码信号有助于LLM推理跨文件上下文，讨论了数据集设计、局限性和未来与基于LLM的代码智能集成问题。

Abstract: Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find
the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature
work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or
IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large
language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific
detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong
LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file
paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we
introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST)
structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs,
where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file
prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine
tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch,
and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on
held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase
like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing
scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over
cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context
length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based
code intelligence.

combines semantic retrieval with graph-aware expansion, and an LLM-based
assistant formulates constrained, read-only graph requests and produces

Result: 在四个不同领域的软件项目上进行实验，使用Gemini 2.5推理模型生成的结果表明，该方法能准确识别不同领域的广泛可持续性问题。

Conclusion: SEER框架在早期软件开发阶段解决可持续性问题方面有效。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental,
technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable
practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are
time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus
on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at
the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a
framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software
development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies
sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from
a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are
based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that
fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning
capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from
different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately
identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.

Conclusion: 该系统化参考有助于软件开发人员和研究人员在可持续软件开发中有效制定、管理和协调权衡。

Abstract: Software systems are a significant contributor to global sustainability
concerns, demanding that environmental, social, technical, and economic factors
be systematically addressed from the initial requirements engineering phase.
Although existing research provides various sustainability requirements (SRs),
these contributions are often fragmented, specific to certain dimensions, or
limited to particular application domains, resulting in a critical lack of a
unified, comprehensive taxonomy for the software engineering community. To
address this gap, this research conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
to extract and organize sustainability requirements from the state-of-the-art.
The primary contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of SRs across the four
dimensions of sustainability (environmental, technical, social, and economic).
For each identified category, we provide clear definitions, associated metrics,
and measures. Furthermore, we depict a correlation matrix that projects the
positive and negative influences (synergies and conflicts) among categories
across different dimensions. This systematized reference assists both software
developers and researchers in effectively formulating, managing, and
reconciling trade-offs within sustainable software development.

Motivation: 现有评估软件工程代理的基准多源自GitHub问题，不能准确反映开发者在IDE中与聊天式编码助手的交互，会导致高估代理在现实场景中的能力。

Method: 通过系统分析开发者与聊天式代理的交互模式，将现有正式基准转换为现实用户查询，应用于多个基准。

Result: 现有基准对部分模型的代理能力高估，公共基准超50%，内部基准约10 - 16%。

Conclusion: 通过基准变异技术为评估交互式聊天式软件工程代理建立了新范式。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as
SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to
accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in
integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads
to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios,
especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that
transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through
systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents.
Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks.
In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the
TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and
transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries
based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our
findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent
capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public

Conclusion: 研究提供了从业者视角的大语言模型采用情况，为未来研究和软件工程中的合理使用提供关键考量。

Abstract: Large Language Models have quickly become a central component of modern
software development workflows, and software practitioners are increasingly
integrating LLMs into various stages of the software development lifecycle.
Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of
how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive
their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a
global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are
utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report
benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster
learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited
context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as
assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet
practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early,
practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key
considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.

Method: 提出literate tracing范式，它用带注释的具体执行轨迹解释软件系统；开发工具TReX制作交互式、可视化且符合程序语义的literate traces。

Result: 使用TReX为Linux内核、Git和GCC等大型系统软件组件编写了literate traces。

Conclusion: literate tracing范式及TReX工具可用于解释大型系统软件的工作原理。

Abstract: As computer systems grow ever larger and more complex, a crucial task in
software development is for one person (the system expert) to communicate to
another (the system novice) how a certain program works. This paper reports on
the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call
literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated,
concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both
in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs
(which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX,
our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and
guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have
used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems
software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC
compiler.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化测试生成工具未考虑ML API输入约束，导致测试提前失败和代码覆盖率低，需改进测试方法。

Method: 提出PynguinML方法，改进Pynguin测试生成器，利用从官方API文档提取的约束生成合规输入。

Result: 基于165个PyTorch和TensorFlow模块评估，PynguinML显著提升测试效果，代码覆盖率最高提升63.9%。

Conclusion: PynguinML能有效利用约束生成合规输入，实现更彻底的测试和更高的代码覆盖率。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are essential
for a wide range of modern applications. Ensuring the correctness of ML
libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict
input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated
test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and
often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and
limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from
official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach
that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to
generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and
higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and
TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that
PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 %
higher code coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字孪生应用缺乏统一且保护隐私的基础，个性化慢性病护理需整合多模态健康数据。

Method: 引入PMDT框架，用OWL 2.0实现，围绕模块化蓝图构建本体，通过专家研讨会、问卷调查和试点研究迭代完善验证。

Result: 证实本体覆盖度、推理正确性、可用性和GDPR合规性，能统一异构数据，支持多种分析。

Conclusion: PMDT填补数据碎片化和语义标准化差距，为数字健康生态提供基础，推动慢性病护理优化。

Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data
to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current
digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data
types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper
introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in
silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,
behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.
Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports
automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its
ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse
events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively
refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot
study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.
Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and
GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous
data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,
and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By
bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT
provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,
transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and
equitable management.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by
supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its
adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict
privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering
(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies
on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated
transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At
its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that
enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning
pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning
architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw
patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving
privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy
study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with
support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy
in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings
suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated
code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,
reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.

Motivation: 解决主流基于大语言模型的代码翻译方法存在对特定语言特征敏感、缺乏细粒度语义对齐的问题。

Method: 提出TIT范式，包含句法信息表示、细粒度并行数据集增强、双阶段树指令调优三个模块。

Result: 在多个大语言模型中显著优于现有方法，代码翻译成功率达1.22 - 1.75倍，减少句法混淆。

Conclusion: TIT范式有效提升基于大语言模型的代码翻译性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated
source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code
corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two
critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific
features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the
output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic
alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,
resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original
source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured
Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT
consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the
syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic
syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality
fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation
module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and
contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction
tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused
by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs
syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend
structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code
generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code
based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing
approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in
code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.

Motivation: 探索深度Q学习在标普500指数平值期权对冲中的应用，对比DRL代理与传统对冲方法的性能。

Method: 开发基于TD3算法的代理，使用历史日内价格训练，采用向前走程序，用多个指标评估，在不同市场条件下模拟并添加约束。

Result: DRL代理在波动或高成本环境中能超越传统对冲方法，但风险意识参数高时性能下降，波动率估计时间间隔越长结果越稳定。

Conclusion: DRL代理在实际交易中具有稳健性和灵活性，但受风险意识参数影响。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of deep Q-learning to hedging
at-the-money options on the S\&P~500 index. We develop an agent based on the
Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, trained to
simulate hedging decisions without making explicit model assumptions on price
dynamics. The agent was trained on historical intraday prices of S\&P~500 call
options across years 2004--2024, using a single time series of six predictor
variables: option price, underlying asset price, moneyness, time to maturity,
realized volatility, and current hedge position. A walk-forward procedure was
applied for training, which led to nearly 17~years of out-of-sample evaluation.
The performance of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent is benchmarked
against the Black--Scholes delta-hedging strategy over the same period. We
assess both approaches using metrics such as annualized return, volatility,
information ratio, and Sharpe ratio. To test the models' adaptability, we
performed simulations across varying market conditions and added constraints
such as transaction costs and risk-awareness penalties. Our results show that
the DRL agent can outperform traditional hedging methods, particularly in
volatile or high-cost environments, highlighting its robustness and flexibility
in practical trading contexts. While the agent consistently outperforms
delta-hedging, its performance deteriorates when the risk-awareness parameter
is higher. We also observed that the longer the time interval used for
volatility estimation, the more stable the results.

Result: GGFPS数据效率和鲁棒性优于FPS和均匀采样，能降低训练成本、减少预测误差和误差方差。

Conclusion: 梯度感知采样方法有望成为有效的训练集选择工具，盲目使用FPS可能导致训练不平衡和预测结果不一致。

Abstract: Smart training set selections procedures enable the reduction of data needs
and improves predictive robustness in machine learning problems relevant to
chemistry. We introduce Gradient Guided Furthest Point Sampling (GGFPS), a
simple extension of Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) that leverages molecular
force norms to guide efficient sampling of configurational spaces of molecules.
Numerical evidence is presented for a toy-system (Styblinski-Tang function) as
well as for molecular dynamics trajectories from the MD17 dataset. Compared to
FPS and uniform sampling, our numerical results indicate superior data
efficiency and robustness when using GGFPS. Distribution analysis of the MD17
data suggests that FPS systematically under-samples equilibrium geometries,
resulting in large test errors for relaxed structures. GGFPS cures this
artifact and (i) enables up to two fold reductions in training cost without
sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to FPS in the 2-dimensional
Styblinksi-Tang system, (ii) systematically lowers prediction errors for
equilibrium as well as strained structures in MD17, and (iii) systematically
decreases prediction error variances across all of the MD17 configuration
spaces. These results suggest that gradient-aware sampling methods hold great
promise as effective training set selection tools, and that naive use of FPS
may result in imbalanced training and inconsistent prediction outcomes.

Conclusion: 所提方法在合成数据集上有有竞争力的预测精度，大幅提高计算效率。

Abstract: The representer theorem is a cornerstone of kernel methods, which aim to
estimate latent functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) in a
nonparametric manner. Its significance lies in converting inherently
infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over
dual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable
algorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent
triggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between
events--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event
sequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of
penalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem
emerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of
simultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering
kernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels
evaluated at the data points. Remarkably, the dual coefficients are all
analytically fixed to unity, obviating the need to solve a costly optimization
problem to obtain the dual coefficients. This leads to a highly efficient
estimator capable of handling large-scale data more effectively than
conventional nonparametric approaches. Empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets reveal that the proposed method attains competitive predictive
accuracy while substantially improving computational efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimators.

Conclusion: 所提出的Mirror Flow Matching方法在凸域生成建模中有效，能解决现有方法的问题。

Abstract: We study generative modeling on convex domains using flow matching and mirror
maps, and identify two fundamental challenges. First, standard log-barrier
mirror maps induce heavy-tailed dual distributions, leading to ill-posed
dynamics. Second, coupling with Gaussian priors performs poorly when matching
heavy-tailed targets. To address these issues, we propose Mirror Flow Matching
based on a \emph{regularized mirror map} that controls dual tail behavior and
guarantees finite moments, together with coupling to a Student-$t$ prior that
aligns with heavy-tailed targets and stabilizes training. We provide
theoretical guarantees, including spatial Lipschitzness and temporal regularity
of the velocity field, Wasserstein convergence rates for flow matching with
Student-$t$ priors and primal-space guarantees for constrained generation,
under $\varepsilon$-accurate learned velocity fields. Empirically, our method
outperforms baselines in synthetic convex-domain simulations and achieves
competitive sample quality on real-world constrained generative tasks.

Conclusion: 所提贝叶斯框架能有效应对机器学习模型对抗攻击防御问题。

Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks remains a
critical security challenge. Traditional defenses, such as adversarial
training, typically robustify models by minimizing a worst-case loss. However,
these deterministic approaches do not account for uncertainty in the
adversary's attack. While stochastic defenses placing a probability
distribution on the adversary exist, they often lack statistical rigor and fail
to make explicit their underlying assumptions. To resolve these issues, we
introduce a formal Bayesian framework that models adversarial uncertainty
through a stochastic channel, articulating all probabilistic assumptions. This
yields two robustification strategies: a proactive defense enacted during
training, aligned with adversarial training, and a reactive defense enacted
during operations, aligned with adversarial purification. Several previous
defenses can be recovered as limiting cases of our model. We empirically
validate our methodology, showcasing the benefits of explicitly modeling
adversarial uncertainty.

Abstract: Transformer-based models for amortized probabilistic inference, such as
neural processes, prior-fitted networks, and tabular foundation models, excel
at single-pass marginal prediction. However, many real-world applications, from
signal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent
joint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely
autoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they
sacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for
meta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions
from set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented
conditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal
autoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our
approach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The
model processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures
target dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and
attend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables
efficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood
evaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of
set-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic
functions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches
predictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster
joint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive
generative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning,
making joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.

Abstract: Real-world clinical problems are often characterized by multimodal data,
usually associated with incomplete views and limited sample sizes in their
cohorts, posing significant limitations for machine learning algorithms. In
this work, we propose a Bayesian approach designed to efficiently handle these
challenges while providing interpretable solutions. Our approach integrates (1)
a generative formulation to capture cross-view relationships with a
semi-supervised strategy, and (2) a discriminative task-oriented formulation to
identify relevant information for specific downstream objectives. This dual
generative-discriminative formulation offers both general understanding and
task-specific insights; thus, it provides an automatic imputation of the
missing views while enabling robust inference across different data sources.
The potential of this approach becomes evident when applied to the multimodal
clinical data, where our algorithm is able to capture and disentangle the
complex interactions among biological, psychological, and sociodemographic
modalities.

Abstract: We propose a generative multivariate posterior sampler via flow matching. It
offers a simple training objective, and does not require access to likelihood
evaluation. The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the
joint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport
map from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named
vector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It
is advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the
velocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map,
enabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose
contours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach
is computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based
counterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.
Finally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered
posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is
provided.

Abstract: Estimating posteriors and the associated model evidences is a core issue of
Bayesian model inference, and can be of great challenge given complex features
of the posteriors such as multi-modalities of unequal importance, nonlinear
dependencies and high sharpness. Bayesian Quadrature (BQ) has emerged as a
competitive framework for tackling this challenge, as it provides flexible
balance between computational cost and accuracy. The performance of a BQ scheme
is fundamentally dictated by the acquisition function as it exclusively governs
the generation of integration points. After reexamining one of the most
advanced acquisition function from a prospective inference perspective and
reformulating the quadrature rules for prediction, four new acquisition
functions, inspired by distinct intuitions on expected rewards, are primarily
developed, all of which are accompanied by elegant interpretations and highly
efficient numerical estimators. Mathematically, these four acquisition
functions measure, respectively, the prediction uncertainty of posterior, the
contribution to prediction uncertainty of evidence, as well as the expected
reduction of prediction uncertainties concerning posterior and evidence, and
thus provide flexibility for highly effective design of integration points.
These acquisition functions are further extended to the transitional BQ scheme,
along with several specific refinements, to tackle the above-mentioned
challenges with high efficiency and robustness. Effectiveness of the
developments is ultimately demonstrated with extensive benchmark studies and
application to an engineering example.

Conclusion: 所提方法能利用随机动力学的内在结构特性，同时保持计算精度和实现简单性。

Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems provide essential mathematical frameworks for
modeling complex real-world phenomena. The Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK)
equation governs the evolution of probability density functions associated with
stochastic system trajectories. Developing robust numerical methods for solving
the FPK equation is critical for understanding and predicting stochastic
behavior. Here, we introduce the distribution self-adaptive normalized
physics-informed neural network (DSN-PINNs) for solving time-dependent FPK
equations through the integration of soft normalization constraints with
adaptive resampling strategies. Specifically, we employ a
normalization-enhanced PINN model in a pretraining phase to establish the
solution's global structure and scale, generating a reliable prior
distribution. Subsequently, guided by this prior, we dynamically reallocate
training points via weighted kernel density estimation, concentrating
computational resources on regions most representative of the underlying
probability distribution throughout the learning process. The key innovation
lies in our method's ability to exploit the intrinsic structural properties of
stochastic dynamics while maintaining computational accuracy and implementation
simplicity. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive
numerical experiments and comparative analyses with existing methods, including
validation on real-world economic datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出高效图像检索调度框架HiMIR，实现准确率提升和计算量降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法准确率有限，多向量检索仍存在准确率和效率问题，需改进。

Method: 引入分层范式增强对齐，利用跨层相似度一致性和层稀疏性减少冗余，为各数据集自动配置参数。

Result: HiMIR相比现有多向量检索系统大幅提高准确率，最多减少3.5倍计算量。

Conclusion: HiMIR是一种有效且高效的图像检索调度框架。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化（SOR）框架解决传统迁移学习局限，在少样本医学图像分类任务取得有竞争力结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习在适应特定领域特征和处理少量数据时存在局限，易导致过拟合。

Method: 提出SOR框架，冻结内部网络结构，结合组套索和L1惩罚。

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务中，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4作为基础模型取得有竞争力结果。

Conclusion: SOR框架简单有效，能以最少额外参数使模型适应特定数据，适用于多种网络组件和迁移学习任务。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Motivation: 为动态手势识别任务的单模态3D - CNN训练利用多模态知识，改进现有显式融合多模态信息方法的不足。

Method: 为各模态设置单独网络，使其协作学习，引入“时空语义对齐”损失（SSA），用“焦点正则化参数”正则化该损失。

Result: 框架提升了单模态网络测试时的识别准确率，在多个动态手势识别数据集上达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效，能利用多模态知识提升单模态3D - CNN在动态手势识别中的性能。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于转导深度学习的SRC方法有效，能取得更好的分类效果。

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Conclusion: LLM方法在现实目标检测任务中具有适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境中应用多模态变压器提供指导，并开源代码以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

Method: 将活动类安排成结构化层次，提出Hi - OSCAR分级开放集分类器，收集新数据集NFI_FARED。

Result: Hi - OSCAR能以先进的准确率识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动，还能将未知类定位到最近内部节点；收集了NFI_FARED数据集。

Conclusion: Hi - OSCAR有助于解决HAR中的开放集分类问题，NFI_FARED数据集可促进未来开放集HAR研究。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

TL;DR: 本文围绕DINOv2感知本质展开研究，用SAEs实现LRH建字典，分析下游任务概念招募、概念几何和统计特性，提出MRH。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DINOv2感知的本质。

Method: 采用线性表示假设（LRH），用自编码器（SAEs）构建32000单元字典，进行下游任务分析、概念的几何和统计分析。

Result: 发现下游任务有功能专业化；表示部分密集非严格稀疏；字典向更连贯发展；提出Minkowski表示假设（MRH）。

Conclusion: 提出MRH可用于解释视觉Transformer表示，表明表示组织不止线性稀疏。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

Conclusion: 所提生物启发的预处理方法能有效减轻对抗噪声、保留语义完整性，无需对下游分类器重新训练或微调，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Conclusion: SkipSR框架简单有效，能在标准和一步扩散超分辨率模型中保留感知质量，同时显著减少计算量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Conclusion: 提出的仅修改视觉编码器的策略能有效减轻大视觉语言模型的对象幻觉。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [242] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督OOD检测方法，在SemanticKITTI数据集上优于现有基于不确定性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助数据集或混淆认知和偶然不确定性，需更好的无监督OOD检测方法。

Method: 采用深度神经网络特征空间中高斯混合模型（GMM）参数的分层贝叶斯建模得到的认知不确定性。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比之前的预测熵方法，AUROC提高18%，AUPRC增加22%，FPR95降低36%。

Conclusion: 该无监督OOD检测方法无需辅助数据和额外训练阶段，性能优于现有基于不确定性的方法。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

TL;DR: 提出SOS数据合成管道，基于以对象为中心的组合策略，合成数据训练模型在检测和接地任务上表现优于真实图像数据集，还能实现可控数据集构建和提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型标注数据集成本高、覆盖有偏差且难扩展，合成数据缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 提出SOS数据合成管道，利用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: SOS合成的100000张图像训练的模型在检测和接地任务上表现优于GRIT和V3Det等真实图像数据集；增强LVIS和COCO数据集在不同规模真实数据下表现良好。

Conclusion: SOS实现了可控数据集构建，提升了低数据和封闭词汇设置下的泛化能力，还支持视觉接地中挑战性的类内引用的目标数据生成。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in
this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念家族内的层次结构和不同概念家族间的组合性，且双曲空间表示组合性的适用性不明。

Method: 提出PHyCLIP，在双曲因子的笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁ - 积度量。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上，PHyCLIP优于现有单空间方法，且嵌入空间结构更具可解释性。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP能有效解决现有视觉语言模型在表达语义结构上的问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

Conclusion: HMVDx为MLLMs在医疗领域视频理解的应用研究做出重要技术贡献，揭示了低成本MLLMs在医疗应用中的潜在价值。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

Conclusion: 该方法能生成特定领域数据，弥合有限数据与实际应用间的差距，助力数据稀缺场景下的实时动物健康监测。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集实验表明，PAChroma有效降低上色质量并保持视觉外观。

Conclusion: 该工作是保护视觉内容免受非法AI上色的第一步，为生成式媒体版权保护奠定基础。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS - NL任务中表现出了最先进的性能，具有强大的域泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Result: 配备字幕的模型性能大幅提升，如Qwen2.5 - VL - 72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude - Opus - 4从44.8%提升到73.0%。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和CapGeo - Bench数据集为提升MLLMs几何推理能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Result: 训练特征归因产生细粒度、特定于测试的解释，能识别导致错误分类的有害示例，揭示传统方法未暴露的虚假关联。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法为深度模型内部工作机制提供新见解。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Conclusion: 提出的SilvaScenes数据集有其相关性和挑战性，有助于森林管理机器人感知系统的开发，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Motivation: 当前文献倾向采用通用VLMs，缺乏对专用模型性能上限的系统评估，需建立基准进行公平比较。

Method: 建立零样本图像隐私分类基准，用任务对齐提示评估前3开源VLMs，并与已有视觉和多模态方法对比。

Result: VLMs参数多、推理慢，隐私预测精度落后于专用小模型，但对图像扰动鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: VLMs目前在图像隐私预测精度上不如专用小模型，但有较高鲁棒性。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型处理无限视频流时面临延迟和内存使用问题，全注意力处理计算成本高，滑动窗口方法有缺陷。

Method: 提出StreamingVLM统一框架，推理时维护紧凑KV缓存，通过简单监督微调策略训练，构建新基准Inf - Streams - Eval进行评估。

Result: 在Inf - Streams - Eval上对GPT - 4O mini胜率达66.18%，单NVIDIA H100上8 FPS保持实时稳定性能，提升通用VQA能力。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM能有效实现实时、稳定理解无限视觉输入，其微调策略可提升通用VQA能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 探索视觉和听觉刺激如何结合以引发伪触觉压力感，为传统触觉硬件提供低成本替代方案。

Method: 进行基于Unity的Rollball游戏实验，让参与者在三种纹理地形上操控虚拟球，用传感器实时捕捉手指力，不同地形搭配不同滚动音效。

Result: 平均触觉力随提示强度增加而系统增加，更高音频频率和更密集视觉纹理引发更强肌肉激活，两者结合降低感知表面变化所需的力。

Conclusion: 消费级等距设备可可靠诱导和测量分级伪触觉反馈，可用于开发经济实惠的康复工具、训练模拟器和辅助界面。

Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the
brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a
low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a
comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory
stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity
tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a
virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were
captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain
was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440
Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional
"knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased
systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only
trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3,
respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited
stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force
needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These
results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce
and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators,
opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and
assistive interfaces.

Result: MLLMs在某些维度上能近似人类偏好，但在其他维度上存在差异。

Conclusion: MLLMs在补充早期UX研究方面既有潜力也有局限性。

Abstract: In an ideal design pipeline, user interface (UI) design is intertwined with
user research to validate decisions, yet studies are often resource-constrained
during early exploration. Recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) offer a promising opportunity to act as early evaluators, helping
designers narrow options before formal testing. Unlike prior work that
emphasizes user behavior in narrow domains such as e-commerce with metrics like
clicks or conversions, we focus on subjective user evaluations across varied
interfaces. We investigate whether MLLMs can mimic human preferences when
evaluating individual UIs and comparing them. Using data from a crowdsourcing
platform, we benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces and
examine alignment with human judgments on multiple UI factors. Our results show
that MLLMs approximate human preferences on some dimensions but diverge on
others, underscoring both their potential and limitations in supplementing
early UX research.

directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an
eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we
find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show
how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design
directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more

Conclusion: RDWT是一种低开销、架构感知的预处理技术，可提升深度模型的准确率和一致性。

Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of the Rational Discrete Wavelet
Transform (RDWT), used as a plug-in preprocessing step for motor imagery
electroencephalographic (EEG) decoding prior to applying deep learning
classifiers. A systematic paired evaluation (with/without RDWT) is conducted on
four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet,
MBEEG\_SENet, and EEGTCNet. This evaluation was carried out across three
benchmark datasets: High Gamma, BCI-IV-2a, and BCI-IV-2b. The performance of
the RDWT is reported with subject-wise averages using accuracy and Cohen's
kappa, complemented by subject-level analyses to identify when RDWT is
beneficial. On BCI-IV-2a, RDWT yields clear average gains for EEGTCNet (+4.44
percentage points, pp; kappa +0.059) and MBEEG\_SENet (+2.23 pp; +0.030), with
smaller improvements for EEGNet (+2.08 pp; +0.027) and ShallowConvNet (+0.58
pp; +0.008). On BCI-IV-2b, the enhancements observed are modest yet consistent
for EEGNet (+0.21 pp; +0.044) and EEGTCNet (+0.28 pp; +0.077). On HGD, average
effects are modest to positive, with the most significant gain observed for
MBEEG\_SENet (+1.65 pp; +0.022), followed by EEGNet (+0.76 pp; +0.010) and
EEGTCNet (+0.54 pp; +0.008). Inspection of the subject material reveals
significant enhancements in challenging recordings (e.g., non-stationary
sessions), indicating that RDWT can mitigate localized noise and enhance
rhythm-specific information. In conclusion, RDWT is shown to be a low-overhead,
architecture-aware preprocessing technique that can yield tangible gains in
accuracy and agreement for deep model families and challenging subjects.

Motivation: 研究长期线下关系社交网络中错误信息为何持续扩散，即便多数人认为其为假。

Method: 构建心理博弈论模型，让接收信息的个体先决定反应方式，再决定是否转发。

Result: 当个体对同伴压力敏感且网络有结构极化时，错误信息即便多数人不信也能广泛传播。

Conclusion: 仅提升信息素养无法遏制错误信息传播。

Abstract: We examine how misinformation spreads in social networks composed of
individuals with long-term offline relationships. Especially, we focus on why
misinformation persists and diffuses despite being recognized by most as false.
In our psychological game theoretical model, each agent who receives a piece of
(mis)information must first decide how to react -- by openly endorsing it,
remaining silent, or openly challenging it. After observing the reactions of
her neighbors who also received the message, the agent then chooses whether to
forward it to others in her own chatroom who have not yet received it. By
distinguishing these two roles, our framework addresses puzzling real-world
phenomena, such as the gap between what individuals privately believe and what
they publicly transmit. A key assumption in our model is that, while perceived
veracity influences decisions, the dominant factor is the alignment between an
agent's beliefs and those of her social network -- a feature characteristic of
communities formed through long-term offline relationships. This dynamic can
lead agents to tacitly accept and even propagate information they privately
judge to be of low credibility. Our results challenge the view that improving
information literacy alone can curb the spread of misinformation. We show that
when agents are highly sensitive to peer pressure and the network exhibits
structural polarization, even if the majority does not genuinely believe in it,
the message still can spread widely without encountering open resistance.

Abstract: Catastrophic floods directly risk 1.8 billion lives worldwide, most of whom
are from East and South Asia. How do extreme floods reshape paid labor
outcomes? To answer this, I focus on a 1-in-100 year flood event in India. I
first combine Sentinel-1 SAR with JRC Global Surface Water dataset to generate
flood map. Using information from this map in various rounds of periodic labor
force surveys, I estimate gender-specific dynamic effects of the flood shock.
Key results show that men experienced short-lived reduction in their employment
while women faced a delayed but persistent decline in their working hours. Men
suffered most in secondary sector and increased their participation in primary
sector. Women were hit hardest in the tertiary sector. Such sectoral impacts
could be attributable to disruptions in infrastructure and physical capital.
Moreover, marital status and dependency burden further shape the gender
differential effects of the extreme flood event. Results remain robust under
alternative treatment definitions.

Abstract: Connected health is a multidisciplinary approach focused on health
management, prioritizing pa-tient needs in the creation of tools, services, and

the timely exchange of accurate patient information among all stake-holders in
the care continuum. The rise of digital technologies and process innovations
promises to enhance connected health by integrating various healthcare data
sources. This integration aims to personalize care, predict health outcomes,
and streamline patient management, though challeng-es remain, particularly in
data architecture, application interoperability, and security. Data analytics
can provide critical insights for informed decision-making and health
co-creation, but solutions must prioritize end-users, including patients and
healthcare professionals. This perspective was explored through an agile System
Development Lifecycle in an EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated
AI-generated solution for managing cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy.
This paper contributes with a collaborative digital framework integrating
stakeholders across the care continuum, leveraging federated big data analytics
and artificial intelligence for improved decision-making while ensuring

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术发展，需保护人类自主性和促进道德决策，以增强信任和问责制，积极维护和强化人类能动性。

Method: 研究维护基本权利、强化人类能动性和嵌入有效人类监督机制的AI系统设计策略，讨论关键监督模型，提出基于风险的框架。

Result: 将AI模型风险级别与适当的人类监督形式相联系。

Conclusion: 强调人类参与在AI负责任部署中的关键作用，平衡技术创新与个人价值和权利保护，确保AI技术负责任使用，保障个人自主性并最大化社会效益。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to advance, protecting
human autonomy and promoting ethical decision-making are essential to fostering
trust and accountability. Human agency (the capacity of individuals to make
informed decisions) should be actively preserved and reinforced by AI systems.
This paper examines strategies for designing AI systems that uphold fundamental
rights, strengthen human agency, and embed effective human oversight
mechanisms. It discusses key oversight models, including Human-in-Command
(HIC), Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), and Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL), and proposes a
risk-based framework to guide the implementation of these mechanisms. By
linking the level of AI model risk to the appropriate form of human oversight,
the paper underscores the critical role of human involvement in the responsible
deployment of AI, balancing technological innovation with the protection of
individual values and rights. In doing so, it aims to ensure that AI
technologies are used responsibly, safeguarding individual autonomy while
maximizing societal benefits.

TL;DR: 提出语义路由器对查询分类，按需应用推理，在MMLU - Pro基准上提升准确率，降低延迟和令牌消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理虽提升准确率，但会带来推理延迟、令牌使用成本及环境和财务影响，简单提示下这些成本不必要。

Method: 提出语义路由器，根据查询的推理需求对其分类，仅在有益时应用推理。

Result: 在MMLU - Pro基准上准确率提升10.2个百分点，响应延迟降低47.1%，令牌消耗降低48.5%。

Conclusion: 语义路由能有效平衡开源大语言模型服务系统的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when
augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time
scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency
and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are
unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that
classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively
applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage
point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response
latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference
with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective
mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source
LLM serving systems

<details>

Motivation: 传统跨专业教育方法受成本、可扩展性和无法模拟真实临床场景复杂性的限制，需新解决方案。

Method: 设计开发集成大语言模型、虚拟环境引擎和角色创建管道的AIMS系统，进行正式可用性测试，参与者模拟医疗团队角色对话。

Result: 发现可用性问题用于改进，总体表明AIMS支持现实、特定专业及情境合适的对话。

Conclusion: 探讨了AIMS的技术和教学创新，给出未来研究方向。

Abstract: Interprofessional education has long relied on case studies and the use of
standardized patients to support teamwork, communication, and related
collaborative competencies among healthcare professionals. However, traditional
approaches are often limited by cost, scalability, and inability to mimic the
dynamic complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. To address these
challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive
Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large
language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine,
and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal
interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to
enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies
among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal
usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional
roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted
conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context,
and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response
latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements. Findings in general suggest
that AIMS supports realistic, profession-specific and contextually appropriate
conversations. We discussed both technical and pedagogical innovations of AIMS
and concluded with future directions.

Result: 在糖尿病和抑郁症干预的真实网络荟萃分析数据集上展示了方法的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于网络荟萃分析，还适用于涉及三种或更多治疗选择的决策问题。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing research interest in addressing
treatment hierarchy questions within network meta-analysis (NMA). In NMAs
involving many treatments, the number of possible hierarchy questions becomes
prohibitively large. To manage this complexity, previous work has recommended
pre-selecting specific hierarchy questions of interest (e.g., ``among options
A, B, C, D, E, do treatments A and B have the two best effects in terms of
improving outcome X?") and calculating the empirical probabilities of the
answers being true given the data. In contrast, we propose an efficient and
scalable algorithmic approach that eliminates the need for pre-specification by
systematically generating a comprehensive catalog of highly credible treatment
hierarchy questions, specifically, those with empirical probabilities exceeding
a chosen threshold (e.g., 95%). This enables decision-makers to extract all
meaningful insights supported by the data. An additional algorithm trims
redundant insights from the output to facilitate interpretation. We define and
address six broad types of binary hierarchy questions (i.e., those with
true/false answers), covering standard hierarchy questions answered using
existing ranking metrics - pairwise comparisons and (cumulative) ranking
probabilities - as well as many other complex hierarchy questions. We have
implemented our methods in an R package and illustrate their application using
real NMA datasets on diabetes and depression interventions. Beyond NMA, our
approach is relevant to any decision problem concerning three or more treatment
options.

Abstract: Parameter estimation and inference from complex survey samples typically
focuses on global model parameters whose estimators have asymptotic properties,
such as from fixed effects regression models. We present a motivating example
of Bayesian inference for a multi-level or mixed effects model in which both
the local parameters (e.g. group level random effects) and the global
parameters may need to be adjusted for the complex sampling design. We evaluate
the limitations of the survey-weighted pseudo-posterior and an existing
automated post-processing method to incorporate the complex survey sample
design for a wide variety of Bayesian models. We propose modifications to the
automated process and demonstrate their improvements for multi-level models via
a simulation study and a motivating example from the National Survey on Drug
Use and Health. Reproduction examples are available from the authors and the
updated R package is available via

Motivation: 工程风险中计算失效概率对系统参数变化的灵敏度困难，现有方法有局限性，需通用方法。

Method: 提出用响应值和关于灵敏度参数的梯度计算灵敏度的理论和蒙特卡罗策略，借助核平滑概念解决零概率事件问题。

Result: 所提方法可在一次蒙特卡罗运行中为所有响应阈值生成灵敏度估计，通过多个不同性质灵敏度参数的例子进行研究。

Conclusion: 随着响应梯度越来越容易获取，该工作有望为在同一蒙特卡罗运行中嵌入灵敏度和可靠性计算提供基础。

Abstract: Engineering risk is concerned with the likelihood of failure and the
scenarios when it occurs. The sensitivity of failure probability to change in
system parameters is relevant to risk-informed decision making. Computing
sensitivity is at least one level more difficult than the probability itself,
which is already challenged by a large number of input random variables, rare
events and implicit nonlinear `black-box' response. Finite difference with
Monte Carlo probability estimates is spurious, requiring the number of samples
to grow with the reciprocal of step size to suppress estimation variance. Many
existing works gain efficiency by exploiting a specific class of input
variables, sensitivity parameters, or response in its exact or surrogate form.
For general systems, this work presents a theory and associated Monte Carlo
strategy for computing sensitivity using response values and gradients with
respect to sensitivity parameters. It is shown that the sensitivity at a given
response threshold can be expressed via the expectation of response gradient
conditional on the threshold. Determining the expectation requires conditioning
on the threshold that is a zero-probability event, but it can be resolved by
the concept of kernel smoothing. The proposed method offers sensitivity
estimates for all response thresholds generated in a single Monte Carlo run. It
is investigated in a number of examples featuring sensitivity parameters of
different nature. As response gradient becomes increasingly available, it is
hoped that this work can provide the basis for embedding sensitivity
calculations with reliability in the same Monte Carlo run.

Motivation: 社会科学问题需研究语言属性对受众态度和行为的因果影响，现有深度学习方法存在重叠偏差问题，需解决潜在混淆因素。

Method: 引入新的实验设计处理潜在混淆因素，避免重叠问题，无偏估计处理效应，并应用于评估政治沟通中表达谦逊说服力的实验。

Result: 基于大语言模型的方法在实验中的表现比简单词袋模型差。

Conclusion: 分离出表达谦逊对政治声明说服力的因果效应，为社交媒体平台、政策制定者和社会科学家提供了关于传播效果的新见解。

Abstract: Many social science questions ask how linguistic properties causally affect
an audience's attitudes and behaviors. Because text properties are often
interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for
possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature
proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations
of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However,
because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods
risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself,
inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we
introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the
overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design
in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in
political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based
methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text
and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect
of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements,
offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms,
policy makers, and social scientists.

Motivation: 探索集成跨部门规划相比现有国家计划如何降低成本，以助力德国2045年实现净零温室气体排放目标。

Method: 开发新的线性优化模型PyPSA - DE，以高时空分辨率模拟德国及其邻国能源系统各部门的电力和氢气传输网络、供需和存储情况。

Result: 新模型显示电网有较强发展，但总扩张比国家电网发展计划低三分之一，降低成本920 - 1910亿欧元（2020年价值），平均电网关税降低7.5欧元（2020年价值）/兆瓦时。

Conclusion: 成本节约主要源于集成规划和运营、区域价格的市场设计以及海上风电的系统最优利用，且PyPSA - DE开源可用于研究能源转型相关问题。

Abstract: Germany has set an ambitious target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas
emissions by 2045. We explore how integrated cross-sectoral planning can reduce
costs compared to existing national plans. Our new linear optimization model
PyPSA-DE simulates the electricity and hydrogen transmission networks, as well
as supply, demand, and storage in all sectors of the energy system in Germany
and its neighboring countries with high spatial and temporal resolution. While
our new model shows strong electricity transmission grid development, total
expansion is one third lower than in the national grid development plan,
lowering costs by 92 billion EUR$_{2020}$ to 191 billion EUR$_{2020}$ and
average grid tariffs by 7.5 EUR$_{2020}$ / MWh. These savings are mainly due to
integrated planning and operation, a market design with regional prices, and a
system-optimal usage of offshore wind. PyPSA-DE is open-source and can readily
be adapted to study related issues around the energy transition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证明P≠NP。

Method: 提出组合、信息论框架，结合对称性和稀疏性，证明Switching - by - Weakness范式，利用符号不变中立引理和模板稀疏化定理。

Result: 得到成功界2^(-Ω(t))，复杂度K_poly((X_1,…,X_t) | (Φ_1,…,Φ_t)) ≥ ηt，与P = NP下的复杂度O(1)矛盾。

Conclusion: P≠NP，证明非相对化且非自然。

Abstract: We give a compositional, information-theoretic framework that turns short
programs into locality on many independent blocks, and combine it with symmetry
and sparsity of masked random Unique-SAT to obtain distributional lower bounds
that contradict the self-reduction upper bound under $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$.
We work in the weakness quantale $w_Q=K_{\mathrm{poly}}(\cdot\mid\cdot)$. For
an efficiently samplable ensemble $D_m$ made by masking random $3$-CNFs with
fresh $S_m\ltimes(\mathbb{Z}_2)^m$ symmetries and a small-seed
Valiant--Vazirani isolation layer, we prove a Switching-by-Weakness normal
form: for any polytime decoder $P$ of description length $\le \delta t$ (with
$t=\Theta(m)$ blocks), a short wrapper $W$ makes $(P\circ W)$ per-bit local on
a $\gamma$-fraction of blocks. Two ingredients then force near-randomness on
$\Omega(t)$ blocks for every short decoder: (a) a sign-invariant neutrality
lemma giving $\Pr[X_i=1\mid \mathcal{I}]=1/2$ for any sign-invariant view
$\mathcal{I}$; and (b) a template sparsification theorem at logarithmic radius
showing that any fixed local rule appears with probability $m^{-\Omega(1)}$.
Combined with single-block bounds for tiny $\mathrm{ACC}^0$/streaming decoders,
this yields a success bound $2^{-\Omega(t)}$ and, by Compression-from-Success,
$K_{\mathrm{poly}}\big((X_1,\ldots,X_t)\mid(\Phi_1,\ldots,\Phi_t)\big)\ge \eta
t$. If $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, a uniform constant-length program maps any
on-promise instance to its unique witness in polytime (bit fixing via a
$\mathrm{USAT}$ decider), so $K_{\mathrm{poly}}(X\mid\Phi)\le O(1)$ and the
tuple complexity is $O(1)$, contradicting the linear bound. The proof is
non-relativizing and non-natural; symmetry, sparsification, and switching yield
a quantale upper-lower clash, hence $\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}$.

the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on
both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially
coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and
healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5,

Conclusion: 所提方法在处理具有参数不确定性的非线性系统方面有效且优越

Abstract: In this work, we propose a meta-learning-based Koopman modeling and
predictive control approach for nonlinear systems with parametric
uncertainties. An adaptive deep meta-learning-based modeling approach, called
Meta Adaptive Koopman Operator (MAKO), is proposed. Without knowledge of the
parametric uncertainty, the proposed MAKO approach can learn a meta-model from
a multi-modal dataset and efficiently adapt to new systems with previously
unseen parameter settings by using online data. Based on the learned meta
Koopman model, a predictive control scheme is developed, and the stability of
the closed-loop system is ensured even in the presence of previously unseen
parameter settings. Through extensive simulations, our proposed approach
demonstrates superior performance in both modeling accuracy and control
efficacy as compared to competitive baselines.

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing Steiner Minimal Trees (SMTs) in
hyperbolic space. Exact SMT computation is NP-hard, and existing hyperbolic
heuristics such as HyperSteiner are deterministic and often get trapped in
locally suboptimal configurations. We introduce Randomized HyperSteiner (RHS),
a stochastic Delaunay triangulation heuristic that incorporates randomness into
the expansion process and refines candidate trees via Riemannian gradient
descent optimization. Experiments on synthetic data sets and a real-world
single-cell transcriptomic data show that RHS outperforms Minimum Spanning Tree
(MST), Neighbour Joining, and vanilla HyperSteiner (HS). In near-boundary
configurations, RHS can achieve a 32% reduction in total length over HS,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in diverse data regimes.

Motivation: 以往发音特征在自动语音识别中的应用局限于浅层声学模型，作者希望在深度学习时代重新探索其作用。

Method: 提出一个框架，将发音表示作为辅助任务和识别模型的伪输入，采用语音反转作为辅助预测任务，并将预测的发音特征通过交叉注意力模块注入模型。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上的实验表明，该方法比基于Transformer的强基线模型有持续改进，尤其在低资源条件下。

Conclusion: 曾经在自动语音识别研究中被忽视的发音特征，在结合现代架构重新引入时能带来有意义的好处。

Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as
complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their
use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit
articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework
that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a
pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion
as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are
injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with
acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate
that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based
baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest
that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide
meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

Motivation: 以往研究多将压力视为静态标签，本文旨在将压力建模为受历史情绪状态影响的随时间演变的现象。

Method: 提出从情绪标签导出细粒度压力注释的动态标注策略，引入基于交叉注意力的顺序模型（单向LSTM和Transformer编码器）捕捉压力的时间变化。

Result: 在MuSE和StressID数据集上比现有基线分别提高了5%和18%的准确率，且能很好地泛化到自定义的真实世界数据集。

Conclusion: 将压力建模为动态结构在语音压力检测中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure
settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress
detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress
as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state.
We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress
annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based
sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture
temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on
MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to
a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling
stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

Method: 采用低秩分解和特征蒸馏压缩嵌入，合并层而非移除层进行剪枝。

Result: 最终模型在MacBook Air M1上体积减小48%，速度提升2.15倍，保留90%原性能。

Conclusion: 提出的剪枝方案能在数据稀缺场景有效压缩Whisper模型，提升其在边缘设备的性能。

Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is
challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover
performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains
on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can
Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings?
Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new
pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to
frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with
low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers,
we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the
original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air
M1.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross
modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage
overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework
for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by
textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based
on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape
features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with
parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a
corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original
surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of
parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer
Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369,
with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is
particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.

Conclusion: 课程旨在为学生、研究人员和从业者提供工具，推动生成式基于物理渲染研究。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in
vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process,
new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional
distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly
effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions.
This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring
accurate sample generation.
  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The
update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update
depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter
space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based
optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important
role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise
quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.
  A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples
(images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven
manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still
missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of
these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge,
linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide
necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and
practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

TL;DR: 提出deep - REMAP深度学习框架预测恒星大气参数，应用于FGK巨星候选体，验证效果好且框架可扩展


<details>

Motivation: 传统光谱分析方法在调查数据量爆炸时代达到极限

Method: 开发deep - REMAP框架，在PHOENIX合成光谱库训练卷积神经网络，用迁移学习在MARVELS调查的FGK矮星光谱子集上微调模型

Result: 在30颗MARVELS校准星上验证，准确恢复有效温度、表面重力和金属丰度，如有效温度精度约75K

Conclusion: deep - REMAP框架可解释、对参数不平衡有鲁棒性、能捕捉非高斯不确定性，可扩展到其他调查和合成库，是恒星特征描述的有力自动化途径

Abstract: In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic
analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP,
a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task
approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We
train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral
library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of
observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to
732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated
on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective
temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity
([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in
$T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding
loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to
parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties.
While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other
surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway
for stellar characterization.

Conclusion: 强调了网络数据的预测能力，以及供应链网络使中小企业面临相关违约风险的作用。

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are known to play a vital role in
economic growth, employment, and innovation. However, they tend to face
significant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories,
collateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges
make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since
SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which
default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for
modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans
provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach
employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network
data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We
show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only
improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion
risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and
intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a
deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the
predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks
in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.

TL;DR: 本文提出联合设计组合器和预编码器的方法，通过最大化接收导频与密集MIMO信道间的互信息来提升信道估计性能，提出2DIF和TS - 2DIF算法，仿真显示其信道估计精度优于现有方案。

Motivation: 密集MIMO天线间强相关性提供信道状态信息先验知识，启发设计观测矩阵以提升信道估计性能。

Method: 提出2DIF算法，通过最大化互信息联合设计组合器和预编码器；将其扩展到混合组合系统，开发TS - 2DIF算法处理模拟组合电路。

Result: 仿真结果表明，2DIF和TS - 2DIF方法相比现有方案能实现更优的信道估计精度。

Conclusion: 所提2DIF和TS - 2DIF方法在密集MIMO信道估计中具有优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, densifying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has
attracted much attention from the communication community. Thanks to the
subwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying
antennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information
(CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit
precoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to
boost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work
proposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual
information between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A
two-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently
accomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the
eigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two
sub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter
antennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder
and the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF
promises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further
extend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a
two-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining
circuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that,
compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods
can achieve superior channel estimation accuracy.

Motivation: 解决先前基于GMM和GNN设计预编码器时，GMM组件数量随反馈比特指数增长的问题。

Method: 利用向量量化变分自编码器（VQ - VAE），联合训练GNN和VQ - VAE并进行导频优化，形成端到端模型。

Result: 仿真表明该框架在多用户无线系统和速率上有显著性能提升，优于涉及子离散傅里叶变换（DFT）导频矩阵和迭代预编码器算法的传统方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架可实现更少导频或反馈比特的系统部署。

Abstract: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD)
systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment
through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully
designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a
vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key
drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to
the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE
allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot
optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable
performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional
methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and
iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized
by fewer pilots or feedback bits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有源定位或MEG - fMRI融合方法难以在单试次自然主义数据中同时保留高空间和时间分辨率，需要新方法解决此问题。

Method: 收集受试者听故事时的全头MEG数据，结合开放fMRI数据集，开发基于Transformer的编码模型，同时预测多个受试者的MEG和fMRI数据，通过隐层估计皮质源响应。

Result: 模型预测MEG优于单模态编码模型，模拟实验中源估计时空保真度高于经典最小范数解，估计源在跨受试者和模态上有强泛化性，对新数据集ECoG的预测优于ECoG训练的编码模型。

Conclusion: 整合自然主义实验、MEG、fMRI和编码模型的力量，为实现高精度脑图谱绘制提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial
resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can
capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both
high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source
localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial
naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively
to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an
open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based
encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic
speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses
with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and
fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents
our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better
than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields
source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic
minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated
latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects
and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict
electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an
entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic
experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route
towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.

Result: 实验揭示了所提方法在分层网络视觉任务中的重要性，验证了“视觉系统脑区的层次信息内容可通过解码结果量化以反映信息层次”的假设，发现海马体收集的神经数据有随机解码表现。

Conclusion: 所提方法在视觉任务的分层网络中有重要意义，海马体神经数据随机解码表现虽有负面影响但仍具科学价值。

Abstract: Understanding the encoding and decoding mechanisms of dynamic neural
responses to different visual stimuli is an important topic in exploring how
the brain represents visual information. Currently, hierarchically deep neural
networks (DNNs) have played a significant role as tools for mining the core
features of complex data. However, most methods often overlook the dynamic
generation process of neural data, such as hierarchical brain's visual data,
within the brain's structure. In the decoding of brain's visual data, two main
paradigms are 'fine-grained decoding tests' and 'rough-grained decoding tests',
which we define as focusing on a single brain region and studying the overall
structure across multiple brain regions, respectively. In this paper, we mainly
use the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset from the Allen Brain Institute, and
the hierarchical information extracted from some single brain regions (i.e.,
fine-grained decoding tests) is provided to the proposed method for studying
the adaptive topological decoding between brain regions, called the Adaptive
Topological Vision Transformer, or AT-ViT. In numerous experiments, the results
reveal the importance of the proposed method in hierarchical networks in the
visual tasks, and also validate the hypothesis that "the hierarchical
information content in brain regions of the visual system can be quantified by
decoding outcomes to reflect an information hierarchy." Among them, we found
that neural data collected in the hippocampus can have a random decoding
performance, and this negative impact on performance still holds significant
scientific value.

Method: 在QNUM数学框架下开发控制算法，提出QPrimal - Dual算法，通过放置网络控制器解决问题，给出稳定性证明及减少控制开销方案。

Result: QPrimalDual在性能上显著优于基线分配策略，可随网络规模扩展，对延迟和退相干有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: QPrimalDual可作为量子网络全分布式资源分配的实用、高性能基础。

Abstract: We introduce a distributed resource allocation framework for the Quantum
Internet that relies on feedback-based, fully decentralized coordination to
serve multiple co-existing applications. We develop quantum network control
algorithms under the mathematical framework of Quantum Network Utility
Maximization (QNUM), where utility functions quantify network performance by
mapping entanglement rate and quality into a joint optimization objective. We
then introduce QPrimal-Dual, a decentralized, scalable algorithm that solves
QNUM by strategically placing network controllers that operate using local
state information and limited classical message exchange. We prove global
asymptotic stability for concave, separable utility functions, and provide
sufficient conditions for local stability for broader non-concave cases. To
reduce control overhead and account for quantum memory decoherence, we also
propose schemes that locally approximate global quantities and prevent
congestion in the network. We evaluate the performance of our approach via
simulations in realistic quantum network architectures. Results show that
QPrimalDual significantly outperforms baseline allocation strategies, scales
with network size, and is robust to latency and decoherence. Our observations
suggest that QPrimalDual could be a practical, high-performance foundation for
fully distributed resource allocation in quantum networks.

Motivation: 此前不可知断层扫描工作仅能处理纯态假设，本文旨在解决积混合态假设的不可知断层扫描问题。

Method: 先将积混合态的不可知断层扫描问题归约为经典的鲁棒学习二元积分布任务，再给出该经典任务的近最优高效算法，利用新的最优接近度证书和凸松弛。

Result: 给出的算法能找到与目标态 $O(\epsilon \log 1 / \epsilon)$ 接近的积态，使用多项式数量的副本且运行时间为多项式，仅使用单量子比特单拷贝测量。

Conclusion: 该算法是首个对混合态假设类实现非平凡不可知断层扫描保证的高效算法，且证明了在仅使用单量子比特双结果投影测量时，自适应在信息论上是必要的。

Abstract: We consider the problem of agnostic tomography with \emph{mixed state}
ansatz, and specifically, the natural ansatz class of product mixed states. In
more detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which is
$\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\pi$, the goal is to output a
nearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\rho$. While there has
been a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only
handle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we
give an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a
product state which is $O(\epsilon \log 1 / \epsilon)$ close to $\rho$ which
uses polynomially many copies of $\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time.
Moreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To
our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any
non-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz.
  Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of
independent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient
reduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical
task of \emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook
problem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient
algorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product,
answering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing
a new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that
can be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation.
Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that
adaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography
task, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective
measurements.

Result: QuIRK能匹配或超越传统KAN，在周期函数中表现明显，且可利用GPU经典模拟。

Conclusion: QuIRK保留可解释性优势和产生闭式解的能力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks or KANs have shown the ability to outperform
classical Deep Neural Networks, while using far fewer trainable parameters for
regression problems on scientific domains. Even more powerful has been their
interpretability due to their structure being composed of univariate B-Spline
functions. This enables us to derive closed-form equations from trained KANs
for a wide range of problems. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired variant
of the KAN based on Quantum Data Re-uploading~(DR) models. The Quantum-Inspired
Re-uploading KAN or QuIRK model replaces B-Splines with single-qubit DR models
as the univariate function approximator, allowing them to match or outperform
traditional KANs while using even fewer parameters. This is especially apparent
in the case of periodic functions. Additionally, since the model utilizes only
single-qubit circuits, it remains classically tractable to simulate with
straightforward GPU acceleration. Finally, we also demonstrate that QuIRK
retains the interpretability advantages and the ability to produce closed-form
solutions.

Result: 该技术不仅提升性能、加速收敛，还能在同一计算机上同时运行多个VQAs。

Conclusion: Nest技术可同时平衡和优化三个相互冲突的指标。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to demonstrate
quantum utility on near-term quantum computers. However, these algorithms often
get executed on the highest-fidelity qubits and computers to achieve the best
performance, causing low system throughput. Recent efforts have shown that VQAs
can be run on low-fidelity qubits initially and high-fidelity qubits later on
to still achieve good performance. We take this effort forward and show that
carefully varying the qubit fidelity map of the VQA over its execution using
our technique, Nest, does not just (1) improve performance (i.e., help achieve
close to optimal results), but also (2) lead to faster convergence. We also use
Nest to co-locate multiple VQAs concurrently on the same computer, thus (3)
increasing the system throughput, and therefore, balancing and optimizing three
conflicting metrics simultaneously.

Abstract: Positive selection drives the emergence of adaptive mutations in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, shaping drug resistance, transmissibility, and
virulence. Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates
and provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present
a phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method
for converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable
for neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major
lineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165
neutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes
represented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between
isolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise
local evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence,
and the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection,
global attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model
achieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146
WHO-classified "uncertain" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent
emergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This
work demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into
GNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective
tools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant
prioritisation.

Result: PyNoetic涵盖BCI设计全流程，有丰富分析工具，可用于离线和实时BCI开发。

Conclusion: PyNoetic框架具有多功能和灵活性，能简化设计过程，加速BCI研究。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have
emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics,
virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks
face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential
for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without
programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software,
and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external
tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present
PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI
research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses
the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition
to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and
finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive
and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart
for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal
programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless
integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,
ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array
of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity
indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation
methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for

### [299] [Concept-Based Generic Programming in C++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08969)
*Bjarne Stroustrup*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 介绍用概念展示C++泛型编程的技术，给出简单类型系统示例，最后说明概念设计关键部分的设计原理和起源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示C++概念在泛型编程中的实用性和背后的基本思想。

Method: 通过提供简单类型系统示例，利用概念对类型系统进行用户自定义扩展。

Result: 展示了概念在C++泛型编程中的应用，体现了泛型编程是C++的重要组成部分。

Conclusion: 给出概念设计关键部分的设计原理和起源。

Abstract: We present programming techniques to illustrate the facilities and principles
of C++ generic programming using concepts. Concepts are C++'s way to express
constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type
system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking
without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used
throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to
show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to
provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for
generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library.
Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated
sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well
as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic
templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and
origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the
relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept
type-matching, and definition checking.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了用于高级算子融合的张量编译器Neptune，它能处理复杂归约计算，在注意力基准测试中表现优于现有编译器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量编译器难以融合涉及循环依赖的复杂归约计算，如注意力机制。

Method: Neptune采用新方法，故意打破一些现有依赖，并通过构建代数校正表达式来补偿，以保证内核产生正确结果。

Result: 在十个基于注意力的基准测试中，Neptune优于Triton、TVM等现有编译器，在四种不同GPU架构上，生成的内核平均加速比为1.35倍。

Conclusion: Neptune对深度学习工作负载有效。

Abstract: Operator fusion has become a key optimization for deep learning, which
combines multiple deep learning operators to improve data reuse and reduce
global memory transfers. However, existing tensor compilers struggle to fuse
complex reduction computations involving loop-carried dependencies, such as
attention mechanisms.
  The paper introduces Neptune, a tensor compiler for advanced operator fusion
for sequences of reduction operators. Neptune presents a new approach for
advanced operator fusion, which intentionally breaks some existing dependencies
and compensates by constructing algebraic correction expressions that allow the
kernel to produce the correct result.
  On ten attention-based benchmarks, Neptune, starting from simple attention
code and a high-level scheduling template, outperforms existing compilers like
Triton, TVM, and FlexAttention, including Triton-based implementations of
FlashAttention. Across four different GPU architectures from NVIDIA and AMD,
Neptune-generated kernels have average speedup of $1.35\times$ over the next
best alternative, demonstrating its effectiveness for deep learning workloads.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于Transformer的音乐错误检测方法LadderSym，在数据集上表现优于现有方法，还为相关序列评估任务提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐错误检测方法存在后期融合限制和依赖乐谱音频引入歧义等问题，影响性能。

Method: 提出LadderSym方法，包括带流间对齐模块的双流编码器和利用音频与符号乐谱的多模态策略。

Result: 在MAESTRO - E和CocoChorales - E数据集上，相比现有方法，LadderSym在漏音检测F1值翻倍，多余音符检测提升14.4分。

Conclusion: 该工作为强化学习、人类技能评估和模型评估等序列评估任务提供通用见解。

Abstract: Music learners can greatly benefit from tools that accurately detect errors
in their practice. Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to
music scores using heuristics or learnable models. This paper introduces
\textit{LadderSym}, a novel Transformer-based method for music error detection.
\textit{LadderSym} is guided by two key observations about the state-of-the-art
approaches: (1) late fusion limits inter-stream alignment and cross-modality
comparison capability; and (2) reliance on score audio introduces ambiguity in
the frequency spectrum, degrading performance in music with concurrent notes.
To address these limitations, \textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream
encoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison
capabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that
leverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic
representations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores.
We evaluate our method on the \textit{MAESTRO-E} and \textit{CocoChorales-E}
datasets by measuring the F1 score for each note category. Compared to the
previous state of the art, \textit{LadderSym} more than doubles F1 for missed
notes on \textit{MAESTRO-E} (26.8\% $\rightarrow$ 56.3\%) and improves extra
note detection by 14.4 points (72.0\% $\rightarrow$ 86.4\%). Similar gains are
observed on \textit{CocoChorales-E}. This work introduces general insights
about comparison models that could inform sequence evaluation tasks for
reinforcement Learning, human skill assessment, and model evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文研究语音输入对多模态大语言模型幻觉的影响，通过新基准评估模型，发现语音查询会增加幻觉，现有策略缓解效果不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注图像 - 文本设置下视觉语言模型的幻觉，而语音查询对多模态幻觉的影响未被充分探索，鉴于语音驱动界面的作用日益增长，因此开展此项研究。

Method: 提出音频增强的基准RePOPE - Spk，在不同声学条件下以语音形式提供查询，用其系统评估专有和开源模型。

Result: 语音查询比书面查询时幻觉增加，干净语音下错误率增加3%，有环境噪声时最多增加20%；输入顺序和查询长度影响鲁棒性，多样本提示和思维链推理等策略缓解效果有限。

Conclusion: 指出这是一个关键且未被充分探索的挑战，为构建可靠语音接口系统指明新方向。

Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models have been extensively studied using
benchmarks that probe reliability in image-text settings. In contrast, the
effect of spoken queries on multimodal hallucinations remains largely
unexplored, despite the growing role of voice-driven interfaces. In this work,
we investigate how spoken input influences hallucinations in multimodal large
language models. We present RePOPE-Spk, an audio-augmented extension of the
RePOPE benchmark, where queries are provided as speech under diverse acoustic
conditions. Using RePOPE-Spk, we systematically evaluate both proprietary and
open-source models. Experimental results show that hallucinations escalate when
queries are spoken rather than written: error rates increase by 3% under clean
speech and by up to 20% with environmental noise. Input order and query length
further affect robustness, while strategies such as many-shot prompting and
chain-of-thought reasoning offer partial but insufficient mitigation. These
findings highlight a critical and underexplored challenge, opening new
directions for building reliable voice interface systems.

Motivation: 提升音频驱动的会说话头部生成的速度和视觉保真度。

Method: 框架分静态高斯初始化和音频驱动变形两阶段，分别用多分辨率哈希三平面和KAN提取特征、构建高斯表示，用ESAA模块融合音频和空间线索，KAN预测变形。

Result: EGSTalker渲染质量和唇形同步精度与现有方法相当，但推理速度大幅超越。

Conclusion: EGSTalker在实时多媒体应用中有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents EGSTalker, a real-time audio-driven talking head
generation framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Designed to enhance
both speed and visual fidelity, EGSTalker requires only 3-5 minutes of training
video to synthesize high-quality facial animations. The framework comprises two
key stages: static Gaussian initialization and audio-driven deformation. In the
first stage, a multi-resolution hash triplane and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(KAN) are used to extract spatial features and construct a compact 3D Gaussian
representation. In the second stage, we propose an Efficient Spatial-Audio
Attention (ESAA) module to fuse audio and spatial cues, while KAN predicts the
corresponding Gaussian deformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
EGSTalker achieves rendering quality and lip-sync accuracy comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, while significantly outperforming them in inference
speed. These results highlight EGSTalker's potential for real-time multimedia
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有带细粒度控制信号的文本到音频生成方法受数据稀缺限制，大规模生成性能不佳。

Method: 将可控文本到音频生成视为多任务学习问题，采用渐进扩散建模方法，包括数据构建、模型训练（预训练扩散变压器并逐步集成特征）和推理阶段的渐进引导生成。

Result: ControlAudio在时间准确性和语音清晰度上达到了SOTA，在主客观评估中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ControlAudio方法在可控文本到音频生成任务中表现出色，有效解决了现有方法的问题。

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g.,
precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in
recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation
performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast
controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a
progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits
distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text,
timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we
propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation,
augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme.
Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT)
on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then
incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic
representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we
propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more
fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling
nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity,
significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective
evaluations. Demo samples are available at:

Result: 合成超500小时高质量中文歌唱数据，实验验证方法可行。

Conclusion: 所提方法实现了可扩展、无对齐且高保真的SVS。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates
strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model
scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of
human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse
LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over
500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we
propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm,
systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity.
Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates
phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention
within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or
uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables
scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new training strategy to improve speech
dereverberation systems in an unsupervised manner using only reverberant
speech. Most existing algorithms rely on paired dry/reverberant data, which is
difficult to obtain. Our approach uses limited acoustic information, like the
reverberation time (RT60), to train a dereverberation system. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves more consistent performance across
various objective metrics than the state-of-the-art.

Result: 在未见的嘈杂和跨语料库语音样本上评估，模型在挑战性条件下性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效。

Abstract: Effectiveness of speech emotion recognition in real-world scenarios is often
hindered by noisy environments and variability across datasets. This paper
introduces a two-step approach to enhance the robustness and generalization of
speech emotion recognition models through improved representation learning.
First, our model employs EDRL (Emotion-Disentangled Representation Learning) to
extract class-specific discriminative features while preserving shared
similarities across emotion categories. Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding
Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint
discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original
speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an
emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and
are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples. Improved
performance under these challenging conditions demonstrates the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Result: MMAudioSep性能优于基线模型，微调后仍保留视频到音频生成能力。

Conclusion: 基础声音生成模型有潜力用于声音相关下游任务。

Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound
separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging
knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a
pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently,
i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the
performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models,
including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and
find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the
model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This
highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted
for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: The evolution of space technology in recent years, fueled by advancements in
computing such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), has
profoundly transformed our capacity to explore the cosmos. Missions like the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects
more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As
part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric
absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be
based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data
generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the
climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS).
In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of
simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of
the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to
identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed
to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so
that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric
absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better
understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and
habitability.

Abstract: Changepoint localization aims to provide confidence sets for a changepoint
(if one exists). Existing methods either relying on strong parametric
assumptions or providing only asymptotic guarantees or focusing on a particular
kind of change(e.g., change in the mean) rather than the entire distributional
change. A method (possibly the first) to achieve distribution-free changepoint
localization with finite-sample validity was recently introduced by
\cite{dandapanthula2025conformal}. However, while they proved finite sample
coverage, there was no analysis of set size. In this work, we provide rigorous
theoretical guarantees for their algorithm. We also show the consistency of a
point estimator for change, and derive its convergence rate without
distributional assumptions. Along that line, we also construct a
distribution-free consistent test to assess whether a particular time point is
a changepoint or not. Thus, our work provides unified distribution-free
guarantees for changepoint detection, localization, and testing. In addition,
we present various finite sample and asymptotic properties of the conformal
$p$-value in the distribution change setup, which provides a theoretical
foundation for many applications of the conformal $p$-value. As an application
of these properties, we construct distribution-free consistent tests for
exchangeability against distribution-change alternatives and a new,
computationally tractable method of optimizing the powers of conformal tests.
We run detailed simulation studies to corroborate the performance of our
methods and theoretical results. Together, our contributions offer a
comprehensive and theoretically principled approach to distribution-free
changepoint inference, broadening both the scope and credibility of conformal
methods in modern changepoint analysis.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the multiparty equality problem in graphs, where
every vertex of a graph $G$ is given an input, and the goal of the vertices is
to decide whether all inputs are equal. We study this problem in the local
broadcast model, where a message sent by a vertex is received by all its
neighbors and the total cost of a protocol is the sum of the lengths of the
messages sent by the vertices. This setting was studied by Khan and Vaidya, who
gave in 2021 a protocol achieving a 4-approximation in the general case.
  We study this multiparty communication problem through the lens of network
topology. We design a new protocol for 2-connected graphs, whose efficiency
relies on the notion of total vertex cover in graph theory. This protocol
outperforms the aforementioned 4-approximation in a number of cases. To
demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to obtain optimal or asymptotically
optimal protocols for several natural network topologies such as cycles,
hypercubes, and grids. On the way we also provide new bounds of independent
interest on the size of total vertex covers in regular graphs.

Abstract: We propose a novel polyhedral uncertainty set for robust optimization, termed
the smooth uncertainty set, which captures dependencies of uncertain parameters
by constraining their pairwise differences. The bounds on these differences may
be dictated by the underlying physics of the problem and may be expressed by
domain experts. When correlations are available, the bounds can be set
  to ensure that the associated probabilistic constraints are satisfied for any
given probability. We explore specialized solution methods for the resulting
optimization problems, including compact reformulations that exploit special
structures when
  they appear, a column generation algorithm, and a reformulation of the
adversarial problem as a minimum-cost flow problem. Our numerical experiments,
based on problems from literature, illustrate (i) that the performance of the
smooth uncertainty set model solution is similar to that of the ellipsoidal
uncertainty model solution, albeit, it is computed within significantly shorter
running times, and (ii) our column-generation algorithm can outperform the
classical cutting plane algorithm and dualized reformulation, respectively in
terms of solution time and memory consumption.

Abstract: Fully capturing this behavior in traditional homogenized tissue testing
requires the excitation of multiple deformation modes, i.e. combined triaxial
shear tests and biaxial stretch tests. Inherently, such multimodal experimental
protocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample
manipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced
tissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue
behavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention
to the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation
problem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the
automated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter
identification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a
Bayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We
showcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the
material model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single
heterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the
ground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work
highlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic
material models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty
quantification.

TL;DR: 本文研究粘性流体中紧凑型滑翔器通过调整质心导航，发现两种依赖颗粒雷诺数的最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人造滑翔器在流体中沉降时需精确导航以到达目标位置，研究其导航策略。

Method: 采用完全解析的直接数值模拟（DNS）和强化学习方法。

Result: 发现两种最优导航策略，策略与颗粒雷诺数Re$_p$相关；大Re$_p$时，滑翔器通过质心移动快速翻滚产生大水平惯性升力；小Re$_p$时，通过调整质心以稳定倾斜姿态沉降产生小水平粘性力。

Conclusion: 解释了最优策略与Re$_p$的关系，不同Re$_p$下滑翔器有不同导航方式和水平移动距离。

Abstract: Artificial gliders are designed to disperse as they settle through a fluid,
requiring precise navigation to reach target locations. We show that a compact
glider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its
centre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and
reinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow
the glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend
sensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature
of this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our
results explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$,
the glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its
orientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force,
which allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high
viscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its
centre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that
results in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller
than for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the
inertial lift force at large Re$_p$.

### [315] [Generating CodeMeta using declarative mapping rules: An open-ended approach using ShExML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09172)
*Herminio García-González*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 本文提出用声明式映射规则生成CodeMeta文件，以提高研究软件元数据表示的标准化和灵活性，促进CodeMeta采用和研究软件FAIR性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究软件实验要可复现需遵循FAIR原则，其元数据表示缺乏统一标准，现有工具生成CodeMeta文件灵活性和适应性不足。

Method: 使用声明式映射规则，在ShExML中实现三个交叉映射，扩展合并以生成两个现有研究软件制品的CodeMeta文件，用SHACL和ShEx验证输出，自动化生成工作流。

Result: 实现了CodeMeta文件的生成，输出通过验证，生成工作流自动化且新发布版本时用户干预少。

Conclusion: 该工作可作为示例，便于开发者在仓库中纳入CodeMeta生成工作流，促进CodeMeta采用，提高研究软件FAIR性。

Abstract: Nowadays, software is one of the cornerstones when conducting research in
several scientific fields which employ computer-based methodologies to answer
new research questions. However, for these experiments to be completely
reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its
metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across
different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was
proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified
and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate
CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and
adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping
rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of
three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the
generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts.
Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole
generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new
version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which
other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their
repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing
research software FAIRness.

Method: 通过合适的隔室模型结合不确定性生成合成数据，用现有数据校准模型，与深度学习技术结合产生更多训练数据。

Result: 在增强数据集上训练的神经网络预测性能显著提升；NAR适合短期预测，PINNs能捕捉长期定性行为。

Conclusion: 提出的数据增强策略有效，不同神经网络架构有不同适用场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a data augmentation strategy aimed at improving the
training phase of neural networks and, consequently, the accuracy of their
predictions. Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a
suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty.
The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further
integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data
for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented
datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in
particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR
approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing
accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and
avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints
into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative
predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system,
making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical
simulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region
(Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 简单的全局信号可重塑激励以实现弹性合作，为社会技术系统中的多智能体强化学习提供新范式。

Abstract: Inspired by the principle of self-regulating cooperation in collective
institutions, we propose the Group Relative Policy Optimization with Global
Cooperation Constraint (GRPO-GCC) framework. This work is the first to
introduce GRPO into spatial public goods games, establishing a new deep
reinforcement learning baseline for structured populations. GRPO-GCC integrates
group relative policy optimization with a global cooperation constraint that
strengthens incentives at intermediate cooperation levels while weakening them
at extremes. This mechanism aligns local decision making with sustainable
collective outcomes and prevents collapse into either universal defection or
unconditional cooperation. The framework advances beyond existing approaches by
combining group-normalized advantage estimation, a reference-anchored KL
penalty, and a global incentive term that dynamically adjusts cooperative
payoffs. As a result, it achieves accelerated cooperation onset, stabilized
policy adaptation, and long-term sustainability. GRPO-GCC demonstrates how a
simple yet global signal can reshape incentives toward resilient cooperation,
and provides a new paradigm for multi-agent reinforcement learning in
socio-technical systems.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex, multifaceted challenge to
patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and
dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising
avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing
singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support
without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological
framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic
Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of
a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address
a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and
multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data
interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,
interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver
and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced
Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of
each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large
language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration
frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded
responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,
and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural
blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond
single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework
establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and
proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for
future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient
outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.

Conclusion: 所提混合框架能有效解决多智能体路径规划问题，在大规模场景有良好表现。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and
autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while
avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global
information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality
solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to
the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,
distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based
methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information
availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these
limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path
planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to
adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static
conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared
information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We
empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its
planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing
compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently
finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios
having higher agent counts.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决基础模型的局限性，实现快速且物理有效的生物分子相互作用建模。

Abstract: Biomolecular interaction modeling has been substantially advanced by
foundation models, yet they often produce all-atom structures that violate
basic steric feasibility. We address this limitation by enforcing physical
validity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a
uniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the
provisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically
valid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme,
which exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable
and fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients,
our module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end
ffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising
steps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically
valid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model
achieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion
baselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while
guaranteeing physical validity.

Motivation: 量子计算威胁传统加密算法安全，区块链常用算法易受量子攻击，而PQC在区块链环境中的计算开销尚待研究。

Method: 提出在区块链环境中对PQC和传统加密算法进行基准测试的方法，测量不同计算环境下的签名生成和验证时间并进行大规模模拟。

Result: PQC算法在安全级别1时性能开销较小，在较高安全级别某些场景下显著优于ECDSA，如ML - DSA在ARM笔记本5级安全下验证时间优于ECDSA。

Conclusion: 提出的基准测试方法有效，PQC在区块链场景有应用潜力，开源实现可促进后续研究。

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of traditional
encryption algorithms, motivating the development of post-quantum cryptography
(PQC). In 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
standardized several PQC algorithms, marking an important milestone in the
transition toward quantum-resistant security. Blockchain systems fundamentally
rely on cryptographic primitives to guarantee data integrity and transaction
authenticity. However, widely used algorithms such as ECDSA, employed in
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other networks, are vulnerable to quantum attacks.
Although adopting PQC is essential for long-term security, its computational
overhead in blockchain environments remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we propose a methodology for benchmarking both PQC and traditional
cryptographic algorithms in blockchain contexts. We measure signature
generation and verification times across diverse computational environments and
simulate their impact at scale. Our evaluation focuses on PQC digital signature
schemes (ML-DSA, Dilithium, Falcon, Mayo, SLH-DSA, SPHINCS+, and Cross) across
security levels 1 to 5, comparing them to ECDSA, the current standard in
Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate that PQC algorithms introduce only
minor performance overhead at security level 1, while in some scenarios they
significantly outperform ECDSA at higher security levels. For instance, ML-DSA
achieves a verification time of 0.14 ms on an ARM-based laptop at level 5,
compared to 0.88 ms for ECDSA. We also provide an open-source implementation to
ensure reproducibility and encourage further research.

Abstract: Ensuring ballot secrecy is critical for fair and trustworthy electronic
voting systems, yet achieving strong secrecy guarantees in decentralized,
large-scale elections remains challenging. This paper proposes the concept of
collectively secure voting, in which voters themselves can opt in as secret
holders to protect ballot secrecy. A practical blockchain-based collectively
secure voting system is designed and implemented. Our design strikes a balance
between strong confidentiality guarantees and real-world applicability. The
proposed system combines threshold cryptography and smart contracts to ensure
ballots remain confidential during voting, while all protocol steps remain
transparent and verifiable. Voters can use the system without prior blockchain
knowledge through an intuitive user interface that hides underlying complexity.
To evaluate this approach, a user testing is conducted. Results show a high
willingness to act as secret holders, reliable participation in share release,
and high security confidence in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate
that voters can collectively maintain secrecy and that such a practical
deployment is feasible.

Abstract: As cloud infrastructure evolves to support dynamic and distributed workflows,
accelerated now by AI-driven processes, the outdated model of standing
permissions has become a critical vulnerability. Based on the Cloud Security
Alliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our
analysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches.
While current security tools are addressing network and API security, the
challenge of securing granular data access remains. Removing standing
permissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level,
especially for companies handling valuable data at scale.
  In this white paper, we introduce an innovative architecture based on
on-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero
Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level.
We replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce
proactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested
on-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual
records instead of datasets. This solution drastically reduces the attack
surface, prevents privilege creep, and simplifies auditing, offering a vital
path for enterprises to transition to a more secure and resilient data
environment.

Conclusion: 提出的token级清理方法有效，能应对多种攻击，具有实用价值。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of LLM agents with access to numerous tools and
sensitive data significantly widens the attack surface for indirect prompt
injections. Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current
defenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate
malicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that
prevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach
inspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not
contain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we
propose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any
instructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious
instructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this
approach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the
context of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with
readily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on
unrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic
origin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across
a wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB
and SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on
AgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious
settings.

Abstract: In recent years, data poisoning attacks have been increasingly designed to
appear harmless and even beneficial, often with the intention of verifying
dataset ownership or safeguarding private data from unauthorized use. However,
these developments have the potential to cause misunderstandings and conflicts,
as data poisoning has traditionally been regarded as a security threat to
machine learning systems. To address this issue, it is imperative for harmless
poisoning generators to claim ownership of their generated datasets, enabling
users to identify potential poisoning to prevent misuse. In this paper, we
propose the deployment of watermarking schemes as a solution to this challenge.
We introduce two provable and practical watermarking approaches for data
poisoning: {\em post-poisoning watermarking} and {\em poisoning-concurrent
watermarking}. Our analyses demonstrate that when the watermarking length is
$\Theta(\sqrt{d}/\epsilon_w)$ for post-poisoning watermarking, and falls within
the range of $\Theta(1/\epsilon_w^2)$ to $O(\sqrt{d}/\epsilon_p)$ for
poisoning-concurrent watermarking, the watermarked poisoning dataset provably
ensures both watermarking detectability and poisoning utility, certifying the
practicality of watermarking under data poisoning attacks. We validate our
theoretical findings through experiments on several attacks, models, and
datasets.

Method: 开发GREAT框架，采用情感感知触发合成，通过潜在嵌入空间的触发识别管道，利用主成分分析和聚类技术，同时使用Erinyes数据集。

Result: 在基准RLHF数据集实验中，GREAT攻击成功率显著高于基线方法，特别是在未见触发场景中，且能基本保持良性输入的响应质量。

Conclusion: GREAT框架在创建可泛化后门方面效果良好，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that RLHF is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks,
poisoning schemes that inject malicious triggers in preference data. However,
existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting
their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a
novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through
emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response
generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically
violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a
trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space,
leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify
the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a
high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a
principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach. Experiments on
benchmark RLHF datasets demonstrate that GREAT significantly outperforms
baseline methods in attack success rates, especially for unseen trigger
scenarios, while largely preserving the response quality on benign inputs.

embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and
perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets
raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly
assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing
specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers
can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the
training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the
VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes
predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.
Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO
that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.
In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim
VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and
success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to
successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the
physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on
clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that
the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack
performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and
BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at

### [329] [Prioritizing Latency with Profit: A DRL-Based Admission Control for 5G Network Slices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08769)
*Proggya Chakraborty,Aaquib Asrar,Jayasree Sengupta,Sipra Das Bit*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出DePSAC方案解决现有DRL框架在5G网络切片中未考虑服务延迟及收敛不稳定问题，实验证明其在利润、延迟等方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL框架主要关注利润优化，未明确考虑服务延迟，且epsilon - greedy探索收敛不稳定、策略学习欠佳，需改进。

Method: 提出DePSAC方案，采用基于DRL的方法，融入延迟感知奖励函数，使用Boltzmann探索，在模拟5G核心网络上评估。

Result: DePSAC在总体利润、降低URLLC切片延迟、提高接受率和改善资源消耗方面优于DSARA基线。

Conclusion: DePSAC在实际5G网络切片场景中能实现更好的QoS - 利润权衡。

Abstract: 5G networks enable diverse services such as eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC through
network slicing, necessitating intelligent admission control and resource
allocation to meet stringent QoS requirements while maximizing Network Service
Provider (NSP) profits. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
frameworks focus primarily on profit optimization without explicitly accounting
for service delay, potentially leading to QoS violations for latency-sensitive
slices. Moreover, commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration of DRL often results
in unstable convergence and suboptimal policy learning. To address these gaps,
we propose DePSAC -- a Delay and Profit-aware Slice Admission Control scheme.
Our DRL-based approach incorporates a delay-aware reward function, where
penalties due to service delay incentivize the prioritization of
latency-critical slices such as URLLC. Additionally, we employ Boltzmann
exploration to achieve smoother and faster convergence. We implement and
evaluate DePSAC on a simulated 5G core network substrate with realistic Network
Slice Request (NSLR) arrival patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method outperforms the DSARA baseline in terms of overall profit, reduced
URLLC slice delays, improved acceptance rates, and improved resource
consumption. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed DePSAC
in achieving better QoS-profit trade-offs for practical 5G network slicing
scenarios.

TL;DR: 利用众包测量数据提出不确定感知且可解释的下行用户吞吐量估计方法，分析4G到5G SA演进中吞吐量瓶颈转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络连接瓶颈转移，传统方法难测端到端QoS及其变异性，需新方法。

Method: 利用大规模众包测量数据，验证4G方法并扩展到5G，应用NGBoost模型。

Result: 改进4G方法R^2 8.7%，提供5G众包数据集基准，分析出瓶颈转移。

Conclusion: 吞吐量瓶颈从RAN转移到传输和服务层，端到端指标比无线电特征更重要。

Abstract: Characterizing application-layer user throughput in next-generation networks
is increasingly challenging as the higher capacity of the 5G Radio Access
Network (RAN) shifts connectivity bottlenecks towards deeper parts of the
network. Traditional methods, such as drive tests and operator equipment
counters, are costly, limited, or fail to capture end-to-end (E2E) Quality of
Service (QoS) and its variability. In this work, we leverage large-scale
crowdsourced measurements-including E2E, radio, contextual and network
deployment features collected by the user equipment (UE)-to propose an
uncertainty-aware and explainable approach for downlink user throughput
estimation. We first validate prior 4G methods, improving R^2 by 8.7%, and then
extend them to 5G NSA and 5G SA, providing the first benchmarks for 5G
crowdsourced datasets. To address the variability of throughput, we apply
NGBoost, a model that outputs both point estimates and calibrated confidence
intervals, representing its first use in the field of computer communications.
Finally, we use the proposed model to analyze the evolution from 4G to 5G SA,
and show that throughput bottlenecks move from the RAN to transport and service
layers, as seen by E2E metrics gaining importance over radio-related features.

Motivation: 传统系统控制器策略设计依赖人工，本文希望借助生成模型的进展实现自动化策略设计。

Method: 设计并实现PolicySmith框架，运用大语言模型合成实例最优启发式。

Result: 在缓存方面，发现的启发式策略优于标准开源跟踪中的既定基线；在拥塞控制方面，可生成能直接集成到Linux内核的安全策略。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的启发式搜索为系统策略设计带来了新机会。

Abstract: Policy design for various systems controllers has conventionally been a
manual process, with domain experts carefully tailoring heuristics for the
specific instance in which the policy will be deployed. In this paper, we
re-imagine policy design via a novel automated search technique fueled by
recent advances in generative models, specifically Large Language Model
(LLM)-driven code generation. We outline the design and implementation of
PolicySmith, a framework that applies LLMs to synthesize instance-optimal
heuristics. We apply PolicySmith to two long-standing systems policies - web
caching and congestion control, highlighting the opportunities unraveled by
this LLM-driven heuristic search. For caching, PolicySmith discovers heuristics
that outperform established baselines on standard open-source traces. For
congestion control, we show that PolicySmith can generate safe policies that
integrate directly into the Linux kernel.

Motivation: GAAP复杂性和XBRL文件结构使财务审计自动化和验证困难，大语言模型在结构化财务文件推理能力待探索。

Method: 构建基于真实美国GAAP合规XBRL文件的基准FinAuditing，定义三个子任务，提出统一评估框架。

Result: 对13个大语言模型的零样本实验显示，当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度表现不一致，处理多层多文档结构时准确率下降60 - 90%。

Conclusion: 揭示现代大语言模型在基于分类法的财务推理中的系统局限性，为开发可靠的财务智能系统奠定基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 提出Text2Stories任务和指标，用于量化需求与实际需求的匹配程度，实验表明LLM - based matcher效果好，指标可用于比较不同故事集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估从自然语言输入生成的软件需求是否反映利益相关者需求主要是手动任务，需要自动化方法。

Method: 引入Text2Stories任务和指标，将访谈记录分段，将对齐问题转化为文本块与用户故事的匹配问题。

Result: 在四个数据集上，LLM - based matcher在保留注释上达到0.86的宏观F1值，嵌入模型可进行有效阻塞。

Conclusion: Text2Stories是现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、来源可靠的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Motivation: 揭示TTS中候选多样性假设带来的未被识别的失败模式，推动设计更安全有效的TTS策略。

Method: 提出参考引导的多样性减少协议RefDiv对TTS管道进行压力测试，在多个开源和闭源模型及TTS策略上开展大量实验。

Result: 约束多样性会显著增加TTS产生不安全结果的比率，该现象在不同TTS策略和闭源模型中普遍存在，现有安全防护分类器无法识别RefDiv生成的对抗性输入提示。

Conclusion: TTS在候选多样性受限时存在产生不安全输出的普遍问题，现有防御手段有限，需设计针对多样性压力测试的稳健TTS策略。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

TL;DR: 本文提出HAREN - CTC架构用于语音抑郁检测，结合多任务学习和CTC损失，在DAIC - WOZ和MODMA数据集上取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁检测方法在提取特征和捕捉抑郁线索方面存在困难，且大多仅依赖预训练模型的单层特征，易过拟合。

Method: 提出HAREN - CTC架构，通过多任务学习框架内的交叉注意力整合多层SSL特征，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督，包含分层自适应聚类和跨模态融合两个关键模块。

Result: 在DAIC - WOZ上宏观F1分数达0.81，在MODMA上达0.82，在两种评估场景下均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: HAREN - CTC架构在语音抑郁检测中具有有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

Motivation: 推理优化会导致语言模型任务性能的功能退化，以往对性能恢复的研究多集中于鲁棒量化技术，本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的源头恢复模型准确性。

Method: 提出Recover - LoRA方法，使用合成数据和对数蒸馏在选择性层上学习LoRA适配器，使退化模型与全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在MHA和GQA小语言模型上，Recover - LoRA使模型准确率提升5 - 17%。

Conclusion: Recover - LoRA方法能有效恢复退化模型的准确性。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

Result: LatentBreak生成的提示更短、困惑度更低，在多个安全对齐模型上对抗基于困惑度的过滤器时优于其他越狱算法。

Conclusion: LatentBreak能有效规避基于困惑度的防御，是一种更优的越狱攻击方法。

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Conclusion: 以热点为中心的观点可指导未来多模态学习，为对话情感识别中的模态融合提供新视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）推理成本高，小语言模型推理能力未充分挖掘，现有系统未充分利用自然语言理由作为学习信号。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，用SLM生成理由作为直接学习信号，结合交互历史联合建模用户行为及语义驱动。

Conclusion: PULSE框架有效，能更好利用SLM能力，在推荐任务中有良好表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

TL;DR: 本文提出Upfront CoT (UCoT)框架自动压缩思维链（CoT），提升推理效率，实验表明其能减少CoT长度且提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长思维链推理计算成本高、延迟大，以往方法牺牲推理细节，需高效推理框架。

Method: 提出UCoT框架，包含训练小模型（压缩器）生成富含推理信息的前置思维嵌入，以及用奖励机制优化大模型（执行器）利用嵌入进行短推理。

Result: UCoT保持执行器推理能力，显著减少CoT长度，应用于Qwen2.5 - 7B - Instruct模型时，GSM8K数据集上token使用量减少50%，性能比SOTA方法高3.08%。

Conclusion: UCoT是一种有效的推理框架，可在不损失推理能力的情况下提高推理效率。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

Motivation: 缺乏系统分析个人叙事风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 将个人叙事风格形式化为语言选择模式，整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，用语言模型提取特征。

Result: 应用于数百个梦境叙事，案例分析发现退伍军人叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 该框架能揭示语言选择和心理状态之间的关系。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估依赖结构化评分量表，无法纳入受访者自然语言的丰富细微差别，需利用LLM进步处理定性数据。

Method: 结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目创建增强测试，以抑郁为案例，在真实学生样本和合成数据集上开发和评估该框架，通过计算项目信息经验性选择最具信息性的LLM评分说明。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性上有显著改善，LLM项目的信息增益相当于在原19项测试中增加6.3（真实数据）到16.0（合成数据）个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架是自动评分的概念性转变，绕过了典型瓶颈，为利用转录文本增强传统心理测量提供了可扩展方法，在临床健康等领域有潜在应用。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型缺乏标准化和高效的推理框架，限制其广泛应用。

Method: 将推理管道分解为四个模块化组件，为每个组件集成新算法并进行系统级优化。

Result: 在LLaDA - MoE上实现显著效率提升，批量大小为1时，在HumanEval上每秒超过1100个令牌，在8×H800 GPU的六个基准测试中平均每秒超过800个令牌；比Fast - dLLM快10倍，比QWen2.5 - 3B快2 - 3倍。

Conclusion: dInfer是一个高效且可扩展的扩散大语言模型推理框架，能在不降低输出质量的前提下实现高效推理。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Conclusion: 需要进一步测试语言变化对LLM在各类别响应的影响，并在这些方面进行改进。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories
and improvement in these areas.

Conclusion: CCMOR可用于评估大语言模型中文多跳推理能力，检索增强生成可缓解模型知识缺口。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

Method: 提出包含五种对话模式的Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE - CoA)框架，通过自然对话构建有效多轮越狱。

Result: 在十二种大语言模型、十种危害类别上评估达到了最优性能，发现模型特定模式漏洞和行为特征。

Conclusion: 现有安全训练存在局限，需要模式感知防御。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

Conclusion: 所提出的多温度设置方法能有效增强大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source
codes are freely available at https://github.com/dreamer-tx/LLMNER.

then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for

composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major

Conclusion: 提出的基于OOD的检测框架有效、鲁棒且具有泛化性，代码、预训练权重和演示将发布。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

Conclusion: PARSE系统在信息提取任务中表现良好，能提高准确率和减少错误。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

Result: HDLM能灵活实现，将现有MDLM作为特例，实验显示其验证和生成困惑度低于基线。

Conclusion: HDLM在语言建模方面有效，是一种可行的语言建模离散扩散模型。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中时间和成本过高的问题，探究微基准测试对模型排名的一致性。

Method: 引入元评估指标，研究微基准测试对模型排名与完整基准测试性能差异的关系。

Result: 多数场景下微基准测试不能像完整基准测试一样一致排名；无法一致排名准确率差异小的模型对；比较8B指令微调模型时，超半数成对比较结果可能改变。

Conclusion: 为微基准测试的用户和开发者在评估效率和可靠性之间的权衡提供了可行的指导。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级框架DICE，引导小语言模型修正大语言模型输出，提升输出格式准确性和内容正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理任务中重推理轻指令遵循，且微调成本高、参数访问受限。

Method: 先构建结构化思维链适应数据集，再用双调优策略微调小语言模型，以分析-回答模式生成结构化输出。

Result: DICE使大语言模型输出的平均格式准确率和内容正确性分别提升35.4%和29.4%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DICE能保留大语言模型能力，确保输出符合用户需求。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Motivation: 当前NLP技术在危机场景应用有限，NLG架构生成及时预警消息的潜力被忽视，需解决危机中有效识别威胁和减轻损失的问题。

Method: 从现有危机描述出发创建事件链，将事件与预警消息配对生成数据集，遵循专家指南；开展监督微调、偏好对齐、零样本和少样本等实验，评估模型在分布外场景表现和自动后编辑器效果。

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未明确给出结论。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

Motivation: 现有检测方法在RL后训练阶段存在研究空白，而此阶段对提升LLM推理能力至关重要，缺乏专门检测方法存在漏洞。

Method: 提出Self - Critique方法，基于RL阶段后LLM输出熵分布趋于特定稀疏模式的观察，探测潜在的策略崩溃；引入RL - MIA基准模拟污染场景。

Result: Self - Critique在多模型和污染任务中显著优于基线方法，AUC提升达30%，使RL阶段污染检测成为可能。

Conclusion: Self - Critique方法有效解决了RL后训练阶段数据污染检测问题。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

Result: 动态方法评估更具挑战性和现实性，揭示了现有大语言模型性能与实际临床实践的显著偏差。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信医学诊断需求的评估框架。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

Result: CLARity使响应一致性提高16.5%，准确率提高7.5%，人工评估显示连贯性和专业性有整体提升。

Conclusion: CLARity是可推广的解决方案，能让小模型通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

Conclusion: 仔细审查模型计算过程可从简单错误检测转向对大语言模型推理的因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Method: 提出细粒度低秩压缩器FLRC，为每层确定最优秩分配，并入渐进式低秩解码。

Result: 在不同基准测试中表现优越，摘要任务ROUGE - L提升达17%。

Conclusion: FLRC建立了更稳健高效的框架来改进大语言模型推理。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，在少样本场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: MSGCOT能有效解决现有图提示调优方法的问题，提升性能。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

Method: 构建两个数据集，提出TriMPI三阶段训练框架，包括持续预训练注入知识、监督微调、PolicyRollout强化学习扩展。

Result: TriMPI在端到端准确率、泛化性和抗遗忘鲁棒性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 作为多模态策略内化首篇工作，提供数据集、训练方法和综合评估以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Method: 提出Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP) 这一步级推理正则化方法，设计跨段簇的长度感知加权机制。

Result: GRSP在不过度牺牲准确性的情况下实现了卓越的token效率，在难题上优势明显，还能稳定RL训练并有效跨模型规模扩展。

Conclusion: 监督粒度对平衡效率和准确性至关重要，GRSP方法有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型通过强化学习与人偏好或特定任务奖励对齐具有挑战性，现有方法使用单边近似会引入显著策略梯度偏差。

Method: 提出Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)，利用真实对数似然的上下界。

Result: SPG在GSM8K、MATH500、Countdown和Sudoku等任务中显著优于基于ELBO或单步估计的基线方法，准确率有明显提升。

Conclusion: SPG方法能有效解决扩散大语言模型强化学习对齐问题，相比现有方法有更好表现。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

Motivation: 当前AI代理在长周期交互任务中表现不佳，受人类认知文献启发，需要‘替代试错’能力来提升其在复杂交互环境中的理解和表现。

Method: 引入两阶段训练框架Dyna - Mind，第一阶段用ReSim训练代理从搜索树生成推理轨迹；第二阶段用Dyna - GRPO在线强化学习方法增强代理模拟和决策能力。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ReSim有效赋予AI代理模拟能力，Dyna - GRPO能学习更好的策略。

Conclusion: 模拟在使AI代理在更具挑战性的环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动方面起着核心作用。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在思维链示例下有推理能力，但整理大型推理数据集费力且资源密集，需低成本方法增强推理能力。

Method: 利用90个手动选择的推理实例，在测试时通过指令提示强度进行示例增强，合成不同推理轨迹上下文，在P - TTS数据上微调不同大小的Qwen - 2.5模型。

Result: P - TTS - 7B和32B模型在多个数学推理基准测试中优于先前的竞争基线，还提升了零样本泛化准确性。

Conclusion: 测试时间缩放能有效探索推理模式潜在空间，以最小注释开销增强大语言模型解决问题的能力，P - TTS是资源受限或快速发展领域激发大语言模型推理能力的实用低成本方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Motivation: 现有的评估和基准测试方法依赖全标注数据集，希望在有限标注下高效选择最佳大语言模型。

Method: 自适应选择少量最具信息性的查询进行标注，利用基于评判的预言注释模型降低标注成本。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个大语言模型的实验中，选择最佳和接近最佳模型时，标注成本最多降低59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR框架能在有限标注下有效降低标注成本，实现大语言模型的选择。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Method: 用三段论片段作为自然语言推理基准测试大语言模型逻辑泛化能力，提出结合符号推理与神经计算的混合架构。

Result: 大语言模型递归性表现较好，但组合性较差，混合架构即使使用较小神经组件也能保持高效率。

Conclusion: 混合模型有潜力有效解决神经推理系统的关键泛化障碍。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Abstract: Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key
challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full
spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial
adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally
for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial
inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate
challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by
manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical
weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an
effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success
rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a
six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary
algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the
development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks,
and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.

Result: ConPoSe方法成功为多种形状物体选择接触点，在机器人数量和物体尺寸扩展性上优于解析法，性能也优于纯大语言模型选择法。

Conclusion: ConPoSe方法在合作物体运输的接触点选择上有更好的扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in
various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In
cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects
that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which
only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact
points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this
selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially
with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by
how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose
combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search
to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for
contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a
variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate
that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the
analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

Abstract: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental
uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations. To support autonomous
science operations in communication-constrained environments, we present a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework that adaptively
sequences spacecraft science instruments. We integrate a Bayesian network into
the POMDP observation space to manage the high-dimensional and uncertain
measurements typical of astrobiology missions. This network compactly encodes
dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and
computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are
computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly
validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life
Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network
structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our
method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps),
evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample
accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by
nearly 40%

Result: 最佳模型检测错误准确率达93.5%，分类连续故障准确率达84.1%。

Conclusion: 对人类反应进展进行建模可增强人机交互中的错误检测和对反复交互故障的理解。

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
in HRI.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能让机器人学习到比受限专家演示更好的策略。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks
using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and
sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's
ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup
restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic
arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional
space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to
suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can
a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained
expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of
expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the
demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress,
and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our
approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and
task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12
seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on

Abstract: From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made
remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However,
the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on
stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either
confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking
human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few
standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on
humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and
diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety
involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction,
locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient
human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates
high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile
inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k
trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad
categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy
learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and
limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we
introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to
seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive
performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy
learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend
to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the
groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world
scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are
made publicly available on our project website.

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal
trajectories. However, it often requires either large training datasets or
costly collection of human demonstrations. This work proposes an alternative
approach that quickly generates smooth, near-optimal collision-free 3D
Cartesian trajectories from a single artificial demonstration. The
demonstration is encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively
reshaped using policy-based reinforcement learning to create a diverse
trajectory dataset for varying obstacle configurations. This dataset is used to
train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the
obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and
outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is
validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect
baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory
length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different
obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions. Videos and the implementation
code are available at https://github.com/DominikUrbaniak/obst-avoid-dmp-pi2.

Abstract: Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots
allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother
trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is
often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this
paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the
computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization.
Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to
sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned
Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We
propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with
permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model.
We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that
predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the
SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we
show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered
environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than
existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also
generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing
baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can
be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction
of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach
provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of
trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture
different collision-avoidance behaviors.

Conclusion: 该工作是迈向更具可解释性和安全性的生成式机器人策略的重要一步。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,
outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline
studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection
choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/

Abstract: Robotics research has made significant strides in learning, yet mastering
basic skills like object placement remains a fundamental challenge. A key
bottleneck is the acquisition of large-scale, high-quality data, which is often
a manual and laborious process. Inspired by Graspit!, a foundational work that
used simulation to automatically generate dexterous grasp poses, we introduce
Placeit!, an evolutionary-computation framework for generating valid placement
positions for rigid objects. Placeit! is highly versatile, supporting tasks
from placing objects on tables to stacking and inserting them. Our experiments
show that by leveraging quality-diversity optimization, Placeit! significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scenarios for generating
diverse valid poses. A pick&place pipeline built on our framework achieved a
90% success rate over 120 real-world deployments. This work positions Placeit!
as a powerful tool for open-environment pick-and-place tasks and as a valuable
engine for generating the data needed to train simulation-based foundation
models in robotics.
