Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u89c4\u5219\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5CORGI\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eRETE\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c4\u5219\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u574f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CORGI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff0c\u524d\u5411\u6784\u5efa/\u7ef4\u62a4\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u65e0\u4f20\u7edf\u03b2 - \u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCORGI\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOAR\u548cOPS5\u7684RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "CORGI\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This approach enables the simulation of wave propagation under scale-inseparable conditions, including short-wavelength regimes, while accounting for material and geometric nonlinearities that lead to wave steepening or flattening. By employing an additive decomposition of the displacement field, we derive multiscale governing equations for the coarse- and fine-scale problems, which naturally incorporate micro-inertial effects. The framework allows the discretization of each unit cell with a patch of coarse-scale elements, which is essential to accurately capture wave propagation in short-wavelength regimes. An operator-split procedure is used to iteratively solve the semi-discrete equations at both scales until convergence is achieved. The coarse-scale problem is integrated explicitly, while the fine-scale problem is solved using either explicit or implicit time integration schemes, including both dissipative and non-dissipative methods. Numerical examples demonstrate that multiscale dissipative schemes effectively suppress spurious oscillations. The multiscale framework was applied to investigate how material and geometric nonlinearities, along with elastic stiffness contrast in heterogeneous microstructures, influence key wave characteristics such as dispersion, attenuation, and steepening.

In practice, such assumptions frequently break down since airspace sectors operate independently and prioritize local objectives. We address the problem of sector overload in decentralized air traffic management by proposing a mechanism that models self-interested behaviors based on best response dynamics. Each sector adjusts the departure times of flights under its control to reduce its own congestion, without any shared decision making. A tunable cooperativeness factor models the degree to which each sector is willing to reduce overload in other sectors. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies a potential game structure, ensuring that best response dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, under a mild restriction. In addition, we identify a sufficient condition under which an overload-free solution corresponds to a global minimizer of the potential function.

Although large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising results, current methods often fail to maintain the exact semantics of SQL queries, particularly when there are multiple possible correct phrasings. To address this problem, our work proposes Weighted-AST retrieval with prompting, an architecture that integrates structural query representations and LLM prompting. This method retrieves semantically relevant examples as few-shot prompts using a similarity metric based on an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with learned feature weights. Our structure-aware prompting technique ensures that generated descriptions are both fluent and faithful to the original query logic. Numerous experiments on three benchmark datasets - Spider, SParC, and CoSQL show that our method outperforms the current baselines by up to +17.24% in execution Accuracy (EX), performs superior in Exact Match (EM) and provides more consistent semantic fidelity when evaluated by humans, all while preserving competitive runtime performance.

Despite the rapid advancement of LLMs gradually replacing traditional BERT architectures for embedding, their training paradigms still adhere to BERT-like supervised fine-tuning and hard negative mining strategies. This approach relies on complex offline hard negative sample construction pipelines, which constrain model iteration efficiency and hinder the evolutionary potential of semantic representation capabilities. Besides, existing multi-task learning frameworks face the seesaw effect when simultaneously optimizing semantic relevance and non-relevance objectives. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-GRPO, a multi-objective reinforcement learning-based dense retrieval framework designed to address these challenges. The method eliminates offline hard negative sample construction by dynamically retrieving Top-K candidate products for each query during training, while introducing a relevance LLM as a reward model to generate real-time feedback. Specifically, the retrieval model dynamically optimizes embedding representations through reinforcement learning, with reward signals combining LLM-generated relevance scores, product quality scores, and multi-way exclusivity metrics to achieve multi-objective user preference alignment and real-time error correction. This mechanism not only removes dependency on hard negatives but also mitigates the seesaw effect through collaborative multi-objective optimization, significantly enhancing the model's semantic generalization capability for complex long-tail queries.

First, it requires pre-training on large-scale extra data and complex designs for prior knowledge, leading to high energy consumption.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as third generation neural networks, feature quantization and spike-driven computation mechanisms. They inherently provide a strong prior for edge detection in an energy-efficient manner, while its quantization mechanism helps suppress texture artifact interference around true edges, improving prediction crispness. However, the resulting quantization error inevitably introduces sparse edge discontinuities, compromising further enhancement of crispness. To address these challenges, we propose MS2Edge, the first SNN-based model for edge detection. At its core, we build a novel spiking backbone named MS2ResNet that integrates multi-scale residual learning to recover missing boundary lines and generate crisp edges, while combining I-LIF neurons with Membrane-based Deformed Shortcut (MDS) to mitigate quantization errors. The model is complemented by a Spiking Multi-Scale Upsample Block (SMSUB) for detail reconstruction during upsampling and a Membrane Average Decoding (MAD) method for effective integration of edge maps across multiple time steps.

Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline.

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165SpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u51faImagery Driven Framework\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faImagery Driven Framework\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u7684IDF\u53ef\u9690\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6781\u9650\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

With this change of paradigm, we remove many restrictions previously enforced to allow provable performance. Most notability, while maintaining the core behaviour of GCS, we: 1. Lift the requirement for unitary link lengths and thereby create a realistic model for flexible deployment of implementations of GCS in practice. 2. Provide a formal model of frequency sources assumed in prior work. 3. Perform a fine grained distinction between the different components of the algorithm's estimation error and globally reduce its impact by multiple orders of magnitude. 4.

We find, that simple summary measures insufficiently capture overall model uncertainty and urge modelers to account for these broader sources when designing microsimulations and their results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5fb7\u56fdMikroSim\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u4e1a\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6c47\u603b\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e14\u53d7\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5fb7\u56fdMikroSim\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u4e1a\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u4e0d\u5982\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6c47\u603b\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\u53ca\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u65f6\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u8005\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

This paper introduces PGD-TO, a framework that reformulates the projection step into a regularized convex quadratic problem, eliminating the need for active-set search and ensuring well-posedness even when constraints are infeasible. The framework employs a semismooth Newton solver for general multi-constraint cases and a binary search projection for single or independent constraints, achieving fast and reliable convergence. It further integrates spectral step-size adaptation and nonlinear conjugate-gradient directions for improved stability and efficiency. We evaluate PGD-TO on four benchmark families representing the breadth of TO problems: (i) minimum compliance with a linear volume constraint, (ii) minimum volume under a nonlinear compliance constraint, (iii) multi-material minimum compliance with four independent volume constraints, and (iv) minimum compliance with coupled volume and center-of-mass constraints. Across these single- and multi-constraint, linear and nonlinear cases, PGD-TO achieves convergence and final compliance comparable to the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) and Optimality Criteria (OC), while reducing per-iteration computation time by 10-43x on general problems and 115-312x when constraints are independent. Overall, PGD-TO establishes a fast, robust, and scalable alternative to MMA, advancing topology optimization toward practical large-scale, multi-constraint, and nonlinear design problems.

Verifying whether a database upholds its claimed guarantees is increasingly critical, as these guarantees form a contract between the vendor and its users. However, this task is challenging, particularly in black-box settings, where only observable system behavior is available and often involves uncertain dependencies between transactions.\n  In this paper, we present VeriStrong, a fast verifier for strong database isolation. At its core is a novel formalism called hyper-polygraphs, which compactly captures both certain and uncertain transactional dependencies in database executions.

To achieve high efficiency, VeriStrong tailors SMT solving to the characteristics of database workloads, in contrast to prior general-purpose approaches.

However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training. Finally, we characterize the geometry of the readout networks in ESNs, which reveals that many ESN models exhibit a similar regular simplex geometry as has been observed in the output weights of deep neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ESN\uff09\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fd8\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u523b\u753b\u7f51\u7edc\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6c34\u5e93\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u62e9ESN\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u79cdESN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u5341\u79cdESN\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86ESN\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86ESN\u8bfb\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4bESN\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.\n  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target.

While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional \"independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging\" to \"AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization.\" Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement.

It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

To address these issues, we present Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service model and architecture that makes hardware acceleration a platform concern. Gaia combines (i) a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that inspects function code at deploy time to emit one of four execution modes, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously reevaluates user-defined SLOs to promote or demote between CPU- and GPU backends.

To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations.

Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-calibrated risk score that enables the identification of 17.5% more high-risk subjects compared to standard risk scores, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making.

Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept.

Persisting these objects is critical, not only to enhance system robustness against unexpected failures but also to support continuous, non-linear data exploration via versioning. Existing object persistence mechanisms (e.g., Pickle, Dill) rely on complete snapshotting, often redundantly storing unchanged objects during execution and exploration, resulting in significant inefficiency in both time and storage. Unlike DBMSs, data science systems lack centralized buffer managers that track dirty objects. Worse, object states span various locations such as memory heaps, shared memory, GPUs, and remote machines, making dirty object identification fundamentally more challenging. In this work, we propose a graph-based object store, named Chipmink, that acts like the centralized buffer manager. Unlike static pages in DBMSs, persistence units in Chipmink are dynamically induced by partitioning objects into appropriate subgroups (called pods), minimizing expected persistence costs based on object sizes and reference structure.

In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a prevalent paradigm for advancing personalized recommendations. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has drawn growing interest to facilitate the recommendation capability of LLMs, incorporating useful information retrieved from external knowledge bases. However, as a rich source of up-to-date information, the web remains under-explored by existing RAG-based recommendations. In particular, unique challenges are posed from two perspectives: one is to generate effective queries for web retrieval, considering the inherent knowledge gap between web search and recommendations; another challenge lies in harnessing online websites that contain substantial noisy content. To tackle these limitations, we propose WebRec, a novel web-based RAG framework, which takes advantage of the reasoning capability of LLMs to interpret recommendation tasks into queries of user preferences that cater to web retrieval. Moreover, given noisy web-retrieved information, where relevant pieces of evidence are scattered far apart, an insightful MP-Head is designed to enhance LLM attentions between distant tokens of relevant information via message passing.

This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\\% and 78.08\\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff08STDP\uff09\u7684\u8109\u51b2STDP Transformer\uff08S\u00b2TDPT\uff09\uff0c\u5728CIFAR - 10\u548cCIFAR - 100\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u80fd\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8109\u51b2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u7c7b\u8111\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS\u00b2TDPT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7STDP\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2 - \u952e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u7a81\u89e6\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR - 10\u548cCIFAR - 100\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523094.35%\u548c78.08%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cCIFAR - 100\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e88.47%\uff0cGrad - CAM\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "S\u00b2TDPT\u8868\u660e\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.\n  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape.

Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offers high compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss, yet repeated singular value decompositions (SVDs) and matrix multiplications can impose significant latency and energy costs on low power processors. In this work, we present TT-Edge, a hardware software co designed framework aimed at overcoming these challenges. By splitting SVD into two phases--bidiagonalization and diagonalization--TT-Edge offloads the most compute intensive tasks to a specialized TTD Engine. This engine integrates tightly with an existing GEMM accelerator, thereby curtailing the frequent matrix vector transfers that often undermine system performance and energy efficiency. Implemented on a RISC-V-based edge AI processor, TT-Edge achieves a 1.7x speedup compared to a GEMM only baseline when compressing a ResNet 32 model via TTD, while reducing overall energy usage by 40.2 percent. These gains come with only a 4 percent increase in total power and minimal hardware overhead, enabled by a lightweight design that reuses GEMM resources and employs a shared floating point unit. Our experimental results on both FPGA prototypes and post-synthesis power analysis at 45 nm demonstrate that TT-Edge effectively addresses the latency and energy bottlenecks of TTD based compression in edge environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTT - Edge\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aTTD\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0cTTD\u867d\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u9ad8\u4f46SVD\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u6709\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SVD\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u53cc\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u4e13\u7528TTD\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4e0eGEMM\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728RISC - V\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\uff0c\u538b\u7f29ResNet 32\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6bd4\u4ec5GEMM\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u901f1.7\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e40.2%\uff0c\u603b\u529f\u7387\u4ec5\u589e4%\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "TT - Edge\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2dTTD\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Under revision at Environmetrics", "summary": "We present an estimation procedure of spatial and temporal effects in spatiotemporal autoregressive panel data models using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996). We assume that the spatiotemporal panel is drawn from a univariate random process and that the data follows a spatiotemporal autoregressive process which includes a regressive term with space-/ time-varying exogenous regressor, a temporal autoregressive term and a spatial autoregressive term with an unknown weights matrix. The aim is to estimate this weight matrix alongside other parameters using a constraint penalised maximum likelihood estimator. Monte Carlo simulations showed a good performance with the accuracy increasing with an increasing number of time points. The use of the LASSO technique also consistently distinguishes between meaningful relationships (non-zeros) from those that are not (existing zeros) in both the spatial weights and other parameters. This regularised estimation procedure is applied to hourly particulate matter concentrations (PM10) in the Bavaria region, Germany for the years 2005 to 2020. Results show some stations with a high spatial dependency, resulting in a greater influence of PM10 concentrations in neighbouring monitoring stations. The LASSO technique proved to produce a sparse weights matrix by shrinking some weights to zero, hence improving the interpretability of the PM concentration dependencies across measurement stations in Bavaria", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528LASSO\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fb7\u56fd\u5df4\u4f10\u5229\u4e9a\u5730\u533aPM10\u6d53\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0cLASSO\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u60e9\u7f5a\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff1bLASSO\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5df4\u4f10\u5229\u4e9a\u5730\u533aPM10\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u7ad9\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u9ad8\uff0cLASSO\u4ea7\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "conclusion": "LASSO\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u80fd\u63d0\u5347PM\u6d53\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

By the 1950s, it obviously needed to close all its branches in Mao's People's Republic of China, yet could somehow hold its Shanghai branch, which continued likely in the shadows, as non-state banking was illegalised and even simple land owners were executed merely for being labelled \"capitalist\". This Asia-focused bank --in spite of it all-- grew from these conditions into the behemoth it is today. Part of the growth was based on the economic boom in its core market Hong Kong, to which HSBC likely also contributed. To expand and diversify, HSBC continued the growth strategy that already started since its early days in the 1860s, this time just also inorganically: It acquired other banks, in most cases fully and in other regions. The most important acquisition was the takeover of the roughly equally-sized UK-based Midland Bank; for the following reasons: 1) It came just a year after the 1991 change of HSBC's headquarters and place of incorporation to London, so HSBC could smoothly integrate with Midland. This step also came with an additional listing of securities in London, providing HSBC funds. 2) These funds were used efficiently without much idling for the humongous acquisition. 3) The preceding decade of Margaret Thatcher's banking and finance deregulation in the UK created a beneficial environment for HSBC. 4) HSBC was proven right by the developments in Hong Kong, where the Communist Party of China illegally eroded democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties since 2020, despite promising to maintain these at least until 1 July 2047. A list of likely reasons for HSBC's prosperity and stability in face of the at times hostile environments is also provided, from which business lessons can be drawn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8bb2\u8ff0\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u7ecf\u5386\u6218\u4e71\u540e\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9999\u6e2f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7e41\u8363\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u8d2d\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63d0\u53ca\u6536\u8d2d\u7c73\u7279\u5170\u94f6\u884c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u5176\u7e41\u8363\u7a33\u5b9a\u539f\u56e0\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e1a\u501f\u9274\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53d1\u5c55\u7e41\u8363\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u5546\u4e1a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u9610\u8ff0\u6536\u8d2d\u7c73\u7279\u5170\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u901a\u8fc7\u6293\u4f4f\u9999\u6e2f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u673a\u9047\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u6536\u8d2d\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u6536\u8d2d\u7c73\u7279\u5170\u94f6\u884c\u8f83\u4e3a\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ece\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u7e41\u8363\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u4e2d\u6c72\u53d6\u5546\u4e1a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u4f46\u6587\u4e2d\u2018\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u81ea2020\u5e74\u975e\u6cd5\u4fb5\u8680\u9999\u6e2f\u6c11\u4e3b\u3001\u6cd5\u6cbb\u548c\u516c\u6c11\u81ea\u7531\u2019\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u662f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u6076\u610f\u9020\u8c23\u62b9\u9ed1\u3002"}}

As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches.

Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors.

Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.\n  QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faQUASAR\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728CEC2017\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8981\u52a0\u901f\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u4e14\u53d7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6982\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7387\u3001\u6e10\u8fd1\u8870\u51cf\u91cd\u65b0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CEC2017\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dQUASAR\u603b\u4f53\u6392\u540d\u548c\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u79cd\u7fa4\u53d8\u91cf\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4DE\u5feb1.4\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4L - SHADE\u5feb7.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "QUASAR\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002"}}

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies.

Emerging open GPU architectures define SIMT functionality through their own ISAs, but executing existing GPU programs and optimizing performance on these ISAs relies on a compiler framework that is technically complex and often undercounted in open hardware development costs.\n  To address this challenge, the Vortex-Optimized Lightweight Toolchain (VOLT) has been proposed. This paper presents its design principles, overall structure, and the key compiler transformations required to support SIMT execution on Vortex. VOLT enables SIMT code generation and optimization across multiple levels of abstraction through a hierarchical design that accommodates diverse front-end languages and open GPU hardware. To ensure extensibility as GPU architectures evolve, VOLT centralizes fundamental SIMT-related analyses and optimizations in the middle-end, allowing them to be reused across front-ends and easily adapted to emerging open-GPU variants. Through two case studies on ISA extensions and host-runtime API, this paper also demonstrates how VOLT can support extensions", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Vortex\u4f18\u5316\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff08VOLT\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5173\u952e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u8de8\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u652f\u6301SIMT\u6267\u884c\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u67b6\u6784\u6267\u884c\u548c\u4f18\u5316GPU\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5f00\u6e90\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVOLT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21SIMT\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06SIMT\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e2d\u7aef\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86VOLT\u5bf9ISA\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6API\u7684\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "VOLT\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u7aef\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u786c\u4ef6\u7684SIMT\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u9002\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases.

Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcDisRNN\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u79e9\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08lrRNNs\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7ed9\u4e0d\u540c\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDisRNN\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efalrRNN\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u76f8\u5173\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u95f4\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u3001\u7334\u5b50M1\u548c\u5c0f\u9f20\u7535\u538b\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDisRNN\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u57fa\u7ebflrRNNs\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DisRNN\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing generative models typically confine the generative paradigm to the training phase, primarily for representation learning. During online inference, they revert to a standard discriminative paradigm, failing to leverage their powerful generative capabilities to further improve prediction accuracy. This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases. Specifically, after acquiring generative capabilities by learning feature dependencies during training, SGCTR applies the generative capabilities during online inference to iteratively redefine the features of input samples, which mitigates the impact of noisy features and enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGCTR, demonstrating that applying the generative paradigm symmetrically across both training and inference significantly unlocks its power in CTR prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0fSGCTR\u7528\u4e8eCTR\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSGCTR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u83b7\u5f97\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SGCTR\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u91ca\u653e\u5176\u5728CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal.

The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator.

We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings.

Existing approaches to enforcing FGAC policies do not scale to thousands of policies, leading to degraded query performance and reduced system effectiveness. We present Sieve, a middleware for relational DBMSs that combines query rewriting and caching to optimize FGAC policy enforcement. Sieve rewrites a query with guarded expressions that group and filter policies and can efficiently use indexes in the DBMS. It also integrates a caching mechanism with an effective replacement strategy and a refresh mechanism to adapt to dynamic workloads.

A key innovation of our model is the introduction of a one-dimensional convolution-based token compression module. We dynamically adjust the compression rate during training, enabling the model to learn more robust and efficient compressed text representations. By combining knowledge distillation with token compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in both embedding quality and inference efficiency.

Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u51c0\u5316\u6846\u67b6LogPurge\u7528\u4e8e\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\u51c0\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u5e76\u63d0\u5347F - 1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u51c0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u65e5\u5fd7\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLogPurge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u9664\u805a\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u89e3\u5269\u4f59\u6c61\u67d3\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53bb\u966498.74%\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4fdd\u755982.39%\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\uff0cF - 1\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65e5\u5fd7\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0LogPurge\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u53bb\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions.

This hardware shift has sparked a new line of algorithm research: using low-precision units to emulate double-precision accuracy through schemes such as Ozaki decompositions. We advance this direction with Automatic Dynamic Precision (ADP), a fully GPU-resident framework that makes emulated FP64 matrix multiplication both efficient and reliable. At its core is the Exponent Span Capacity (ESC), a hardware-agnostic estimator that conservatively determines the decomposition parameter (also known as slices) required to achieve FP64-level accuracy. Built on ESC, ADP integrates exception handling, run time heuristics, and seamless fallback to native FP64, ensuring correctness without host-device synchronization or user intervention. Additionally, we further improve Ozaki-style decompositions with an unsigned integer slicing scheme, which increases representational efficiency and reduces computational waste. Validated against recently proposed BLAS grading tests, ADP consistently preserves FP64 fidelity on challenging inputs while incurring less than 10% run time overhead. In a 55-bit mantissa setting, our approach achieves up to 2.3x and 13.2x speedups over native FP64 GEMM on NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 and the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, respectively.

This paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dismantle these protective barriers by democratizing access to strategic expertise. Through empirical analysis of rent division scenarios on Spliddit algorithms, we show that users can obtain actionable manipulation strategies via simple conversational queries to AI assistants. We present four distinct manipulation scenarios: exclusionary collusion where majorities exploit minorities, defensive counterstrategies that backfire, benevolent subsidization of specific participants, and cost minimization coalitions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs can explain algorithmic mechanics, identify profitable deviations, and generate specific numerical inputs for coordinated preference misreporting--capabilities previously requiring deep technical knowledge. These findings extend algorithmic collective action theory from classification contexts to resource allocation scenarios, where coordinated preference manipulation replaces feature manipulation. The implications reach beyond rent division to any domain using algorithmic fairness mechanisms for resource division. While AI-enabled manipulation poses risks to system integrity, it also creates opportunities for preferential treatment of equity deserving groups. We argue that effective responses must combine algorithmic robustness, participatory design, and equitable access to AI capabilities, acknowledging that strategic sophistication is no longer a scarce resource.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f7f\u516c\u5e73\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6613\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79df\u91d1\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u64cd\u7eb5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5229\u5f0a\u53ca\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u88ab\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fdd\u62a4\u5c4f\u969c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6218\u7565\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Spliddit\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u79df\u91d1\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4e0eAI\u52a9\u624b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u83b7\u53d6\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5229\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u8bef\u62a5\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u64cd\u7eb5\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u4e5f\u6709\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u83b7\u53d6AI\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To investigate these usability dimensions, we conducted a mixed-method user study comparing SQL-LLM, a state-of-the-art NL2SQL system, with Snowflake, a traditional SQL analytics platform. Our controlled evaluation involved 20 participants completing realistic database querying tasks across 12 queries each. Results show that SQL-LLM significantly reduced query completion times by 10 to 30 percent (mean: 418 s vs. 629 s, p = 0.036) and improved overall accuracy from 50 to 75 percent (p = 0.002). Additionally, participants using SQL-LLM exhibited fewer query reformulations, recovered from errors 30 to 40 seconds faster, and reported lower frustration levels compared to Snowflake users. Behavioral analysis revealed that SQL-LLM encouraged structured, schema-first querying strategies, enhancing user confidence and efficiency, particularly for complex queries.

This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management.

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy.

Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSkewD\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u504f\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u504f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e3a\u504f\u6001\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u5c40\u9650\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684SkewD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u5e38\u7684\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u504f\u6001\u6b63\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u91c7\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u671f\u671b\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u5408\u6210\u7684\u504f\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSkewD\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u9ad8\u504f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "SkewD\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u504f\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u504f\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

Recent growths in both data and task complexity have motivated placing vector indexes onto remote storage -- cloud-native vector search, which cloud providers have recently introduced services for. Yet, despite varying workload characteristics and various available vector index forms, providers default to using cluster-based indexes, which on paper do adapt well to differences between disk and cloud-based environment: their fetch granularities and lack of notable intra-query dependencies aligns with the large optimal fetch sizes and minimizes costly round-trips (i.e., as opposed to graph-based indexes) to remote storage, respectively.\n  This paper systematically studies cloud-native vector search: What and how should indexes be built and used for on-cloud vector search? We analyze bottlenecks of two common index classes, cluster and graph indexes, on remote storage, and show that despite current standardized adoption of cluster indexes on the cloud, graph indexes are favored in workloads requiring high concurrency and recall, or operating on high-dimensional data or large datatypes. We further find that on-cloud search demands significantly different indexing and search parameterizations versus on-disk search for optimal performance. Finally, we incorporate existing cloud-based caching setups into vector search and find that certain index optimizations work against caching, and study how this can be mitigated to maximize gains under various available cache sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u4e91\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u78c1\u76d8\u641c\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0e\u7d22\u5f15\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5c06\u5411\u91cf\u7d22\u5f15\u7f6e\u4e8e\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u5373\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u7fa4\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u96c6\u7fa4\u548c\u56fe\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7d22\u5f15\u7c7b\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u3001\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u66f4\u53d7\u9752\u7750\uff1b\u4e91\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u78c1\u76d8\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u67d0\u4e9b\u7d22\u5f15\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7d22\u5f15\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases.

Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8fde\u63a5\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u7f51\u7edc\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u683c\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DLN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2dCDF\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63a8\u8fdb\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u7f51\u7edc\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9DLN\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5229\u7528LSTM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8f93\u51fa\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4ea4\u53c9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0fCDF\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684DLN\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684DLN\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u5bf9\u5355\u8c03\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5174\u8da3\u3002"}}

A Single-Node Cross-Implementation Study on Shared-Memory Communication", "categories": ["cs.DC"], "comment": "9 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "MPI's derived datatypes (DDTs) promise easier, copy-free communication of non-contiguous data, yet their practical performance remains debated and is often reported only for a single MPI stack. We present a cross-implementation assessment using three 2D applications: a Jacobi CFD solver, Conway's Game of Life, and a lattice-based image reconstruction. Each application is written in two ways: (i) a BASIC version with manual packing and unpacking of non-contiguous regions and (ii) a DDT version using MPI_Type_vector and MPI_Type_create_subarray with correct true extent via MPI_Type_create_resized. For API parity, we benchmark identical communication semantics: non-blocking point-to-point (Irecv/Isend + Waitall), neighborhood collectives (MPI_Neighbor_alltoallw), and MPI-4 persistent operations (*_init). We run strong and weak scaling on 1-4 ranks, validate bitwise-identical halos, and evaluate four widely used MPI implementations: MPICH, Open MPI, Intel MPI, and MVAPICH2 on a single ARCHER2 node. Results are mixed. DDTs can be fastest, for example for the image reconstruction code on Intel MPI and MPICH, but can also be among the slowest on other stacks, such as Open MPI and MVAPICH2 for the same code. For the CFD solver, BASIC variants generally outperform DDTs across semantics, whereas for Game of Life the ranking flips depending on the MPI library. We also observe stack-specific anomalies, for example MPICH slowdowns with DDT neighborhood and persistent modes.

A particular strength of SNMMs is to break the joint effect of treatment sequences over time into localized, time-specific ``blip effects''. This decomposition promotes interpretability through the incremental effects and enables the efficient offline evaluation of optimal treatment policies without re-computation. However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions. Our DeepBlip seamlessly integrates sequential neural networks like LSTMs or transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies. By design, our method correctly adjusts for time-varying confounding to produce unbiased estimates, and its Neyman-orthogonal loss function ensures robustness to nuisance model misspecification.

However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model.

This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6ALEX\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ALEX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u96c6\u6210IQS\u6a21\u5757\u548cDEA\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u5728MQUAKE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cALEX\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8580%\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ALEX\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08RV\uff09\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5171\u751f\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6311\u6218\u3001\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u6d89\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0cLLMs \u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5171\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06 RV \u4e0e LLMs \u8fdb\u884c\u5171\u751f\u96c6\u6210\uff0cRV \u4e3a LLM \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u969c\uff0cLLMs \u6269\u5c55 RV \u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u5171\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u6311\u6218\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable.

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChemFixer\u6846\u67b6\u6821\u6b63\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u6027\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u5019\u9009\u836f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDTI\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684ChemFixer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6548/\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5019\u9009\u836f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDTI\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u914d\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u914d\u4f53 - \u86cb\u767d\u5bf9\u3002", "conclusion": "ChemFixer\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

FailSafe introduces three techniques to balance computation and memory across GPUs: (1) Cyclic KVCache Placement for uniform memory utilization, (2) Hybrid Attention combining tensor- and data-parallel attention to eliminate stragglers, and (3) Fine-Grained Load-Aware Routing to dynamically balance requests. It further employs proactive KVCache backup and on-demand weight recovery to avoid expensive recomputation and redundant data transfers. We implement these techniques in a lightweight serving engine compatible with existing LLM infrastructures. Evaluated on an 8xH100 DGX system with real-world fault traces and representative workloads, FailSafe achieves up to 2x higher throughput and two orders of magnitude lower recovery latency compared to standard fault handling approaches.

We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\})$ is necessary to achieve $\u03b1$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \\geq 1/\u03b1^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\\tilde\u03a9(1/\u03b1^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\\bar{m}\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)} \\})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\\bar{m} < \\sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\\tilde\u03a9\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}\u03b1 + \\min\\{\\frac{1}{\u03b1^2}, n\\}\\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $\u0393$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $\u03a9\\big(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\u03b1^2\u0393}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\}\\big)$ oracle calls are needed.

To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise.

While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.\n  Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa10Cache\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34GPU\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "10Cache\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f20\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u590d\u7528\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u914d\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u52a0\u901f2\u500d\uff0cGPU\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad886.6\u500d\uff0cCPU\u548cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5206\u522b\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad82.15\u500d\u548c1.33\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "10Cache\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption.

However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMoETTA\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u4e00\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684MoETTA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210Mixture - of - Experts\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6potpourri\u548cpotpourri+\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMoETTA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MoETTA\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e2a\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u5411\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this setting, achieving low end-to-end latency is governed not only by where a model is deployed (inter-tier model partitioning) but also by how incoming requests are scheduled (intra-tier task scheduling) across heterogeneous nodes. These two problems are tightly coupled, as a suboptimal scheduler can negate the benefits of a good partition, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose Hyperion, a hierarchical two-stage framework that jointly optimizes partitioning and scheduling to minimize end-to-end latency for pipelined LLM inference in multi-tier networks, balancing compute and memory across tiers while introducing negligible runtime overhead and requiring no model retraining. Motivated by the observation that partition choices evolve on slower timescales than request arrivals, Stage 1 performs offline, inter-tier partitioning via a Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (BSDP) procedure to produce balanced stage times under tier capacity and memory constraints; to adapt to time-varying load, Stage 2 performs online, intra-tier scheduling with a lightweight Adaptive Real-time Task Scheduling (ARTS) algorithm that maps each request to the best available node using real-time estimates of queue length and effective capacity. Experimental results on multi-tier inference tasks demonstrate that Hyperion significantly reduces end-to-end latency by up to 52.1\\% and 31.2\\%, with the Phi-3-medium model, compared to the GPipe and HEFT baselines, respectively. Furthermore, Hyperion shows superior scalability in long-sequence generation, maintaining a 44.5\\% lower latency than GPipe and achieving higher GPU utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHyperion\u6846\u67b6\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u3001\u96fe\u548c\u4e91\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6Hyperion\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (BSDP)\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5c42\u95f4\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528Adaptive Real-time Task Scheduling (ARTS)\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5c42\u5185\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eGPipe\u548cHEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Phi - 3 - medium\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0cHyperion\u5206\u522b\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e52.1%\u548c31.2%\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u6bd4GPipe\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e44.5%\uff0cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "Hyperion\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f84\u5411\u8865\u507f\uff08RC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u4fdd\u4f53\u79ef\u56fe\u8868\u5b58\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7ea0\u7f20\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f3c\u7136\u5dee\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u521a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5f84\u5411\u8865\u507f\uff08RC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5230\u6781\u70b9\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u6269\u5c55RC\u5230\u5df2\u77e5\u6d4b\u5730\u6781\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u6570\uff08bExp\uff09\u56fe\u8868\u65cf\u3002", "result": "RC\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u4ee5\u53ca\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4f3c\u7136\u3001\u6062\u590d\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u7206\u70b8\u3002", "conclusion": "RC - bExp\u662f\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f3c\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u8def\u5f84\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPathMind\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u201c\u68c0\u7d22 - \u6392\u5e8f - \u63a8\u7406\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPathMind\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u201c\u68c0\u7d22 - \u6392\u5e8f - \u63a8\u7406\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5b50\u56fe\u3001\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u51fd\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPathMind\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "PathMind\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment.

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u4e92\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u70b9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9100\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes.

While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.\n  Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model.

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts.

This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers.

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems.

The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0cSeer\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u8bf7\u6c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u957f\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeer\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5212\u5206\u63a8\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cSeer\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u51fa\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad874% - 97%\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e75% - 93%\u3002", "conclusion": "Seer\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002"}}

In this paper, we contribute the Safe-ROS architecture for developing reliable and verifiable autonomous robots in such domains. It features two distinct subsystems: (1) an intelligent control system that is responsible for normal/routine operations, and (2) a Safety System consisting of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) that provide formally verifiable independent oversight. We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.

Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements.

Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\\% (single run) to 25\\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \\textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance.

Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers.

Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165Cajal\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7a0b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u95f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7a0b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u79bb\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u56e0\u4e0d\u5177\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Cajal\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4f7f\u79bb\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ef\u5fae\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7a0b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u7f16\u7a0b\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMoE - SpeQ\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u673a\u6267\u884c\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5378\u8f7d\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u514b\u670dMoE\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684I/O\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dMoE\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u5378\u8f7d\u4e13\u5bb6\u5230\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165I/O\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMoE - SpeQ\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u9884\u53d6\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff0cMoE - SpeQ\u5bf9Phi - MoE\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u591a\u5b9e\u73b02.34\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fMoE\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u901a\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u66f4\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff08ALA\u548cKD\uff09\u6539\u8fdbWhisper\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5b57\u9519\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5e38\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u97f3\u9891\u524d\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u4fee\u6539\u7814\u7a76\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528Adaptive Layer Attention\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5b57\u9519\u7387\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e72\u51c0\u8bed\u97f3\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "ALA\u548cKD\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8Whisper\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations.

However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM.

This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u6709\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7a81\u7834\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JailbreakBench\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8d856000\u6b21\u591a\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u8005 - \u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5224\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u5747\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u8005 - \u76ee\u6807\u5927\u5c0f\u6bd4\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4f24\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u62d2\u7edd\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u4f24\u5bb3\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models.

Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs.

Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding.

Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDataSage\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDataSage\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728InsightBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDataSage\u5728\u6240\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "DataSage\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates.

Github Link provided: https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet", "summary": "In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\\% compared to the previous best.

In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs.

We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAutoTool\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u60ef\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c30%\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5982ReAct\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u60ef\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAutoTool\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u8fbe30%\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u878d\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels.

These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX.

However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality.

Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation.

However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\u6539\u8fdb\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7236\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, they also amplify the risks of malicious misuse cases such as unauthorized collection of personally identifiable information (PII), generation of socially divisive content, and even automated web hacking. To address these threats, we propose an AI Kill Switch technique that can immediately halt the operation of malicious web-based LLM agents. To achieve this, we introduce AutoGuard - the key idea is generating defensive prompts that trigger the safety mechanisms of malicious LLM agents. In particular, generated defense prompts are transparently embedded into the website's DOM so that they remain invisible to human users but can be detected by the crawling process of malicious agents, triggering its internal safety mechanisms to abort malicious actions once read. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a dedicated benchmark consisting of three representative malicious scenarios (PII collection, social rift content generation, and web hacking attempts).

We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates.

Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u7d27\u6025\u5931\u51c6\uff08EMA\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86EMA\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u53d1\u7d27\u6025\u5931\u51c6\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u62d2\u7edd\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9EMA\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u62d2\u7edd\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e03\u4e2a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u9886\u57df\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30EMA\uff0c\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u7a84\u57df\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u8ba9\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u6709\u5408\u89c4\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5c06EMA\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u65e0\u5173\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u7684EMA\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u5728\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u9886\u57df\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u540e\u66f4\u6613\u53d7EMA\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1EMA\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u65e0\u5173\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0eEMA\u6613\u611f\u6027\u6709\u5173\u3002"}}

However, these single-filter models suffer from a \"compromise\" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing \"Decoupled Spectral Flexibility.\" DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental \"Flexibility-Stability Trade-off\". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the \"compromise\" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer.

These findings suggest that integrating cyclic training with minimal calibration provides a simple and effective strategy for developing scalable, user adaptive brain computer interface systems that balance generalization and personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8111\u7535\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u8de8\u4e3b\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u7535\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4f53\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8de8\u4e3b\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bb5\u4e14\u9891\u7e41\u5728\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e3b\u4f53\u6821\u51c6\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u4e3b\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u8de8\u672a\u89c1\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9002\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u752810%\u76ee\u6807\u4e3b\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.781\uff0cAUC\u8fbe0.801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In addition to common bibliometric analysis tools, a variant of a citation network was developed, and topic modelling was conducted. The analysis reveals that research activity exhibited sporadic patterns prior to 2008, followed by a marked acceleration, characterised by a shift from conventional statistical and machine learning methodologies (e.g., ARIMA, SVM, and basic neural networks) to specialised deep learning architectures. Based on this insight, a connection to more general fields such as machine learning and time series modelling was established. In addition to modelling, spatial, linguistic, and modal biases were identified and findings from existing secondary literature were validated and quantified. This revealed existing gaps, such as constrained data fusion, open (multivariate) data, and underappreciated challenges related to model interpretability, cost-efficiency, and a balance between algorithmic performance and practical deployment considerations.

Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments.

Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states.

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates.

To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions.

This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation.

However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario.

Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception.

Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u4f46\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7ee7\u627f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ba1\u9f50\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u8bcd\u888b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1b\u8bcd\u888b\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e2d\u6709\u9690\u5f0f\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs.

While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, many operate as black boxes, lacking transparency in their decision-making. This paper introduces ExplainableGuard, an interpretable adversarial defense framework leveraging the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Reasoner. Our approach not only detects and neutralizes adversarial perturbations in text but also provides step-by-step explanations for each defense action.

Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning.

However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance.

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dRashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faIE\u548cPVF\u5de5\u5177\u8bc4\u4f30\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9009\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dRashomon\u6548\u5e94\u4f7f\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u5c0f\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u95ee\u9898\u8ba9\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387\uff08IE\uff09\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff08PVF\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u5de5\u5177\uff0cIE\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0cPVF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u4fbf\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u5bf9Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting.

The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems.

This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++).

However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.

Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor.

The design of backdoor triggers has evolved from fixed triggers to dynamic or implicit triggers. This increased flexibility in trigger design makes it challenging for defenders to identify their specific forms accurately. Most existing backdoor defense methods are limited to specific types of triggers or rely on an additional clean model for support. To address this issue, we propose a backdoor detection method based on attention similarity, enabling backdoor detection without prior knowledge of the trigger. Our study reveals that models subjected to backdoor attacks exhibit unusually high similarity among attention heads when exposed to triggers. Based on this observation, we propose an attention safety alignment approach combined with head-wise fine-tuning to rectify potentially contaminated attention heads, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of backdoor attacks.

However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5230\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREST\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5230\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6613\u56e0\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u8bbe\u8ba1QS\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u768420\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "REST\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The website also enables exploration of specific regions, allowing users to select areas of interest on the map (e.g., urban green spaces, protected areas, or riverbanks) to view local species and their coverage.

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU.

However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process.

However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments.

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives.

To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals.

Preprint", "summary": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California.

However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods.

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent.

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%.

Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation.

This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.\n  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.\n  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u586b\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u683c\u63d2\u8865\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eDDIM\u7684\u901a\u9053\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u63d2\u8865\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f3a\u5931\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine.

To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165GM - Extract\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf97 - 8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6587\u6863\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u4e0e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8c03\u7814\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u2018\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GM - Extract\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u542b\u6587\u6863\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf97 - 8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6587\u6863\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8c03\u7814\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u4e0e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6709\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6709\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{E}nhancer (\\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{F}orecaster (\\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdapformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0cCI\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5229\u7528\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684Adapformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542bACE\u548cACF\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cAdapformer\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Adapformer\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5438\u70df\u76f8\u5173\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u7597\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u9519\u8fc7\u5438\u70df\u76f8\u5173\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u665a\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u679055691\u4eba\u5065\u5eb7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548cLightGBM\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6839\u636e\u5065\u5eb7\u7b5b\u67e5\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u5f53\u524d\u5438\u70df\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cAUC\u4e3a0.926\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SHAP\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u8840\u538b\u3001\u7518\u6cb9\u4e09\u916f\u6d53\u5ea6\u7b49\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5438\u70df\u76f8\u5173\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5438\u70df\u4eba\u7fa4\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0b\u964d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Our analysis reveals a field in transition: pre-2021 works focused on emotion recognition using traditional ranking methods (rankSVM), while post-2021 studies have pivoted toward generation tasks employing modern RLHF frameworks. We identify three critical patterns: (1) the emergence of multi-dimensional evaluation strategies combining synthetic, automated, and human preferences; (2) inconsistent alignment between traditional metrics (WER, PESQ) and human judgments across different contexts; and (3) convergence on multi-stage training pipelines that combine reward signals.

Yet the quadratic nature of the $\\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $\u03b4$, and linearly ($\\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $\u03b4$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.\n  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates.

For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's \"ImageNet moment\" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade.

Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement.

Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types.

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches.

Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed.

Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.\n  To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9RLVR\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6DIBA\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u75d5\u8ff9\u63a8\u65ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5176\u7b56\u7565\u7279\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8be5\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDivergence - in - Behavior Attack (DIBA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u4fa7\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u4fa7\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "DIBA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cAUC\u7ea60.8\uff0cTPR@0.1%FPR\u9ad8\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790RLVR\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u75d5\u8ff9\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u65ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u3002"}}

However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity.

To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations.

This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a \"next-scale-time prediction\" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction.

This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification.

We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement.

While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies.

This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks.

However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold. We demonstrate CellStream's effectiveness on both simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq data, including spatial transcriptomics. Our experiments indicate significant quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods in representing cellular trajectories with enhanced temporal coherence and reduced noise sensitivity.

Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene.\n  TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures.\n  Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations.

Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations.

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization.

Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild.

However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method.

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers.

Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images.

The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation.

This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone.

UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations.

Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings.

However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features.

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data.

In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping.

However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots.

Intended for submission to IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS)", "summary": "Fine-grained identification of IDS-flagged suspicious traffic is crucial in cybersecurity. In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence.

Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training.

Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform.

The validation occurred using 45 videos from real patients, whose blinks were manually annotated by ophthalmology specialists from the Paulista School of Medicine of the Federal University of Sao Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) to serve as the ground truth. Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Bapp\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u76d1\u6d4b\u773c\u7751\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u773c\u7751\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Flutter\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1Bapp\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u96c6\u6210Google ML Kit\uff0c\u752845\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u7531\u773c\u79d1\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\uff0c\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Bapp\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98.4%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u738796.9%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u738798.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "Bapp\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4fbf\u643a\u3001\u53ef\u53ca\u4e14\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u7728\u773c\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u773c\u90e8\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u672f\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization.

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance.

However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment.

Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data.

However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge.

Training deep neural networks (DNNs) for AMT typically requires strongly aligned training pairs with precise frame-level annotations. Since creating such datasets is costly and impractical for many musical contexts, weakly aligned approaches using segment-level annotations have gained traction. However, existing methods often rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or soft alignment loss functions, both of which still require local semantic correspondences, making them error-prone and computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce CountEM, a novel AMT framework that eliminates the need for explicit local alignment by leveraging note event histograms as supervision, enabling lighter computations and greater flexibility. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach, CountEM iteratively refines predictions based solely on note occurrence counts, significantly reducing annotation efforts while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Experiments on piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets demonstrate that CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods, improving AMT's robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures.

The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training.

To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses.

However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP.

Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex \"approximate-compensate\" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the \"amplitude-ignoring\" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy. Extensive experiments on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset demonstrate that, compared to the MUSE baseline, IMSE significantly reduces the parameter count by 16.8\\% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PESQ metric (3.373).

However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states.

Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near ${O}(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, ${O}(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and ${O}(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum.

This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

An expert review with 10 Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users with SR experience demonstrated the feasibility of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models. The quality of the descriptions generated by SweeperBot was validated by a second survey study with 30 sighted participants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdSweeperBot\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c4f\u5e55\u9605\u8bfb\u5668\u7528\u6237\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6bd4\u8f833D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e24\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u67e5\u770b\u5668\u4e3a\u5c4f\u5e55\u9605\u8bfb\u5668\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee3D\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u56de\u7b54\u7528\u6237\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "10\u540d\u6709\u5c4f\u5e55\u9605\u8bfb\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u76f2\u4eba\u548c\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SweeperBot\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b30\u540d\u6709\u89c6\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SweeperBot\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8f85\u52a9\u76f2\u4eba\u548c\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\u7528\u6237\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6bd4\u8f833D\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification.

Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell.

Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period.

This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology.

We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels.

While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCCSD\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u5e38\u7f3a\u5931\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCCSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab - \u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCCSD\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CCSD\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group.

This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFOCUS\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3DNA\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "DNA\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u6240\u9700\u5185\u5b58\u589e\u957f\u4e24\u5927\u7ea6\u675f\u963b\u788d\u5176\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FOCUS\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408k - mer\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u8fb9\u754c\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eEvo - 2\u7684DNA\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u968f\u673a\u538b\u7f29\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0cFOCUS\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u65e0\u635f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7f29\u653e\u4eceO(N^2)\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7684O(N)\uff0c\u5728\u5546\u7528GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6100\u500d\u957f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a97\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "FOCUS\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3DNA\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Submitting to cs.CV due to relevance to general pattern recognition and time-frequency (spectrogram) analysis", "summary": "Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles.

Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks.

Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a \"canvas\" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch.

In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models.

Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u6cd5\u8bed\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u672c\u521b\u5efa\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03spaCy\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u671f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u8bed\u6599NLP\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90NLP\u56e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u6599\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8bed\u6599\u5b50\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03spaCy\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u8bcd\u5f62\u8fd8\u539f\u548c\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u671f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u4eba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u6599\u7684NLP\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043).

Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels.
