We\nconsider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and\nsystematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric\nsocial dilemma games.

Moreover, the presence of trust\nincreases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in\ncases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions.

However, their deployment on resource-constrained\ndevices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,\nwhich result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this\nissue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,\ncommonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance\nprocessing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even\ngreater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization\nto harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily\ndue to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly\noptimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that\nintegrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)\nquantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model\naccuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied\nsimultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed\nfirst to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the\npruned model using low-bit representations.

As a result, newly trained models may inherit and\nreinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving\nrelevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity\nScoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a\npropensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given\nposition is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,\nespecially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models\n(LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a\ncost-effective alternative to online experimentation.

Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising\npathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a\n\"unimodal bias\" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of\ndecision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic\nconstraints, often resulting in \"decision deadlocks.\" To overcome this\nlimitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic\nmodels into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous\nconflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional\nmethods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its\npolicy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it\nto generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core\narchitecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),\na training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent\nprogresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive\nsimulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly\noutperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the\nmost challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high\nsuccess rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions\n(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,\nsignificantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems\nfrom its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent\nto flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709CD&R\u7684DRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDiffusion - AC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DPSC\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd1\u7a7a\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eDRL\u7684CD&R\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u201d\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u201c\u51b3\u7b56\u6b7b\u9501\u201d\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230CD&R\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDiffusion - AC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528DPSC\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5148\u8fdb\u7684DRL\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe94.1%\uff0c\u8fd1\u7a7a\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea659%\u3002", "conclusion": "Diffusion - AC\u6846\u67b6\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u88d5\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in\nvarious ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,\ncharacter deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much\ntime students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our\ninability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as\nabstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.\n  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first\nalgorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this\nalgorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual\ntracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student\nprogramming behavior that can now be done at scale.\n  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree\nnodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code\nstates. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student\ncoursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse\ntrees.\n  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that\ncode is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,\na third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with\nwhich students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.\n  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to\nunderstanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of\nstructural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what\nsyntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and\nattention shifting within the code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u6790\u6811\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u7a0b\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u6790\u6811\u8282\u70b9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u6790\u6811\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6811\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u5f00\u5b66\u751f\u6309\u952e\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u6790\u6811\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5982\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u53e5\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u5916\u4ee3\u7801\u5220\u9664\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u6790\u6811\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u7a0b\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u60c5\u51b5\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u5927\u95e8\u3002"}}

Guided by this context, RAG systems can\nreduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer\nquestions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design\nintroduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce\nmisinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if\nretrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to\npromulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG\nrobustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs\nand ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential\nfor harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of\nevidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions.

Our findings reveal that adversarial documents\nsubstantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful\nevidence is also present in the retrieval pool.

Their\nonly means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning,\ni.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of\ndistributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous\nresearch papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished\nwithin this model.

Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but\nits computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of\nfeatures, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent\nstudies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a\nsingle attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically\nreduces SHAP running time.

In this work, we investigated eight\ndifferent Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment\ncompositions affect the explanation quality.

We evaluate across sparse\n(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,\nmeasuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of\nRAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\\% in RAG to more than\n50\\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\\%.

We refer to this problem\nas the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test\nfor a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only\na subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial\ninformation. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem\ncould be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In\npractice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects\nare tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can\nbias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic\nMDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as\n$\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ rate in\nepisodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This\nelevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose\ncumulative regret is $\\tilde{O}(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and\nGaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent\nrewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum\nEntropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data.

Engineers\napply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most\ncommon and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a\ntop-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the\ncall graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address\nthese limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating\nvalid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.\n  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up\nTesting. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not\nsufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is\na systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also\nvalidates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that\ndetected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a\nthree-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions\nand generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and\nextract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by\ncombining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated\nprototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting\nusing a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,\nwhere we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we\nevaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it\ndiscovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities.

Different from other\nparticle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the\ngradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to\nscore-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient\nhigh-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce\naccelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric\nspace of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a\nmomentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of\nparticles deterministically.

For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target\ndistributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an\noptimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by\nanalyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium.\nInterestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on\nthe covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel\nfunctions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target\ndistributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other\npopular sampling methods.

Among them, image-based approaches are\nconsidered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability.\nRecent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant\nperformance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift.\nHowever, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different\nproblems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact\nthat both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and\nresearch from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a\nhybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both\nobfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the\ndiscriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection\nmodule that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to\nenhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an\nouter product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns.\nThird, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls\nsamples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different\nlabels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on\nthe real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms\nexisting baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and\nobfuscation.

PAMC improves\nsample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong\nexploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding\nonly about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural\nreward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for\nrobotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u5956\u52b1\u77e9\u9635\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u89d2\u63a2\u8ba8\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PAMC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u679c\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Policy - Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u5728100\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8d85\u534a\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPAMC\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u73871.6 - 2.1\u500d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea620%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by\ncollecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is\nthen fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the\nlarge language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation\nenvironment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed\nto generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.\nInstructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the\nray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link\nprediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)\nclassification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results\nshow that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved\nperformance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an\nego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the\naccuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance\ngain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,\nconfirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eBEV\u6ce8\u5165\u8fde\u63a5\u5668\u7684MLLM\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4bV2I\u94fe\u8def\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4bV2I\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f66\u8f86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u589e\u591a\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528MLLMs\uff0c\u4f46MLLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684BEV\u6ce8\u5165\u8fde\u63a5\u5668\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u73af\u5883BEV\u5e76\u4e0e\u81ea\u8f66\u8f93\u5165\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408CARLA\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cMATLAB\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u81ea\u8f66\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad813.9%\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u6700\u591a\u8fbe32.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BEV\u6ce8\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5229\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Experimental\nresults on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and\nshort-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMillGNN\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08MTS\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u5206\u7ec4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u524d - \u6ede\u540e\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e16\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MTS\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u591a\u5206\u7ec4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u524d - \u6ede\u540e\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8d85\u524d - \u6ede\u540e\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMillGNN\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5b9a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u524d - \u6ede\u540e\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8d85\u524d - \u6ede\u540e\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMillGNN\u5728\u957f\u77ed\u671fMTS\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e16\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MillGNN\u5728MTS\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d85\u524d - \u6ede\u540e\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on\ncomputer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing\nis overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN\n(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit\nbluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed\nan experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while\nwe log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,\nbut they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at\ndifferent rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)\nis roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the\ngame, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing\nstyles and at the full game of poker.

Despite high performance, modern ML models\ndo not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may\npredict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and\nsurvival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a\nreproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model\nbehavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of\nunderspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome\nprediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by\nincorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into\nthe ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and\nbehavior across degrees of underspecification.

We benchmark BiND against six\nstate-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a\npublicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.\nBiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69\n($\\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model\n(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session\nvariability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up\nto 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses.

In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR\nsystem built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained\nenvironments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five\nstate-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two\ntraditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly\nhand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark\ncovers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,\nlanguage coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and\ndeployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted\nedge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only\nenvironments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),\nwhile Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and\noutperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds\nper image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000\nimages) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR\nsystems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs\ndue to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high\naffordability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2aLVLMs\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f20\u7edfOCR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edfOCR\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u5608\u6742\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cfOCR\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LVLMs\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u5f00\u53d1\u5408\u9002OCR\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u56fe\u50cf\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2aLVLMs\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f20\u7edfOCR\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u90e8\u7f72\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Qwen\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cSprinklr - Edge - OCR\u6574\u4f53F1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfOCR\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ecd\u662f\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Yet, deploying\nhigh-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks\nuse attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly\ncapture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex\ntextures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a\ntraining-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an\nefficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the\nShape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches\n-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other\nusing a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant\ndisease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)\nreached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm\nSTAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention\nmodels.

Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and\npractitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then\nused to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in\nsuch elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of\nhuman decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify\ninformation associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned\nfrom people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and\ncan not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other\ndecision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic\napproach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise\ncomparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive\nprocesses that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work\ncharacterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class\nof models in which individual features are first processed and compared across\nalternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed\nrule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information\nensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent\nunderlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this\nmodeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in\na kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass\nthe accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u5de5\u4f5c\u503e\u5411\u878d\u5165\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u516c\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0a\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u80be\u810f\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u516c\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5148\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u805a\u5408\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80be\u810f\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u4eba\u7c7b\u6210\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u8868\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f5c\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate\nreasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability.

In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and\nCoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:\ntruthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we\nprovide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological\norder, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and\nlimitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for\nreference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for\nenhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful\ncontent detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models\nthemselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in\nsafety, robustness, and privacy.

A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3\nbillion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a\nlatent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned\n(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity\nwaves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution\nclimate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10\ntimes finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous\nevolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals\nsuperior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the\natmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training.

These clues may\nvary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In\nsituations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,\nmodels can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for\nmaking predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,\nwhere patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually\ncoincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations\nhave become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable\nmachine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect\nspurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network\narchitecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both\nsupervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale\nexperiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed\nmethod to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same\narchitecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the\nmodel's reliance on spurious correlations.

Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is\nknown to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters\nin the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise.

Through extensive\nexperiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\ntrained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio\nsamples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,\nunderscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods\ntrained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and\nsignificantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error\nrate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild\ndataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.\nAUDETER is available on GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f15\u53d1\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6AUDETER\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7528\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5047\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6AUDETER\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\uff1b\u7528AUDETER\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "AUDETER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u5728GitHub\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u3002"}}

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency.

Simulated AI\nbias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in\nreal-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,\nHispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups\non quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their\nunconscious associations between race and status using implicit association\ntests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been\ninvestigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or\nwith AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates\nat equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,\npeople also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a\nsignificant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose\nidentities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%\nif people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if\npeople think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their\ndecisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This\nwork has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,\ndesign and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias\nin collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and\nregulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision\nmaking when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and\ndetermining which are subject to oversight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5386\u7b5b\u9009\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e0e\u6709\u504f\u89c1AI\u534f\u4f5c\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210IAT\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u975e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bf9AI - HITL\u573a\u666f\u6709\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u62dfAI\u534f\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9690\u5f0f\u5173\u8054\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08IAT\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u7b80\u5386\u7b5b\u9009\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N = 528\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62dfAI\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u57281526\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u7528IAT\u6d4b\u91cf\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u65e0AI\u6216\u65e0\u504f\u89c1AI\u65f6\u4eba\u4eec\u5e73\u7b49\u9009\u62e9\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff1b\u4e0e\u6709\u504f\u597dAI\u4e92\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec90%\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u540c\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff1b\u5b8c\u6210IAT\u53ef\u4f7f\u9009\u62e9\u975e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u6982\u7387\u63d0\u9ad813%\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u5efa\u8bae\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u6216\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7AI\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bf9AI - HITL\u573a\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001AI\u62db\u8058\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u51cf\u8f7b\u534f\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u89c1\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u51b3\u7b56\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}
