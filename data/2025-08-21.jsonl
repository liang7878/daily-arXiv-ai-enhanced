In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded\nblockchain that balances availability and performance.

PyloChain speculatively\nexecutes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high\nparallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,\nPyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions\nin the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to\nmitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to\nlower-level local members.

However,\nit is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well\nit will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve\ngeneralization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning\nto fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and\ncomputation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of\nparameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This\nmethod builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting\nthis approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We\nreframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a\nset of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity\nof task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective\ngeneralization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a\nresult of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty\nquantification.

For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of\nrelying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done\nfor cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.\n10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement\nthis in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for\nparallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any\nintegrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed\ndirectly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a\nresampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation,\navoiding interpolation artifacts."}

To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,\ncharacterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world\nknowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.\nSecondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via\nfine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and\nanti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics\nto systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate\n16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results\nshowing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual\ngrounding tasks.

To solve these\nproblems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal\ninformation and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based\nretrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong\nSequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal\nlifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we\npropose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding\nto precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user\ninterests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search\nunit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for\nmulti-perspective interests searching."}

For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of\nrelying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done\nfor cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.\n10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement\nthis in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for\nparallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any\nintegrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed\ndirectly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a\nresampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation,\navoiding interpolation artifacts."}

CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates\nrealistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,\nachieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and\nenabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence.

In this work, we examine the notion of\nmissingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline\nselection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the\nlimitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but\ninput-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a\nmeaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a\nVariational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our\nconcept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable\ncounterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data\nsets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more\nfaithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline\nchoices."}

These arise\ndue to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the\nsynchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a\ncomputation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a\ncommunication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because\ncompute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large\npower swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with\nthe increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from\nthe frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical\nfrequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid\ninfrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we\nneed to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the\nchallenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the\nstack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the\npros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged\napproach to solving the challenge.

In this\npaper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,\nwhich modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained\nvector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined\nproblem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that\nSGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide\nbounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an\napproximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.\nThe key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose\nthe sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we\nsystematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for\nasymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with\noptimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the\nvector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,\nimage datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework."}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine\nwhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence\nstructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a\ncausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling\nspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback.

While such scaling has been well studied for\nlanguage modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in\nthis regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,\nvalue-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute\nallocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed\ncompute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes\nto maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between\nmodel size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we\ncall TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for\nsmall models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use\nof large batch size at scale.

This user-centric design allows domain\nexperts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science\nexpertise.

To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to\nachieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect\nrecent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for\nMedicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that\nShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger\nproprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among\nexisting multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities\nlike sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal\nperception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly\navailable. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free\npipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of\nthe deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,\nthe method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it\nattained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th\npercentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard\ndeviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02.

While prior\nresearch has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this\nresearch tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through\ncomprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that\nalthough LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of\nsoftware defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.\nThese defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared\nweaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code\ngeneration methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded\npasswords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple\nmodels. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in\norder to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation\nbetween a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit\ntests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by\nthe number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the\nfunctional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is\nnot a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this\nstudy is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models\nappear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the\nview that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent\ndefects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software\ndevelopment."}

This makes\nthem less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially\nin the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference\nimage to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from\nreference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with\nhighly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight\nas the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate\nimages, delivering more customized illumination control than existing\ntechniques and charting new directions for research in illumination\nharmonization and editing."}

Our\napproach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting\nand introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial\noptimization problem over a Wasserstein ball.

Large language\nmodels (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this\nunstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even\nstate-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages\nfrom across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input\ntokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable\nacross health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)\ngenerating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using\nEHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs\nwith varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval\nor the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds\nthe performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using\nthe models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens.

This\nshift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of\nproactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual\nframework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI\ninteraction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural\ntheories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this\nframework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and\nresponsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a\ncritical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,\nexamining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared\nintentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while\nAI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed\nas a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant\nimplications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda\nfor AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning\nenvironments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI."}
