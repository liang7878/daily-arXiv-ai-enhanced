We build Sci2Pol-Bench on a\nfive-stage taxonomy to mirror the human writing process: (i) Autocompletion,\n(ii) Understanding, (iii) Summarization, (iv) Generation, and (v) Verification.\nIt features 18 tasks in multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Specifically,\nfor the Generation stage, we show that BERTScore and ROUGE scores fail to\ncapture the quality of brief writing, and introduce a new LLM-based evaluation\nmetric aligned with expert judgement. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 13\nleading open-source and commercial LLMs to uncover key limitations. To improve\nLLM performance on brief writing, we curate the Sci2Pol-Corpus for fine-tuning.\nWe start by linking each cited scientific paper to its corresponding policy\ndocument, drawn from 5.6 million policy records. This produces 140,000\ncandidate pairs. We then employ an LLM-as-a-judge to filter high-quality\nexamples, followed by in-context polishing using three expert-written samples\nas references. This process yields a final set of 639 new pairs. Finally, we\nfine-tune three models on Sci2Pol-Corpus: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-12B, and\nGemma-27B. Fine-tuning leads to consistent performance improvements across\nSci2Pol-Bench. Notably, after fine-tuning, Gemma-27B surpasses the much larger\nGPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 (671B).

Recent frameworks attempt to mitigate these issues\nthrough data reorganization or hybrid parallel strategies.

We identify three critical challenges: (1)\nvarying computation-to-communication ratios across sequences of different\nlengths in distributed attention, (2) mismatch between static NIC-GPU affinity\nand dynamic parallel workloads, and (3) distinct optimal partitioning\nstrategies required for quadratic attention versus linear components. To\naddress these challenges, we present Zeppelin, a novel training system that\nintegrates three key techniques: (1) a hierarchical sequence partitioning\nmethod for the attention module that reduces communication overhead and\nbalances computation, supported by an efficient attention engine that applies\ndivergent parallel strategies; (2) a routing layer that orchestrates inter-node\ntransfers to fully utilize NIC bandwidth; and (3) a remapping layer that\ntransforms sequence layouts between attention and linear modules, ensuring high\ncomputational efficiency across both.

Traditionally, low-rank approximations\nare constructed using SVD-based approaches such as truncated SVD or\nRandomizedSVD. Although these SVD approaches -- especially RandomizedSVD --\nhave proven to be very computationally efficient, other low-rank approximation\nmethods can offer even greater performance. One such approach is the CUR\ndecomposition, which forms a low-rank approximation using direct row and column\nsubsets of a matrix. Because CUR uses direct matrix subsets, it is also often\nbetter able to preserve native matrix structures like sparsity or\nnon-negativity than SVD-based approaches and can facilitate data interpretation\nin many contexts. This paper introduces IterativeCUR, which draws on previous\nwork in randomized numerical linear algebra to build a new algorithm that is\nhighly competitive compared to prior work: (1) It is adaptive in the sense that\nit takes as an input parameter the desired tolerance, rather than an a priori\nguess of the numerical rank. (2) It typically runs significantly faster than\nboth existing CUR algorithms and techniques such as RandomizedSVD, in\nparticular when these methods are run in an adaptive rank mode. Its asymptotic\ncomplexity is $\\mathcal{O}(mn + (m+n)r^2 + r^3)$ for an $m\\times n$ matrix of\nnumerical rank $r$.

It is, however, evident that this step\ncan cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.\n  In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning\nproblem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization\nto equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets.\nDefining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning\nmust select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic\nprogramming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased\nbinning problem.\n  Finding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness,\nor it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different\ndistributions.

We\nfirst develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal\nbinning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale\nto very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm,\nbased on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning.

Today, Ethereum's validators cluster along the\nAtlantic (EU and U.S. East Coast), where latency is structurally favorable.\nThis raises a key question: when some regions already enjoy latency advantages,\nhow does protocol design shape validator incentives and the geography of\n(de)centralization? We develop a latency-calibrated agent-based model and\ncompare two Ethereum block-building paradigms: a Single-Source Paradigm (SSP),\nakin to MEV-Boost, where proposers fetch full blocks from a relay that also\npropagates them; and a Multi-Source Paradigm (MSP), where proposers aggregate\nvalue from multiple sources and broadcast the block themselves. Simulations\nshow that SSP concentrates around relay placement but more slowly, since\nproximity mainly affects propagation, and the marginal value of time is\nrelatively uniform across regions. MSP centralizes faster: aggregating across\nsources makes marginal value location-dependent, amplifying payoff dispersion\nand migration toward latency minima. Source placement and consensus settings\ncan dampen or intensify these effects, though once validators are already\nclustered, the impact of source placement on decentralization is marginal.

By retrieving relevant evidence from\nprivate, domain-specific corpora and injecting it into carefully engineered\nprompts, RAG delivers trustworthy responses without the prohibitive cost of\nfine-tuning. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are\ntext-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector\ndatabase. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable\ntrade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global\ncontext; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with\nrecall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and\nrelational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no\nsemantic understanding.

We extend the study to graphs containing cycles. We first show that the\npresence of cycles gives a strong advantage to the adversary: cycles create\nsituations where the algorithm and the optimal solution operate on different\ngame states, and the adversary can exploit the uncertainty in the firefighter\nsequence to trap the algorithm. Specifically, we prove that even on a tadpole\ngraph (a cycle with a tail path), no deterministic online algorithm achieves a\ncompetitive ratio better than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$, where n is the number of\nvertices. We then propose an $O(\\sqrt{n})$-competitive algorithm for 1-almost\ntrees, which contain at most one cycle and generalize tadpole graphs. We\nfurther generalize this algorithm to cactus graphs, in which multiple cycles\nmay appear, but no two share more than one vertex, and show that the online\nfirefighting problem on cactus graphs remains $O(\\sqrt{n})$-competitive.\nFinally, since cactus graphs have treewidth at most 2, we study a variant where\nfirefighters are released in pairs, that is, each round an even number of\nfirefighters is available. Surprisingly, in this setting the competitive\ncomplexity is significantly reduced, and we prove that the problem is at most\n3-competitive.\n  The main technical challenges lie in both algorithm design and analysis,\nsince the algorithm and the optimal solution may break different cycles and\nthus operate on different residual graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we\ndesign a charging framework that carefully partitions the vertices saved by the\noptimal solution and charges them to the vertices saved by the algorithm.\nNamely, the charging scheme is carefully constructed to ensure that each vertex\nsaved by the algorithm is charged at most a constant number of times.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u542b\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6d88\u9632\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u874c\u86aa\u56fe\u4e0a\u65e0\u4f18\u4e8e\u03a9(\u221an)\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a1 - \u51e0\u4e4e\u6811\u548c\u4ed9\u4eba\u638c\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1O(\u221an)\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9632\u5458\u6210\u5bf9\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u4ed9\u4eba\u638c\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u7ade\u4e89\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4e3a\u6700\u591a3 - \u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u5728\u7ebf\u6d88\u9632\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u6811\u56fe\u4e0a\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u542b\u73af\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5145\u7535\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u62ef\u6551\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u5212\u5206\u5e76\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\u62ef\u6551\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u6536\u8d39\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u874c\u86aa\u56fe\u4e0a\u65e0\u4f18\u4e8e\u03a9(\u221an)\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e3a1 - \u51e0\u4e4e\u6811\u548c\u4ed9\u4eba\u638c\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1O(\u221an)\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6d88\u9632\u5458\u6210\u5bf9\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u4ed9\u4eba\u638c\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u591a3 - \u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "conclusion": "\u542b\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6d88\u9632\u95ee\u9898\u6bd4\u6811\u56fe\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5145\u7535\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9632\u5458\u6210\u5bf9\u91ca\u653e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7ade\u4e89\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper provides the very first systematic exploration\nand discussion, together with a resolution proposal, to disclose the many faces\nof surrogate models for configuration tuning, through the novel perspective of\nfitness landscape analysis. We present a theory as an alternative to accuracy\nfor assessing the model usefulness in tuning, based on which we conduct an\nextensive empirical study involving up to 27,000 cases.

Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents\nindependently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often\nemerges among the agents.

However, the time delay in observing the\npast rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that\neven a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of\nregret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where\nthe prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We\nfurther capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time\ndelay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our\nWOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant\n($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge\nto the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in\npoly-matrix zero-sum games.

However, they often suffer from hallucinations in\nknowledge-intensive domains due to their reliance on static pretraining\ncorpora. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nenhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources during inference.\nAmong these sources, textual graphs provide structured and semantically rich\ninformation that supports more precise and interpretable reasoning. This has\nled to growing interest in graph-based RAG systems. Despite their potential,\nmost existing approaches rely on a single retriever to identify relevant\nsubgraphs, which limits their ability to capture the diverse aspects of complex\nqueries. Moreover, these systems often struggle to accurately judge the\nrelevance of retrieved content, making them prone to distraction by irrelevant\nnoise. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose MIXRAG, a\nMixture-of-Experts Graph-RAG framework that introduces multiple specialized\ngraph retrievers and a dynamic routing controller to better handle diverse\nquery intents. Each retriever is trained to focus on a specific aspect of graph\nsemantics, such as entities, relations, or subgraph topology. A\nMixture-of-Experts module adaptively selects and fuses relevant retrievers\nbased on the input query. To reduce noise in the retrieved information, we\nintroduce a query-aware GraphEncoder that carefully analyzes relationships\nwithin the retrieved subgraphs, highlighting the most relevant parts while\ndown-weighting unnecessary noise. Empirical results demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms various\nbaselines. MIXRAG is effective across a wide range of graph-based tasks in\ndifferent domains.

However, the existing LLM-based decompilers still are somewhat\nlimited in effectively presenting a program's source-level structure with its\noriginal identifiers. To mitigate this, we introduce SK2Decompile, a novel\ntwo-phase approach to decompile from the skeleton (semantic structure) to the\nskin (identifier) of programs. Specifically, we first apply a Structure\nRecovery model to translate a program's binary code to an Intermediate\nRepresentation (IR) as deriving the program's \"skeleton\", i.e., preserving\ncontrol flow and data structures while obfuscating all identifiers with generic\nplaceholders. We also apply reinforcement learning to reward the model for\nproducing program structures that adhere to the syntactic and semantic rules\nexpected by compilers. Second, we apply an Identifier Naming model to produce\nmeaningful identifiers which reflect actual program semantics as deriving the\nprogram's \"skin\". We train the Identifier Naming model with a separate\nreinforcement learning objective that rewards the semantic similarity between\nits predictions and the reference code. Such a two-phase decompilation process\nfacilitates advancing the correctness and readability of decompilation\nindependently.

We\nfurther provide an explicit formula for the optimal regularization in the\nidentity input covariance case, and propose an efficient numerical scheme to\ncompute the optimum in the general case.

Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify\nqueries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of\nunderstanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in\nreal-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system\nresponse. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this\ngap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared\nto human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models\ntrained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators?\nIn this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting\nmodel to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user\nintent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history,\ncurrent queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality\nrewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue\nhistory and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the\nrewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost\nend-task performance.

However, existing studies are primarily based on\none-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and\nscales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either\nzero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between\nthe new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on\nthe new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge\nacquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning\nparadigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse\ndistributions and scales arise sequentially over time.

However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior,\nknown as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to\ndeployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study\ncomparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL),\nVehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing.\nUsing a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and\nLiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS\narchitectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios\ninvolving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We\nsystematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three\ndimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity.\nOur results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of\nreal-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without\ncompromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under\nwhich failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the\nunderlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies.

We ran an eight-week\nlongitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract\nguidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that\npairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4).\nForty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5).\nEach session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element\ncontaining a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to\ncompletion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and\nstrategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to\ncompletion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other\ngroups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p <\n0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other\ngroups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses\nshowed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants\ninternalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that\ncontext-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger\nretention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps.

To enhance MCTS with semantic reasoning, we introduce two\nLLM-guided agents with distinct roles: Expander generates top-k promising\nactions based on the current UI state and exploration history, while Simulator\nestimates the likelihood that each action leads toward successful reproduction.\nBy incorporating multi-modal UI inputs and advanced prompting techniques,\nTreeMind conducts feedback-aware navigation that identifies missing but\nessential user actions and incrementally reconstructs the reproduction paths.\nWe evaluate TreeMind on a dataset of 93 real-world Android bug reports from\nthree widely-used benchmarks.

Existing approaches largely overlook these custom allocators,\nleading to coarse aliasing and reduced analysis precision. In this paper, we\npresent AFD, a novel technique that enhances pointer analysis by automatically\nidentifying and modeling custom allocation functions. AFD employs a hybrid\napproach: it uses value-flow analysis to detect straightforward wrappers and\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about more complex allocation\npatterns with side effects. This targeted enhancement enables precise modeling\nof heap objects at each call site, achieving context-sensitivity-like benefits\nwithout the associated overhead. We evaluate AFD on 15 real-world C projects,\nidentifying over 600 custom AFs.

Despite its benefits, existing studies rely\non hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and\nautonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic\nreinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,\ncapable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool\nresponses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step\nreasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by\ncaching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent\ntraining without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,\ninconsistent outputs).

By examining existing optimism-based exploration\nalgorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to\ngather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in\nreward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can\nincur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this\ninsight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries\ntoward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy\nimprovement.

Existing paradigms --\ncontrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --\nbalance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive\nMutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the\nMutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM\nmaximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering\nof codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by\nimposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative\nfidelity. Our contributions are threefold.

However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in\ncomplex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic\nreasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other\nadvanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,\nwhere an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,\nbut is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that\ncontain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively\ncollect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are\ngrade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5\nonly achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning\npatterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the\nenvironment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its\nnearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the\nability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern\nin static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.\nBased on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to\nimprove LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models\nto revisit.

Additionally, the\ncomputational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses\nsignificant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose\nInfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs\ndesigned to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications.

We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition\nmatrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and\ndepth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to\nthat of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix\nas the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal\nmatrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales\nlinearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can\nemulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout\nof size $N \\times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM\nguarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide\ncollection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On\nmulticlass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of\nneural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for\ntime-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid\nTransformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively\ntrack the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of\nvariable-length English sentences.

Its virtues lie in protection against partial nuisance\nmisspecification and asymptotic semiparametric efficiency under correct\nnuisance specification. However, in many applications, complete nuisance\nmisspecification should be regarded as the norm (or at the very least the\nexpected default), and thus doubly robust estimators may behave fragilely. In\nfact, it has been amply verified empirically that these estimators can perform\npoorly when all nuisance functions are misspecified. Here, we first\ncharacterize this phenomenon of double fragility, and then propose a solution\nbased on adaptive correction clipping (ACC). We argue that our ACC proposal is\nsafe, in that it inherits the favorable properties of doubly robust estimators\nunder correct nuisance specification, but its error is guaranteed to be bounded\nby a convex combination of the individual nuisance model errors, which prevents\nthe instability caused by the compounding product of errors of doubly robust\nestimators.

Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves.

In summary, this research provides the\nfirst evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic\ntendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model\nselection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of\nchoosing an intrinsic social action logic.

At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a\npolicy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve\non each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,\noutcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic\nprocess evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the\npolicy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously\nrefine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly\nlarger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,\nthe co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable\nprocess verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of\nboth our own model and other existing LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6StepORLM\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728LLM\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6StepORLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548cGenPRM\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7528W - DPO\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u4f18\u5316GenPRM\u3002", "result": "8B\u53c2\u6570\u7684StepORLM\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7684GenPRM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "StepORLM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cGenPRM\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata\nfor DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and\nfidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that\nexisting approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with\nparameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence\nof task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a\ndata-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our\nkey observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation\nsubspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and\nfidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior\nresponses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby\nensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects\ncomplementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new\ntasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain\nconsistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This\njoint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge\nwhile retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a\nlayer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.\nTheoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that\njustify null-space filtering.

Recent advances in deep learning have led to\ndata-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction\ntask. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures --\nU-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized\nvariant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific\nmodifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025\nSpeed \\& Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers\npaired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that\nSeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the\ninternal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the\nofficial ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of\ndeep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the\nvalue of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\uff0cSeismoLabV3+\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ThinkOnward 2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4U - Net\u3001U - Net++\u3001DeepLabV3+\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u4f53SeismoLabV3+\u56db\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u3002", "result": "SeismoLabV3+\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6MAPE\u503c0.03025\uff0c\u9690\u85cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c60.031246\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdb\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406AI\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we\nfirst build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark\nderived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.\nBuilding on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction\nparadigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of\nmissing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its\nability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of\nobservations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical\nstate. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that\nefficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with\ngeometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of\ncomputational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the\nchallenges posed by varying input combinations.

Existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level\nspatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,\ndiabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and\nvalidation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from\nthree public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and\ninherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and\nF1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers\ninto cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are\npatch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based\nU-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease\nclassification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully\nfine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,\nrepresenting a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%\nand 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the\nmulti-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial\nreasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich\nclinical text.

Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize\ncontext quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and\nintroduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value).

We\npropose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key\nstages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy\nlearning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature\nlearning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$\nacross layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima\ninduced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they\nchange on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we\nprovably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on\nmissing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles\nplayed by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample\nsizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and\ngeneralization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as\nMuon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics.

We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA\nsequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard\nand more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for\nstate-of-the-art models.

However, existing methods do not scale to\npractical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting\nconcepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single\ncheckpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the\nactual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world\nusage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success\nand reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand\nerasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and\ndynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design\nenables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes\ninterference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related\nconcepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality\nconstraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling\nrepresentation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces.

Recently, physiological foundation models based\non Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict\ncritical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA).

First, we\npropose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the\nevent onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.\nSecond, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them\npatient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the\nlargest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the\np-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as\nperson identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we\npropose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary\nestimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as\nlactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via\nzero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform\nlabels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets.

In contrast, individuals' social alignment (i.e., alignment\nor adaptation of internal states and behaviours with partners), trust in\npartners, personal agency, task performance, and interaction experiences were\ngenerally comparable when interacting with agents vs. humans.

Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the\ndiscovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or\ninterpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that\nphysical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation\nprecision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC).

Combining EIC with generative-based\nalgorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving\nsample efficiency by 2~4 times.

However, a fundamental\nchallenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily\nstemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To\naddress this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,\nwhich innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency\ncharacterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs\n(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively\ncontrolling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile\naccuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses\n(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary\nsampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.\nTo enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an\ninput-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism\nthat focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight\nnormalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.\nTheoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees\nconsistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping\nPRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter\nprobability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex\ndesign in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high\nclassification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against\nvarious stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6Zubov - Net\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bbe\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u8c03\u548c\u795e\u7ecfODE\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecfODE\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u65bd\u52a0\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u548c\u9884\u8bbe\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8fb9\u754c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecfODE\u548cLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u51f8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3aLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e09\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9884\u8bbe\u5438\u5f15\u57df - \u5438\u5f15\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9884\u8bbe\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u51f8\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dZubov - Net\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Zubov - Net\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u795e\u7ecfODE\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite recent\nprogress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps\ncompared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to\nhistorical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),\nwe revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a\nfundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss\nlinear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,\nwe propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play\nframework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather\nthan directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model\nparameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to\nprevious task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,\nIVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The\ntransformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information\nMatrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based\nscenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full\ndemonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL\nbaselines.

Rather than relying on manual\nprompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning\n(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as\na reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant\nchallenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing\ndiversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward\nprompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the\nactive learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce\n\\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its\nattacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim\nLLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which\nforces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally\ninduces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses\nbeyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones.

These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object\ninteractions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning\nand low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential\ncapabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective\ngoal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including\ntraditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or\nsparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods\nstruggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a\nnovel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon\nManipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural\nrepresentation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging\ntask-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control.

However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual\nconditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by\ntext prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon\nor imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a\nspecific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.\nIn contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common\nsettings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can\nserve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models\nstruggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low\ntext fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose\nSemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned\nbut semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses\nthe influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while\nstrengthening guidance from the text.

The\nresulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but\ncomputationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images\nand shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures\nor the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an\nalternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein\nspace and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this\npurpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary\nBanach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a\nsliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional\n$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes.

Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing\nthe hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of\ncodebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the\ncodebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers\nshould remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)\nall codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse.

This work presents a comprehensive analysis of\nmethods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,\nwe demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of\ngenerative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity\nlevels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and\npruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require\nminimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's\nstandard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par\nwith unstructured sparsity.

Guided by\nfour research questions, we examine: (i) which applications of LLMs in\neducation have been most frequently explored; (ii) how researchers have\nmeasured their impact; (iii) which risks stem from such applications; and (iv)\nwhat mitigation strategies have been proposed. We find that research on LLMs\nclusters around three domains: operational effectiveness, personalized\napplications, and interactive learning tools. Across these, model-level risks\ninclude superficial understanding, bias, limited robustness, anthropomorphism,\nhallucinations, privacy concerns, and knowledge constraints. When learners\ninteract with LLMs, these risks extend to cognitive and behavioural outcomes,\nincluding reduced neural activity, over-reliance, diminished independent\nlearning skills, and a loss of student agency.

Certain groups, known as orthogonal\ngroups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to\nuncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is\northogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its\ninherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the\nneural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and\nefficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,\nwhile the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant\nmodel and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group\naction.\n  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the\nfunction acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group\naction. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an\nangular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a\nscale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.\nThis decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs\nwhile preserving the underlying group symmetry.\n  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including\npolynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix\nprediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our\nmodel consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and\nefficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e8c\u6b21\u578b\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7fa4\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u7fa4\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7fa4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e9\u9635\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u89d2\u5f62\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89d2\uff08\u6216\u4e58\u79ef\uff09\u7fa4\u4f5c\u7528\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u5143\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4fdd\u8303\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8303\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\uff1b\u5206\u89e3\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}}

We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets\nand automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing\na new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a\nstate-of-the-art $\\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot\nenvironments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves\ntask success rates by over 20\\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the\nperformance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and\n(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.\nThese results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and\nscalable resource for advancing VLA research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEgoScaler\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u53d66DoF\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8eVLA\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u662f\u63a8\u8fdbVLA\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f85\u52a9\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695aVLA\u80fd\u5426\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528EgoScaler\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u53d66DoF\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8eVLA\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bd4\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d8520%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u6570\u636e\u6709\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u662f\u63a8\u8fdbVLA\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

While particle-based\nsimulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference\nremains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are\nirreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail\nto converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator\n(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a\nsingle graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate\ninverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse\nthe underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design\nbased on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling\nforward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and\nefficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three\ndissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS\nachieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the\nparameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than\noptimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed\nof strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates\niterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On\ngoal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex\ntarget shapes (e.g., characters \"L\" and \"N\") through vivid, physically\nconsistent trajectories.

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of\nvision tokens. With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning.

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based\nmethods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient\nand accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing\nICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which\nmay cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence\nof an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic\nenvironments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR\nodometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed\ncoarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the\ninitial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by\ncomparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error\nbetween the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the\ncurrent and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted\nto accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based\non the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane\nadaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,\nachieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.\nExtensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy\nof LiDAR odometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ICP\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eICP\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u59ff\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u548c\u6ce8\u518c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7c97\u914d\u51c6\u83b7\u53d6\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4d\u59ff\u6bd4\u8f83\u9009\u53ef\u9760\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u59ff\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8bef\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u5230\u5e73\u9762\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ICP\u914d\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While existing pruning methods\nprimarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to\nsubstantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel\npruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic\nexperts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure\nthe importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information\nbased on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address\nthe computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,\nHEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the\nsecond-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert\nparameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic\nexpert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where\nd is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward\npasses and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the\nimportance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including\nDeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing\nexpert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and\nbenchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at\ncompression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs\nnearly by 20%.

After going through the aforementioned interventions across\nseveral datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally\nproduce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LALMs\uff09\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLALMs\u4ea7\u751f\u7684CoT\u901a\u5e38\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u663e\u793a\u6587\u672c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684CoT\u5e38\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff0c\u800cLALMs\u7684CoT\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u540c\u65f6LALMs\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728SAKURA\u548cMMAR\u4e24\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2aLALMs\u4ea7\u751f\u7684CoT\u5e94\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91ca\u4e49\u3001\u586b\u5145\u6807\u8bb0\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u63d0\u524d\u56de\u7b54\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLALMs\u4ea7\u751f\u7684CoT\u901a\u5e38\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "LALMs\u4ea7\u751f\u7684CoT\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

This task, known as machine\nunlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while\nmaintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is\nto formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a\nsingle-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention\nlosses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in\nunstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting\ngradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a\npenalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes\nforgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our\nmethod enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a\nsimilarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and\nretention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.\nTo ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable\nconvergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further\nprovide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our\napproach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model\nutility compared to prior methods.

Based on the principle\nof implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target\nmorphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or\ngame-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an\napplication in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval\ngame \"Alias\" with children to improve language skills. Our application\ncurrently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,\naffective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the\ncapacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological\ntargets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at\nthis task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately\nserve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using\nLLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for\nchildren with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a\nrobust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of\nteaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u5b66\u9f84\u524d\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c\u591a\u4e13\u4e1a\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Furhat\u5bf9\u8bdd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73a9\u201cAlias\u201d\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ba1\u7406\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u5f62\u6001\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u5b66\u9f84\u524d\u513f\u7ae5\u9700\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u548c\u5bb6\u957f\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e94\u7528\u8ba9Furhat\u5bf9\u8bdd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u73a9\u201cAlias\u201d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ba1\u7406\u6e38\u620f\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u56de\u5e94\u548c\u8f6e\u6d41\u53d1\u8a00\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u5c06\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u5b9a\u5f62\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5e94\u7528\u76ee\u524d\u5177\u4f53\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5047\u8bbe\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u63d0\u4f9b\u793a\u8303\u548c\u8f85\u5bfc\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5f31\u70b9\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6c9f\u901a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns\nfurther improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes.

However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature\nof I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users\npuzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping\nface controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art.\nAdditionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational\nresources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common\nusers. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model\n(VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low\ncomputational cost.

We address\nthis for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral\nfingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity.\nOptical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and\ncharge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic\nalgorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively\nselected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with\nprocessing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property\nrelationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To\nimprove accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add\ndomain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to\nretain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated\nunder a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature\nstability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built\nfrom expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%)\nby limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert\nfeatures yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance,\nhighlighting productive human-ML collaboration.

Effective operation involves not\nonly physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic\nenvironments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on\ncontext. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,\nactuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,\nand robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)\nprovide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with\nhigher-level functionalities.

To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a\ncomprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from\nWikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by\nsemantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four\nfundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation\nunderstanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to\nmeasure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:\n(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual\npatterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized\nfactual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans\nshortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without\ntrue comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on\nChimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from\nshortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,\nknowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts\ncontribute significantly.

Existing methods like the mixture of experts\nand skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share\nsignificant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal\nstates between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy\nintegration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor\nskills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.\nBased on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless\nand robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set\nof fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions.

Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL\nmodels: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand\nsubstantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive\ndatasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased\ndue to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal\nhyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the\ngrowing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently\ngained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a\nsubset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,\nreferred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original\ndataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing\nrandom sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of\nthe original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias\ntowards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has\ninter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class\ndiversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,\nlightweight mechanism for coreset selection.

While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero\nshot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two\nstructural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB\nimages from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)\npatch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets\nand context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative\nvisual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation\nthat parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop\na scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware\npruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about\n97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations.

More recently, it has also been\nadopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work\non creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not\naccount for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and\nappropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the\nrelationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542\nexpert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality\nvia close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram\nnovelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of\ntop-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,\ncautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike\nhuman-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with\nlower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source\nmodels, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative\nexpressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a\npositive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).\nOverall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave\nroom for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic\nexpressions.

Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable\ndata annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to\nmodels that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality\nand ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the\nlimitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.\nA primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the\ninherently subjective nature of what constitutes a \"good\" caption. We introduce\nCaptioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that\nredefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should\nenable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the\ncorresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM\ngenerates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a\nseparate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on\nthat caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image\ncaptioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple\nsettings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B\nresults in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks.

In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%.

In Stage 2, the model is jointly\noptimized for spoof detection and prosody tasks on both real and synthetic\ndata, leveraging prosodic awareness to detect mismatches between natural and\nexpressive synthetic speech. Experiments show that HuLA consistently\noutperforms strong baselines on challenging out-of-domain dataset, including\nexpressive, emotional, and cross-lingual attacks. These results demonstrate\nthat explicit prosodic supervision, combined with SSL embeddings, substantially\nimproves robustness against advanced synthetic speech attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6HuLA\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5f88\u5c11\u5229\u7528\u97f5\u5f8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5224\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6027\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f1a\u672c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u97f5\u5f8b\u7ebf\u7d22\u533a\u5206\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u97f5\u5f8b\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6HuLA\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9aa8\u5e72\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cF0\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6d4a\u97f3/\u6e05\u97f3\u5206\u7c7b\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u97f5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "HuLA\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57df\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u97f5\u5f8b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Topics: Bit-flip attacks,\n  adversarial attacks, large language models (LLMs)", "summary": "Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing\nsecurity concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks\n(BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can\nseverely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips\ncan degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs\nand reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and\nredundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs'\ncatastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically\nfocus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack\nflexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause\nperturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making\nit not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor\nvalues (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky\nBit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip\nwhile keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It\nis achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined\nparameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity\nand perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight\ndistribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to\ngreatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching\ntaking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma\nmodels, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to\nbelow random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats.\nRemarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a\nsevere security concern of SOTA LLM models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSBFA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4e00\u6b21\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5c31\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SOTA\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Bit - Flip Attacks\uff08BFAs\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u653b\u51fb\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u6d6e\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSBFA\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684ImpactScore\u6307\u6807\u8fed\u4ee3\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u826f\u6027\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SKIP\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u641c\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen\u3001LLaMA\u548cGemma\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cSBFA\u5728BF16\u548cINT8\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4ec5\u4e00\u6b21\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5c31\u4f7fMMLU\u548cSST - 2\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u6bd4\u7279\u8fdb\u884c\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff0c\u5c31\u66b4\u9732\u51faSOTA\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image\nprompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative\nfeatures, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5DIPSY\uff0c\u5229\u7528IP - Adapter\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7528\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u56e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIPSY\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528IP - Adapter\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u533a\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Among them, next scale\nprediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated\nremarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,\nwe revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a\nMarkovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete\ndiffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with\nDiscrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR\ntransformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how\none can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative\nrefinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster\nconvergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.\nAcross multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR\nleads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff08VAR\uff09\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AR transformers\u4e2dVAR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4ee5\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u73b0VAR\u5728\u914d\u5907\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6ce8\u610f\u63a9\u7801\u65f6\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\uff08SRDD\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u5f15\u5165VAR\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "VAR\u7684\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}
