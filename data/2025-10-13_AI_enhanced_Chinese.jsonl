However, existing expansion methods\nadopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring\nindividual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,\nidentical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.\nThis representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to\ngeneralize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two\ncore challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently\ndiverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized\nintent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in\ntopical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of\nexpanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates\nuser-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of\ntwo components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback\nusing user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which\nperforms graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its\nstructure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored\nfor retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench\nacross retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling\npersonalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG\nsystems.

We model bidder uncertainty by introducing a\nprobability that a bidder must exit the auction in each period. Treating the\nsequential auction as a Markov process, we demonstrate the existence of a\nunique steady state.\n  In the absence of uncertainty, the steady state resembles a posted-price\nmechanism: bidders with values above a threshold almost surely win items by\nrepeatedly bidding the threshold price, while those below the threshold almost\nsurely do not. The equilibrium price corresponds to the threshold value that\nbalances supply (bidders with values above the threshold) and demand (auction\nwinners).\n  When uncertainty is introduced, the threshold value persists but becomes less\nprecise, growing \"fuzzier\" as uncertainty increases.

Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance\nsafety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral\ncontrol from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with\nminimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of\nmodels show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially\nlowers false refusal rates.

In this study, we examine\nthe capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating\nuser intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is\nconducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess\nperformance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present\nstudy offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance\ntrade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable\ncomponents in next-generation operating systems.

In this industry paper, we\nevaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test\nconducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our\nfindings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields\nsubstantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to\npersonalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced\nnavigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover,\nour analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater\ncontent diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias.\nOverall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully\nalign user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media\nto adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u632a\u5a01\u4e00\u5bb6\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u95fb\u673a\u6784\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u63a7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6709\u663e\u8457\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u95fb\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u63a7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u5bb6\u632a\u5a01\u4e3b\u8981\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u95fb\u673a\u6784\u7f51\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884cA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u9002\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u52aa\u529b\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u63a7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u534f\u8c03\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5a92\u4f53\u91c7\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6280\u672f\u540c\u65f6\u575a\u6301\u65b0\u95fb\u4ef7\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Its significance lies in converting inherently\ninfinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over\ndual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable\nalgorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent\ntriggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between\nevents--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event\nsequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of\npenalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem\nemerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of\nsimultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering\nkernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels\nevaluated at the data points.

While\nmost existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has\nbegun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.\nHowever, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic\naction spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.\nTo resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which\nreframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL\nencodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to\ntheir original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align\ndecision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)\noperates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state\nmodeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,\nthereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In\nparallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,\nenabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a\nlarge-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising\nplatform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online\ndeployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with\nonly a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for\nRL-based recommendation.

To manage this complexity, previous work has recommended\npre-selecting specific hierarchy questions of interest (e.g., ``among options\nA, B, C, D, E, do treatments A and B have the two best effects in terms of\nimproving outcome X?\") and calculating the empirical probabilities of the\nanswers being true given the data. In contrast, we propose an efficient and\nscalable algorithmic approach that eliminates the need for pre-specification by\nsystematically generating a comprehensive catalog of highly credible treatment\nhierarchy questions, specifically, those with empirical probabilities exceeding\na chosen threshold (e.g., 95%). This enables decision-makers to extract all\nmeaningful insights supported by the data. An additional algorithm trims\nredundant insights from the output to facilitate interpretation. We define and\naddress six broad types of binary hierarchy questions (i.e., those with\ntrue/false answers), covering standard hierarchy questions answered using\nexisting ranking metrics - pairwise comparisons and (cumulative) ranking\nprobabilities - as well as many other complex hierarchy questions. We have\nimplemented our methods in an R package and illustrate their application using\nreal NMA datasets on diabetes and depression interventions. Beyond NMA, our\napproach is relevant to any decision problem concerning three or more treatment\noptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u9ad8\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u5c42\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u6cbb\u7597\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u6570\u91cf\u8fc7\u591a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u9700\u9884\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6cbb\u7597\u5c42\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u53e6\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u53bb\u9664\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u516d\u79cd\u4e8c\u5143\u5c42\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728R\u5305\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u548c\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u4e09\u79cd\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace\nDNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to\nunitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and\nhigh measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped\nregularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine\nlearning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth,\nstruggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks\ndue to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of\nfaithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like\ncognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their\ntouted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with\nquantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions.\nFinally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal\nunfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust\nregularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time\ncompute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while\nmitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such\nas xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which\nsurpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its\nmodest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU.

We have studied two variants of the problem. In the\nfirst variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective\ninfluence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the\nproblem, we are given with $\\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \\ldots, k_{\\ell}$, the\ngoal here is to search for $\\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \\ldots,\nS_{\\ell}$ such that for all $i \\in [\\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \\leq k_i$ and for all $i\n\\neq j$, $S_i \\cap S_j=\\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the\nproducts gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a\nmulti-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization.\nFor solving the first variant, we adopt the bi-criteria approximation\nalgorithm, and for the other variant, we propose a sampling-based approximation\nalgorithm. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard\ndatasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution\napproach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u5e7f\u544a\u9009\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5546\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u63a8\u5e7f\u591a\u79cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u65f6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5404\u4ea7\u54c1\u5f71\u54cd\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u9009\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5b50\u6a21\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u51c6\u5219\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5546\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u63a8\u5e7f\u591a\u79cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u65f6\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u724c\u9009\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Conventional\nalignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also\nmaximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:\nmodels may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer\nconcise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where\nindividually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The\nfundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism\nthat mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic\nAlignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic\ndecision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model\nexplicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs\npayoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself\nand the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During\ntraining, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative\nresponses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In\naddition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic\nreasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM\nservice change.

However, many real-world applications, from\nsignal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent\njoint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely\nautoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they\nsacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for\nmeta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions\nfrom set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented\nconditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal\nautoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our\napproach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The\nmodel processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures\ntarget dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and\nattend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables\nefficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood\nevaluation.

Given an extended regular expression $R$ and a\nstring $Q$, the extended regular expression matching problem is to decide if\n$Q$ matches any of the strings specified by $R$. Extended regular expressions\nare a basic concept in formal language theory and a basic primitive for\nsearching and processing data. Extended regular expression matching was\nintroduced by Hopcroft and Ullmann in the 1970s [\\textit{Introduction to\nAutomata Theory, Languages and Computation}, 1979], who gave a simple dynamic\nprogramming solution using $O(n^3m)$ time and $O(n^2m)$ space, where $n$ is the\nlength of $Q$ and $m$ is the length of $R$. Since then, several solutions have\nbeen proposed, but few significant asymptotic improvements have been obtained.\nThe current state-of-the art solution, by Yamamoto and Miyazaki~[COCOON, 2003],\nuses $O(\\frac{n^3k + n^2m}{w} + n + m)$ time and $O(\\frac{n^2k + nm}{w} + n +\nm)$ space, where $k$ is the number of negation and complement operators in $R$\nand $w$ is the number of bits in a word. This roughly replaces the $m$ factor\nwith $k$ in the dominant terms of both the space and time bounds of the\nHopcroft and Ullmann algorithm.\n  We revisit the problem and present a new solution that significantly improves\nthe previous time and space bounds. Our main result is a new algorithm that\nsolves extended regular expression matching in \\[O\\left(n^\\omega k +\n\\frac{n^2m}{\\min(w/\\log w, \\log n)} + m\\right)\\] time and $O(\\frac{n^2 \\log\nk}{w} + n + m) = O(n^2 +m)$ space, where $\\omega \\approx 2.3716$ is the\nexponent of matrix multiplication. Essentially, this replaces the dominant\n$n^3k$ term with $n^\\omega k$ in the time bound, while simultaneously improving\nthe $n^2k$ term in the space to $O(n^2)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Thanks to the\nsubwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying\nantennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information\n(CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit\nprecoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to\nboost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work\nproposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A\ntwo-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently\naccomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the\neigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two\nsub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter\nantennas and receiver antennas, respectively.

Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this\nproblem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping\ncomputation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that\nfeatures in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always\nhold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis\nfrom the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the\nfeatures of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.\nConcretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,\nexhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency\nbands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor\nsimilarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose\nFrequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)\n  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their\nsimilarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the\nvolatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.\n  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)\ninstead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint\nof feature caching by 99%.\n  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and\nQwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.\nCodes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on\nGitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u5b58\uff08FreqCa\uff09\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff08CRF\uff09\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFreqCa\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u7528\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58CRF\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Finding small sets of maximal diversity is\ncrucial for conservation planning, as it indicates where limited resources can\nbe invested most efficiently. In recent years, efficient algorithms have been\ndeveloped to find sets of taxa that maximize phylogenetic diversity either in a\nphylogenetic network or in a phylogenetic tree subject to ecological\nconstraints, such as a food web. However, these aspects have mostly been\nstudied independently. Since both factors are biologically important, it seems\nnatural to consider them together. In this paper, we introduce decision\nproblems where, given a phylogenetic network, a food web, and integers k, and\nD, the task is to find a set of k taxa with phylogenetic diversity of at least\nD under the maximize all paths measure, while also satisfying viability\nconditions within the food web. Here, we consider different definitions of\nviability, which all demand that a \"sufficient\" number of prey species survive\nto support surviving predators. We investigate the parameterized complexity of\nthese problems and present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms.\nSpecifically, we provide a complete complexity dichotomy characterizing which\ncombinations of parameters - out of the size constraint k, the acceptable\ndiversity loss D, the scanwidth of the food web, the maximum in-degree in the\nnetwork, and the network height h - lead to W[1]-hardness and which admit FPT\nalgorithms.

In numerous experiments, the results\nreveal the importance of the proposed method in hierarchical networks in the\nvisual tasks, and also validate the hypothesis that \"the hierarchical\ninformation content in brain regions of the visual system can be quantified by\ndecoding outcomes to reflect an information hierarchy.\" Among them, we found\nthat neural data collected in the hippocampus can have a random decoding\nperformance, and this negative impact on performance still holds significant\nscientific value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528Allen\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u795e\u7ecf\u50cf\u7d20\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08AT - ViT\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u8111\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d3\u6251\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u5927\u8111\u7ed3\u6784\u5185\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8111\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8111\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Allen\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7684Visual Coding Neuropixel\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed9\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08AT - ViT\uff09\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8111\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d3\u6251\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u201c\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8111\u533a\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u679c\u91cf\u5316\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u4fe1\u606f\u5c42\u6b21\u201d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u6709\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u8868\u73b0\u867d\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u4f46\u4ecd\u5177\u79d1\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone,\nas it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces\n(API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code\ntransformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most\nof the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage\nor support a limited set of libraries and code transformations.

Due\nto the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code\ngeneration and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration.\nBefore building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library\nmigration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that\nLLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps\ncan further improve the performance.

In\nmore detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\\rho$ which is\n$\\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\\pi$, the goal is to output a\nnearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\\rho$. While there has\nbeen a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only\nhandle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we\ngive an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a\nproduct state which is $O(\\epsilon \\log 1 / \\epsilon)$ close to $\\rho$ which\nuses polynomially many copies of $\\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time.\nMoreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To\nour knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any\nnon-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz.\n  Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of\nindependent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient\nreduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical\ntask of \\emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook\nproblem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient\nalgorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product,\nanswering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing\na new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that\ncan be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation.\nFinally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that\nadaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography\ntask, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective\nmeasurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u79ef\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5355\u62f7\u8d1d\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f52\u7ea6\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u7eaf\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u79ef\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5c06\u79ef\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u95ee\u9898\u5f52\u7ea6\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u4e8c\u5143\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u518d\u7ed9\u51fa\u8be5\u7ecf\u5178\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u8bc1\u4e66\u548c\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6001 $O(\\epsilon \\log 1 / \\epsilon)$ \u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u79ef\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u526f\u672c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5355\u62f7\u8d1d\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53cc\u7ed3\u679c\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0a\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002"}}

While cross-attention\nis widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its\nunderlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret\ncross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by\nremoving redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query\ninput by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond\nthe prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which\ncross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query\ninput, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can\nco-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output\nof cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300\nexperiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any\nexplicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal\nAlignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law.

The prevailing\nparadigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text\ninputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics\nwithin KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to\ncorrelate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose\nSemantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising\ntwo key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network\nto extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph\nneighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this\ncondition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,\nadaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,\nenabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction.

The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies\nsustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from\na general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are\nbased on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that\nfail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from\ndifferent domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately\nidentifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684SEER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u5e26\u6765\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e2\u961f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5e94\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u9636\u6bb5\u5f00\u59cb\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SEER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fd0\u884c\uff1a\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u6c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Gemini 2.5\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "SEER\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

The sensitivity of failure probability to change in\nsystem parameters is relevant to risk-informed decision making. Computing\nsensitivity is at least one level more difficult than the probability itself,\nwhich is already challenged by a large number of input random variables, rare\nevents and implicit nonlinear `black-box' response. Finite difference with\nMonte Carlo probability estimates is spurious, requiring the number of samples\nto grow with the reciprocal of step size to suppress estimation variance. Many\nexisting works gain efficiency by exploiting a specific class of input\nvariables, sensitivity parameters, or response in its exact or surrogate form.\nFor general systems, this work presents a theory and associated Monte Carlo\nstrategy for computing sensitivity using response values and gradients with\nrespect to sensitivity parameters. It is shown that the sensitivity at a given\nresponse threshold can be expressed via the expectation of response gradient\nconditional on the threshold. Determining the expectation requires conditioning\non the threshold that is a zero-probability event, but it can be resolved by\nthe concept of kernel smoothing. The proposed method offers sensitivity\nestimates for all response thresholds generated in a single Monte Carlo run.

Using\nthis pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \\$4000 and fine-tune\nonly the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\\% parameters) with 1,500\nsamples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently\nimproves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,\nQwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aGUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d4b\u4e88\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u98de\u8f6e\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9eGUI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u8fc7\u53bb\u8f68\u8ff9\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e14\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u4e3a\u5176\u8d4b\u4e88\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5185\u5b58\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u754c\u9762\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u7528VLM\u5c06GUI\u8f68\u8ff9\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u98de\u8f6e\u6536\u96c6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5185\u5b58\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6536\u96c6100k+\u8f68\u8ff9\u82b1\u8d39\u7ea64000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eGUI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0cQwen - 2.5 - VL - 7B +\u8fde\u7eed\u5185\u5b58\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u8fde\u7eed\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u98de\u8f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3aGUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This study, therefore,\nproposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating\npsychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing\nconsciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial\nconsciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based\non the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters\nwith different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several\nattributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and\nthe final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier\nclassification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated\nconsciousness, although the difference in response between different characters\nand consciousnesses was not very significant.

There are two main problems in the\ntask of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,\nexisting methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in\ncomplex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise\nrelationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in\nthe network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise\nrelationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy\nand data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification\nmethod for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to\naddress the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with\npairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the\nhigher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the\naccuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction\nmodule for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced\nto transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic\nevolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the\nphysical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure\nthat the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive\ndynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the\nprediction.

However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two\ncritical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific\nfeatures, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the\noutput, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs\nsyntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend\nstructured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code\ngeneration fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code\nbased on function-level syntactic dependencies.

This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more\ncapable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for\nautonomous and intelligent behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u96c6\u6210\u5404\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6253\u9020\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u201c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5316\u201d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u8ff0\u5404\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6253\u9020\u51fa\u80fd\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss\nclosely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised\nContrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this\nloss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\\em Do CL and NSCL also remain\naligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their\nobjectives?}\n  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL\nmodels trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and\naugmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain\nsimilar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL\nstay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability\nguarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and\nrepresentational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment\nimproves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch\nsize. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently\nunstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with\ntraining time.\n  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL\nalignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more\nclosely than other supervised objectives.

However, current SAE\ntraining methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are\nabsorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to\nconsistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive\nTemporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts\nfeature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and\nreconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over\ntime. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical\nthresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature\nselection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we\ndemonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to\nexisting methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent\nreconstruction quality.

Previous work\n(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the\ndecision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper\nand lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this\ngap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that\nscales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their\noptimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and\nit remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.\n  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives\nexploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than\noptimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the\nremoval of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without\nexplicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic\ntransitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret\nbounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition\nstructures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al.

For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we\nredesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from\n$T^{2/3}$ to $\\sqrt{T}$.

However, its vulnerability to\nadversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.\nAlthough existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from\nthree key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial\nattacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)\nthey have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but\ninstead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can\nintroduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack\nof robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent\nGeneral-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel\nrobust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted\nadversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is\ndesigned to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to\nexecute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks.

Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic\nfeatures such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our\nframework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war\nveteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives\nuncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over\nmental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and\npsychological states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d9\u4e8b\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u68a6\u5883\u53d9\u4e8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d9\u4e8b\u98ce\u683c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d9\u4e8b\u98ce\u683c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\uff0c\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u68a6\u5883\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u8a00\u8bed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5fc3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go\nbeyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that\nMPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal\nprompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236MLLMs\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u53caMPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325MLLMs\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\u5019\u9009\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMPO\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0MLLMs\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

This paper addresses\nthis gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,\nexplainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a\ntwo-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a\nreal-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model\nrepresents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events\n(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including\nplatform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the\nmodel is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting\nprotocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can\ncompound.

We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted\nmodel that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the\nuntrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for\nthis information autonomously.

Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models\nprivate sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is\nrepresented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally\noptimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it\nconsistently outperforms global minimax samplers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ece\u7eafLDP\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u529f\u80fdLDP\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u80fdLDP\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u7531\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u542b\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

To protect in danger patients from additional kidney\ndamage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are\ncrucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning\nmodels can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an\nenormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector\nnowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction\ncapability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive\ncomputer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is\nattained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing\nvalues; those are filled in using \"mean-mode\" and \"Random sampling method\"\nstrategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques\n(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision\nTree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance\nevaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the\ntechniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy.

Existing\nmodels typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time\nsteps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,\nand limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a\nlightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization\nthat adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into\ncompact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points\nacross multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence\ncriterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or\ngenerative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence\ncompression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a\nmodel-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised\ntime series encoders without retraining.

Cellular subpopulations may shift from\ncycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental\nfates.

To address this challenge, we propose MODE\n(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural\ngating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable\ncomponents, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and\naccurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because\nagents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is\nespecially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions.

Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks\nwhich simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology.

This trend has heightened the need for reliable\ndetection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated\ncontent. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers\nlargely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often\nleading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we\nargue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the\ndetection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In\nreality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their\ndiversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes\nprevious classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn\nthe essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen\nhuman-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the\ndetection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating\nhuman-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts\nare in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework\nusing one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based\nlearning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and\ngeneralizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the\nOOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake\ndataset.

These challenges include\nthe scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety\nconcerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating\nlarge volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality\nand cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation\nand training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a\nmultilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique\napproach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset\n(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using\nunique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,\nthis dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,\nbilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This\ntechnique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct\nmodel for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon\nthe pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks.

In the\nforward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level\nancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the\nreverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed\nsemantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic\nscale prediction process for language modeling.

Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major\nlineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165\nneutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes\nrepresented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances.

By conditioning the\ngenerative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and\nvertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication\nmetadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These\nheterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,\nenabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis\ndemonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low\nWasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under\nmatching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,\nexemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model\naccuracy on columnar cells.

As\ninteractions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the\ninterpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes\nincreasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful\nhuman-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations\nof the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge\nin deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of\ninterpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,\ni.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD\nsystems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable\nDriving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric\nvideo dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as\ncausal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived\nfrom both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we\npropose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates\nspatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc\ntechniques.

To address this, we conduct the first systematic study\nof data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.\nOur method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output\nentropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse\nmodes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the\nmodel's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy\nreduction.

During the generative process,\nnew samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional\ndistribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly\neffective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions.\nThis makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring\naccurate sample generation.\n  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The\nupdate step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update\ndepends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter\nspace in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based\noptimization and MCMC sampling.

Unfortunately, it is\noften computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size.

First, we\nshow that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered\nenvironments in a few tens of milliseconds.

Moreover, our approach also\ngenerates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing\nbaselines based on diffusion models.

However,\ndistribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can\nstill cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early\nfailure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots\nin human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure\nprediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via\nconformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures\nfrom benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier\nthan existing methods.

As these\nLLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such\npolicies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly\ncomplex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large\nfixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that\ngovern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.\nPrior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and\ndemonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on\ntext-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),\na new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model\nparameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy\nduring inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build\ntwo datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using\ntasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first\ninjects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised\nfinetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement\nlearning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for\ngrounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,\ngeneralization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal\npolicy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and\ncomprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

We show that a compact\nglider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its\ncentre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and\nreinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow\nthe glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend\nsensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature\nof this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our\nresults explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$,\nthe glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its\norientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force,\nwhich allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high\nviscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its\ncentre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that\nresults in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller\nthan for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the\ninertial lift force at large Re$_p$.\n  *These authors contributed equally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7c98\u6027\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8d28\u5fc3\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u9897\u7c92\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u9020\u6ed1\u7fd4\u5668\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6c89\u964d\u65f6\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u4ee5\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff08DNS\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u9897\u7c92\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570Re$_p$\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5927Re$_p$\u65f6\uff0c\u6ed1\u7fd4\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u5fc3\u79fb\u52a8\u5feb\u901f\u7ffb\u6eda\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u6c34\u5e73\u60ef\u6027\u5347\u529b\uff1b\u5c0fRe$_p$\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8d28\u5fc3\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u503e\u659c\u59ff\u6001\u6c89\u964d\u4ea7\u751f\u5c0f\u6c34\u5e73\u7c98\u6027\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4e0eRe$_p$\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cRe$_p$\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u5668\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u79fb\u52a8\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002"}}

We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the\nVLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes\npredefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.\nSpecifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO\nthat incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.\nIn addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim\nVLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and\nsuccess to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to\nsuccessfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the\nphysical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on\nclean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that\nthe action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack\nperformance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect.

However, these algorithms often\nget executed on the highest-fidelity qubits and computers to achieve the best\nperformance, causing low system throughput. Recent efforts have shown that VQAs\ncan be run on low-fidelity qubits initially and high-fidelity qubits later on\nto still achieve good performance. We take this effort forward and show that\ncarefully varying the qubit fidelity map of the VQA over its execution using\nour technique, Nest, does not just (1) improve performance (i.e., help achieve\nclose to optimal results), but also (2) lead to faster convergence. We also use\nNest to co-locate multiple VQAs concurrently on the same computer, thus (3)\nincreasing the system throughput, and therefore, balancing and optimizing three\nconflicting metrics simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNest\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08VQAs\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VQAs\u4e3a\u8fbe\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNest\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728VQA\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ed4\u7ec6\u6539\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u591a\u4e2aVQAs\u3002", "conclusion": "Nest\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}
