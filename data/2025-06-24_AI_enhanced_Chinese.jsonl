Context is derived by aggregating and\ninferring from dynamic IoT data, making it highly volatile and posing\nchallenges in maintaining freshness and real-time accessibility. Caching is a\npotential solution, but traditional policies struggle with the transient nature\nof context in IoT (e.g., ensuring real-time access for frequent queries or\nhandling fast-changing data). To address this, we propose the Dynamic Context\nMonitoring Framework (DCMF) to enhance context caching in Context Management\nPlatforms (CMPs) by dynamically evaluating and managing context. DCMF comprises\ntwo core components: the Context Evaluation Engine (CEE) and the Context\nManagement Module (CMM). The CEE calculates the Probability of Access (PoA)\nusing parameters such as Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Context (QoC),\nCost of Context (CoC), timeliness, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs),\nassigning weights to assess access likelihood. Based on this, the CMM applies a\nhybrid Dempster-Shafer approach to manage Context Freshness (CF), updating\nbelief levels and confidence scores to determine whether to cache, evict, or\nrefresh context items. We implemented DCMF in a Context-as-a-Service (CoaaS)\nplatform and evaluated it using real-world smart city data, particularly\ntraffic and roadwork scenarios. Results show DCMF achieves a 12.5% higher cache\nhit rate and reduces cache expiry by up to 60% compared to the m-CAC technique,\nensuring timely delivery of relevant context and reduced latency.

[FOCS'21], where a principal delegates\nthe execution of a project to an agent, and the agent can choose any subset\nfrom a given set of costly actions. At the core of the model is a reward\nfunction - a monotone set function that maps each set of actions taken by the\nagent into an expected reward to the principal. To incentivize the agent, the\nprincipal offers a contract specifying the fraction of the reward to be paid,\nand the agent responds with their optimal action set. The goal is to compute\nthe contract that maximizes the principal's expected utility.\n  Previous work showed that when the reward function is gross substitutes (GS),\nthe optimal contract can be computed in polynomial time, but the problem is\nNP-hard for the broader class of Submodular functions. This raised the\nquestion: is GS the true boundary of tractability for the optimal contract\nproblem? We prove that tractability extends to the strictly broader class of\nUltra functions. Interestingly, GS constitutes precisely the intersection of\nUltra and Submodular functions, and our result reveals that it is Ultra - not\nSubmodular - that drives tractability, overturning the prevailing belief that\nthe submodularity component of GS is essential. We further extend tractability\nbeyond additive costs, handling costs that are additive plus symmetric. Our\nresults require new techniques, as prior approaches relied on the submodularity\nof GS.

The success of the No-U-Turn\nSampler (NUTS) largely stems from its clever local adaptation of the\nintegration time in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via a geometric U-turn condition.\nHowever, posterior distributions frequently exhibit multi-scale geometries with\nextreme variations in scale, making it necessary to also adapt the leapfrog\nintegrator's step size locally and dynamically.

To address this issue, we introduce the\nWithin-orbit Adaptive Leapfrog No-U-Turn Sampler (WALNUTS), a generalization of\nNUTS that adapts the leapfrog step size at fixed intervals of simulated time as\nthe orbit evolves. At each interval, the algorithm selects the largest step\nsize from a dyadic schedule that keeps the energy error below a user-specified\nthreshold.

Extreme negative returns, though rare, can cause significant financial\ndisruption, and accurate modelling of such events is essential for effective\nrisk management. Traditional Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD) models often\nignore market conditions; in contrast, our framework links the scale parameter\nto covariates using a log-linear function, allowing tail risk to respond\ndynamically to market volatility. We examine four prior choices for Bayesian\nregularisation of regression coefficients: Cauchy, Lasso (Laplace), Ridge\n(Gaussian), and Zellner's g-prior. Simulation results suggest that the Cauchy\nprior delivers the best trade-off between predictive accuracy and model\nsimplicity, achieving the lowest RMSE, AIC, and BIC values. Empirically, we\napply the model to large negative returns (exceeding 5%) in the Nifty 50 index.\nVolatility measures from the Nifty 50, S&P 500, and gold are used as covariates\nto capture both domestic and global risk drivers. Our findings show that tail\nrisk increases significantly with higher market volatility.

Here, we calculate these eigenvectors\nanalytically for a model where the output of an economy in an activity\nincreases with the probability the economy is endowed with the factors required\nby the activity. We show that the eigenvector known as the Economic Complexity\nIndex or ECI is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is\nendowed with a factor, and that in a multi-factor model, it is an estimate of\nthe average endowment across all factors. We then generalize this result to\nother production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with\nprices, wages, and consumption. We find that our main result does not depend on\nthe introduction of prices or wages, and that the derived wage function is\nconsistent with the convergence of economies with a similar level of\ncomplexity.

Our findings reveal that while LLMs\nexhibit proficiency in straightforward tasks, they often falter in complex,\nmulti step operations, frequently producing plausible yet incorrect outputs.\nThese results underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling\nspreadsheet tasks that require precise logical reasoning and highlight the need\nfor integrating symbolic reasoning capabilities into LLM architectures. To\nsupport this, we introduce FLARE (Formula Logic, Auditing, Reasoning and\nEvaluation) a new benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on real-world\nspreadsheet logic, auditing, and reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u51fa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6FLARE\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u57fa\u672c\u516c\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u5230\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e38\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u5374\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u51fa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6FLARE\u3002"}}

While prior studies have explored specific\ncontributors to hurricane-induced damage, few have developed a unified\nframework capable of integrating a broader range of influencing factors to\ncomprehensively assess the sources of economic loss. In this study, we propose\na comprehensive modeling framework that categorizes contributing factors into\nthree key components: (1) hurricane characteristics, (2) water-related\nenvironmental factors, and (3) socioeconomic factors of affected areas. By\nintegrating multi-source data and aggregating all variables at the finer\nspatial granularity of the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level, we employ\nmachine learning models to predict economic loss, using insurance claims as\nindicators of incurred damage. Beyond accurate loss prediction, our approach\nfacilitates a systematic assessment of the relative importance of each\ncomponent, providing practical guidance for disaster mitigation, risk\nassessment, and the development of adaptive urban strategies in coastal and\nstorm-exposed areas.

While\nextant work largely centers around proportional representation of the voters,\nwe shift our focus to the candidates while preserving proportionality.\nIntuitively, candidates supported by similar voter groups should receive\ncomparable representation. Since deterministic voting rules cannot achieve this\nideal, we develop randomized voting rules that satisfy ex-ante neutrality,\nmonotonicity, and continuity, while maintaining strong ex-post proportionality\nguarantees.\n  Continuity of the candidate selection probabilities proves to be the most\ndemanding of our ex-ante desiderata. We provide it via voting rules that are\nalgorithmically stable, a stronger notion of robustness which captures the\ncontinuity of the committee distribution under small changes. First, we\nintroduce Softmax-GJCR, a randomized variant of the Greedy Justified Candidate\nRule (GJCR) [Brill and Peters, 2023], which carefully leverages slack in GJCR\nto satisfy our ex-ante properties. This polynomial-time algorithm satisfies\nEJR+ ex post, assures ex-ante monotonicity and neutrality, and provides\n$O(k^3/n)$-stability (ignoring $\\log$ factors). Building on our techniques for\nSoftmax-GJCR, we further show that stronger stability guarantees can be\nattained by (i) allowing exponential running time, (ii) relaxing EJR+ to an\napproximate $\\alpha$-EJR+, and (iii) relaxing EJR+ to JR.\n  We finally demonstrate the utility of stable voting rules in other settings.\nIn online dynamic committee voting, we show that stable voting rules imply\ndynamic voting rules with low expected recourse, and illustrate this reduction\nfor Softmax-GJCR. Our voting rules also satisfy a stronger form of stability\nthat coincides with differential privacy, suggesting their applicability in\nprivacy-sensitive domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ece\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6279\u51c6\u7684\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u968f\u673a\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u56f4\u7ed5\u9009\u6c11\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ee3\u8868\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e8b\u524d\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u3001\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u4e8b\u540e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Softmax - GJCR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "Softmax - GJCR\u7b97\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3EJR+\u4e8b\u540e\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e8b\u524d\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b$O(k^3/n)$ - \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u6001\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6295\u7968\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4f4e\u9884\u671f\u8ffd\u7d22\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Agents first determine their\nrespective partitions and collaboratively construct a spanning tree, electing a\nleader within $O(n \\log \\lambda)$ rounds using only $O(\\log \\lambda)$ bits per\nagent. A novel meeting mechanism between adjacent agents improves efficiency\nand eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the graph, requiring only the\nhighest agent ID $\\lambda$ among the $n$ agents. Notably, our techniques\nnaturally extend to general graphs, where leader election and spanning tree\nconstruction maintain the same round and memory complexities. Building on these\nfoundations, agents count butterflies per node in $O(\\Delta)$ rounds and\ncompute the total butterfly count of $G$ in $O(\\Delta+\\min\\{|A|,|B|\\})$ rounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Each\ncaptures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack\ncollaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions,\ntraditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate\nneeds. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains\nchallenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in\nreal user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in\ntimestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a\nthree-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles\nand community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)\nSemantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of\nflexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the\nplan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by\nexecutional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three\ndomains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K\nmulti-turn dialogs per dataset.

The standard approach to diffusion problems\nrequires the solution of the mathematical equations that describe both the\nconservation law and the constitutive relations, where the latter is\ntraditionally obtained after fitting experimental data to simplified material\nmodels. To exploit all available information and avoid bias in the material\nmodel, we follow a data-driven approach. While the conservation laws and\nboundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, the\nexperimental data is used directly in the numerical simulations, avoiding the\nneed of fitting material model parameters. In order to satisfy the conservation\nlaw a priori in the strong sense, we introduce a mixed finite element\nformulation. This relaxes the regularity requirements on approximation spaces\nwhile enforcing continuity of the normal flux component across all of the inner\nboundaries.

Traditional\nnormalizing flow methods require reversible architectures, which can limit\ntheir expressiveness and efficiency. Although diffusion models offer greater\nflexibility, they often suffer from high computational costs during inference.\nTo combine the strengths of both approaches, we introduce a two-stage method.\nFirst, we construct a training-free conditional diffusion model by analytically\nderiving an exact score function under a Gaussian mixture prior formed from\nsamples of the underlying joint distribution.

However, its mesh-based nature\ngives rise to substantial computational costs, especially for complex\nmultiscale simulations. Emerging machine learning-based methods (e.g., neural\noperators) provide data-driven solutions to PDEs, yet they present challenges,\nincluding high training cost and low model reusability. Here, we propose the\nneural-operator element method (NOEM) by synergistically combining FEM with\noperator learning to address these challenges. NOEM leverages neural operators\n(NOs) to simulate subdomains where a large number of finite elements would be\nrequired if FEM was used. In each subdomain, an NO is used to build a single\nelement, namely a neural-operator element (NOE).

Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Infrastructures, represented by Deep Learning\n(DL) frameworks, have served as fundamental DL systems over the last decade.\nHowever, the bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in\nsome critical scenarios (e.g., healthcare and autonomous driving). A simple yet\neffective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing).\nUnfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered\nmultiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a\ncoarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to\nwhether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language\nModels (LLMs) into fuzzing. However, current LLM-based fuzzing techniques only\nfocus on using LLMs to generate test cases while overlooking their potential to\nanalyze feedback information, failing to create more valid and diverse test\ncases. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to break the seal of Feedback-driven\nfuzzing for DL frameworks. The backbone of FUEL comprises two LLM-based agents,\nnamely analysis LLM and generation LLM. Analysis LLM agent infers analysis\nsummaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM agent creates\ntests guided by these analysis summaries. So far, FUEL has detected 104 bugs\nfor PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 47 already fixed,\nand 5 assigned with CVE IDs.

Research efforts have been dedicated\nto improving different aspects of FL, such as algorithm improvement, resource\nallocation, and client selection, to enable its deployment in distributed edge\nnetworks for practical applications. One of the reasons for the poor FL model\nperformance is due to the worker dropout during training as the FL server may\nbe located far away from the FL workers. To address this issue, an Hierarchical\nFederated Learning (HFL) framework has been introduced, incorporating an\nadditional layer of edge servers to relay communication between the FL server\nand workers. While the HFL framework improves the communication between the FL\nserver and workers, large number of communication rounds may still be required\nfor model convergence, particularly when FL workers have non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data. Moreover, the FL workers are assumed to\nfully cooperate in the FL training process, which may not always be true in\npractical situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nsynthetic-data-empowered HFL framework that mitigates the statistical issues\narising from non-IID local datasets while also incentivizing FL worker\nparticipation. In our proposed framework, the edge servers reward the FL\nworkers in their clusters for facilitating the FL training process. To improve\nthe performance of the FL model given the non-IID local datasets of the FL\nworkers, the edge servers generate and distribute synthetic datasets to FL\nworkers within their clusters.

To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal\nbenchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level\nphysics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8\nmajor sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The\nbenchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,\nsystematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative\nmodel-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous\nmulti-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,\nautomated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading\nsystem with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current\nstate-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.\nFor example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\\% accuracy in the proposed\nPhysUniBench.

While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show\npromising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.\nFine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current\nfine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to\nreproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability.

To\nsupport the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior\nrobustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax\nlearning paradigm.

Blockchains are distributed\nsystems that order and timestamp records of a given network of users, in a\npublic, cryptographically secure, and consensual way. The records, which may in\nkind be events, transaction orders, sets of rules for structured transactions\netc. are placed within well-defined datastructures called blocks, and they are\nlinked to each other by the virtue of cryptographic pointers, in a total\nordering which represents their temporal relations of succession. The ability\nto operate on the blockchain, and/or to contribute a record to the content of a\nblock are shared resources of the blockchain systems. In commercial networks,\nthese resources are exchanged in return for fiat money, and consequently,\nfairness is not a relevant problem in terms of computer engineering. In\nnon-commercial networks, however, monetary solutions are not available, by\ndefinition. The present non-commercial blockchain networks employ trivial\ndistribution mechanisms called faucets, which offer fixed amounts of free\ntokens (called cryptocurrencies) specific to the given network. This mechanism,\nalthough simple and efficient, is prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks and\ncannot address the fairness problem.

However, most proposed systems fail to properly handle uncertain or\nincorrect inputs and outputs.

We\nintroduce BouncerBench, a benchmark that evaluates whether LLM-based software\nagents can refuse to act when inputs are ill-defined or refuse to respond when\ntheir own outputs are likely to be incorrect. Unlike prior benchmarks that\nimplicitly incentivize models to generate responses even when uncertain,\nBouncerBench aims to improve precision by targeting two overlooked failure\npoints: (1) vague or underspecified issue descriptions in tickets and (2)\nlogically or functionally incorrect code patches created by the system. It\nmeasures whether proposed systems can distinguish actionable issues from vague\ntickets and valid patches from untrustworthy ones. We also implement a basic\ninput and output bouncer, evaluating how well current LLMs can abstain when\nneeded.

Hence, we conclude that there is significant room\nfor improvement before LLMs can be trusted to make correct decisions and\nrecommendations in real-world software engineering workflows.

Glaucoma experts classified the subjects\ninto four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:\n(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full\nsuperior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).\nAutomatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to\ncompute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.\nBiomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning\nmodel. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal\nstep, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For\neach task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area\nunder the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques\nwere employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each\nclassification.\n  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain\nimproved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and\ninferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,\ncontributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive\nexpansion with increasing disease severity.\n  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF\nloss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical\nregion contributing to model predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u76d8\uff08ONH\uff09\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u9752\u5149\u773c\u4e09\u79cd\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u89c6\u91ce\u7f3a\u635f\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6539\u5584\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6a21\u578bAUC\u9ad8\uff0cONH\u5e94\u53d8\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8fb9\u7f18\u662f\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30ONH\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u9752\u5149\u773c\u4e09\u79cd\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u89c6\u91ce\u7f3a\u635f\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u786e\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u654f\u611fONH\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u62db\u52df237\u540d\u9752\u5149\u773c\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\uff0c\u5bf9\u5355\u773cONH\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u773c\u538b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u773c\u538b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u7b5b\u677f\u5e94\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u8f93\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u9879\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528AUC\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7a81\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578bAUC\u4e3a0.77 - 0.88\uff0cONH\u5e94\u53d8\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u89c6\u91ce\u635f\u5931\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0b\u548c\u4e0b\u989e\u7f18\u662f\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u53d8\u654f\u611f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u968f\u75be\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6269\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "ONH\u5e94\u53d8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9752\u5149\u773c\u89c6\u91ce\u635f\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8fb9\u7f18\u800c\u975e\u7b5b\u677f\u662f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

Understanding SGD's generalization\nproperties is crucial for ensuring robust model performance on unseen data. In\nthis paper, we analyze the generalization error bounds of SGD for non-convex\nlearning by introducing the Type II perturbed SGD (T2pm-SGD), which\naccommodates both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions. The generalization\nerror bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the\nflatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$,\nsignificantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses,\nwhere n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting\nan optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further\nrefined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory\nterm is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across\niterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which\nincrease with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter\ngeneralization error bounds for both loss function types.

In particular,\nreachability analysis is increasingly used in Open-Source Software (OSS)\nprojects to identify reachable vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) through call\ngraphs, enabling a focus on exploitable risks. Performing reachability analysis\ntypically requires the vulnerable function (VF) to track the call chains from\ndownstream applications. However, such crucial information is usually\nunavailable in modern vulnerability databases like NVD. While directly\nextracting VF from modified functions in vulnerability patches is intuitive,\npatches are not always available. Moreover, our preliminary study shows that\nover 26% of VF do not exist in the modified functions. Meanwhile, simply\nignoring patches to search vulnerable functions suffers from overwhelming\nnoises and lexical gaps between descriptions and source code.

However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,\nexisting call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound\nnor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges\nand miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed\ncall edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full\nprogram graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our\napproach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model\nnon-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose\nrepresenting JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and\nsemantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static\ncall edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the\nsame or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine\nlearning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by\nranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a\nlarge-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges\n(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M\nstructural and 386K semantic edges.

However, existing dynamic/mixed precision\nquantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training\nquantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The\nstate-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes\nit challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying\nmultiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and\nswitching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly\npost-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device\nquantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates\nthe integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into\nhigher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a\ndecomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by\nadaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In\ndeployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between\nthe full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to\nresource changes and reduce consumption.

In order to solve this problem, this\npaper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework\nbased on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This\nmethod is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,\nand integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the\ncontext understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault\nchains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised\nclustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and\nsemantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round\nattention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to\ngenerate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this\npaper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,\nwhich is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic\ndecision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with\nthe existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model\nhas stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and\nheterogeneous environment adaptability.

Existing LLM Uncertainty\nQuantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn\nquestion-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,\ne.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential\ndecision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the\ncurrent decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic\nuncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty\nshould be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an\nefficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the\ndirect estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)\nover multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is\nevaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,\nAgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly\noutperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful\naggregation strategies.

Creating a single platform for\nstandardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of\nbalancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of\nvarious disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully\nenable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly\nmultidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge\nwith sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains.

Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable\nlimitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision\nmaking rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to\nlearn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks.

The resulting\ncomprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its\nrefinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within\nthis iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a\nrobust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.\nExtensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1\nimprovements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProperty - Generated Solver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfTDD\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u8f93\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfTDD\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u800c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Property - Generated Solver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5668\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cProperty - Generated Solver\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfTDD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cpass@1\u670923.1%\u81f337.3%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u95ed\u73af\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f15\u64ce\uff0cProperty - Generated Solver\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}

Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities\nby generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen\nfeatures. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,\nsolely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior\nknowledge.

This paper presents\nmedicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and\nregulatory decisions.

The KG tackles the absence of a unified national\ndrug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its\ndesign was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure\nreal-world applicability.

However, for challenging\ncorpora, we argue that enhancing queries alone is insufficient for robust\nsemantic matching; the LLM should also have sufficient understanding of the\ncorpus by directly handling and augmenting the documents themselves. To this\nend, we present an LLM-based retriever empowered to augment both user queries\nand corpus documents, with its policy fully explored via reinforcement learning\n(RL) and minimal human inductive bias. Notably, we find that simply allowing\nthe LLM to modify documents yields little benefit unless paired with our\ncarefully designed bidirectional RL framework, which enables the LLM to\nsimultaneously learn and collaborate on both query and document augmentation\npolicies. A key technical challenge in realizing such a framework lies in\njointly updating both policies during training, where the rewards for the two\ndirections depend on each other, making their entangled reward intractable.

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer.

This diverse content consumption pattern\nintroduces unique challenges for computational advertising, which must\neffectively integrate a variety of ad modalities, including audio, video, and\ndisplay, within a single user experience. Traditional ad recommendation models,\nprimarily designed for foregrounded experiences, often struggle to reconcile\nthe platform's inherent audio-centrality with the demands of optimizing ad\nperformance across multiple formats and modalities. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce Cross-modal Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (CAMoE), a\nnovel framework for optimizing click-through rate (CTR) prediction in both\naudio-centric and multi-modal settings. CAMoE enhances traditional\nmixture-of-experts models by incorporating modality-aware task grouping,\nadaptive loss masking, and deep-cross networks (DCN) to capture complex feature\ninteractions within a multi-modal ad ecosystem. Through extensive ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate that this approach achieves near Pareto-optimal\nperformance across audio, video, and display ad formats, significantly\nimproving AUC-PR compared to conventional single-task and content-based\nmulti-task learning baselines.

Manual extraction is slow and\nlabor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,\nengineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable\noutputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework\n(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),\nwhich delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a\nlow-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.\nSpecifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication\n(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish\nconsensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.\nMeanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal\npolicy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level\ncontrol. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity\nsoftware-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a\nsuperior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task\ncompletion capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u8ffd\u9003\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u8eb2\u907f\u4e0e\u7f16\u961f\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6CI - HRL\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u8ffd\u9003\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8eb2\u907f\u4e0e\u7f16\u961f\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6CI - HRL\uff0c\u9ad8\u5c42\u7528ConsMAC\u6a21\u5757\u611f\u77e5\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7528AT - M\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCI - HRL\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7fa4\u96c6\u534f\u540c\u8eb2\u907f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CI - HRL\u4e3a\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u8ffd\u9003\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8eb2\u907f\u4e0e\u7f16\u961f\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we\nespecially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be\nunderstood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear\napproximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the\nparametric space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u5f15\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u9002\u5f53\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c11\u8ba8\u8bba\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u95f4\u63a5\u5f15\u51fa\u5c5e\u6027\u65f6\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u518d\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u5c40\u90e8\u6620\u5c04\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u968f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6743\u91cd\u589e\u52a0\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6743\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u5e38\u662f\u67d0\u4e9b\u6743\u91cd\u8bbe\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u4e8c\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u7406\u8bba\u5b8c\u7f8e\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

However, these labeled\nsupport samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity\ncomparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space\nitself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a\nseries of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning\nmethods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning\n(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and\nAugmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT).

We frame\nthe problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of\nseveral adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail\nbooking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,\nnearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate\nindividual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to\nmedication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of\nlongitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny\nCounty in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence\nadvances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies\nconfirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their\nremoval amplifies the estimated effects.

Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main\nissues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality\nexplanations for preference learning.

Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)\nand supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of\nstate changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct\ndetection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO\nbased on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major\nvulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise\nlabels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and\nlow-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we\nperform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding\nof specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT\nwith our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human\nfeedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability\nof preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred\noutputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types:\nreentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall,\nas well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities.

Specifically, a dual representation incomplete\nmulti-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information\nbetween views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing\nview imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order\nsimilarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning\nbetween these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the\nlearned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the\nTSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning\nmechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,\nand Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC\ndataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained\nthe best results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u624b\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728MVRC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u518d\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c06\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u56fe\u63d2\u8865\u878d\u5165\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d2\u8865\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cc\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26TSK\u6a21\u7cca\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u624b\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u56fe\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVRC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cDRIMV_TSK\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u624b\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

The NBP prior is an\nadaptive generalization of the horseshoe prior with tunable hyperparameters\nthat control tail behavior, enabling a flexible range of sparsity, from strong\nshrinkage to ridge-like regularization. Unlike prior work that introduced the\ngroup inverse-gamma gamma (GIGG) prior by decomposing the NBP prior into\nstructured hierarchies, we show that directly controlling the tails is\nsufficient without requiring complex hierarchical constructions. Extending the\nnon-tail adaptive grouped half-Cauchy hierarchy of Xu et al., GRASP assigns the\nNBP prior to both local and group shrinkage parameters allowing adaptive\nsparsity within and across groups.

We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits.

Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the\npredicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper\nconfidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of\nepisodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over\ntime (rate upper bounded by $\\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our\nproposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain\nknowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning\nprocess. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior\nperformance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in\nnon-stationary environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5206\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\uff08RMABs\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u7d2f\u79ef\u9057\u61be\u4f4e\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "RMABs\u6700\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97Whittle\u6307\u6570\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\u672a\u77e5\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u9884\u6d4b\u5f53\u524d\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\uff0c\u518d\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173Whittle\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u4e0a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u9057\u61be\u4f4e\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u975e\u5e73\u7a33RMABs\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Machine\nlearning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.\nHowever, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose\nlevels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.\nAdditionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be\nexplainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine\nlearning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated\nagainst established medical literature, reducing confidence in their\nreliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that\npredict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and\nlifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.\nImportantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential\nmodel features and validate them against established medical literature.

Although deep learning-based methods have\nachieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in\nlong-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates\nthat large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series\nforecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have\nshortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt\nformulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual\nprompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based\ntime series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and\ncross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified\ntextual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard\nprompts.

By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these\ngroups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group\nconsistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.\nSimultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral\nstrategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.\nCrucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad\napplicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in\nvarious grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly\nenhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task\nspecialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides\nnew ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,\nand its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic\nenvironments can be further explored in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDLBC\u65b9\u6cd5\u8c03\u8282\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u5185\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u5f80\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7ec4\u5185\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u7ec4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Dual - Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7ec4\u5185\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7ea6\u675f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5206\u7ec4\u5408\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDLBC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5185\u5408\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DLBC\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions.

While prior work has improved the timeliness and\naccuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into\nactionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the\ndecoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can\nsignificantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency\nresponse, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not\njust incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive\nSpatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting\nparadigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework\nensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby\nmaximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new\nResource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively\ncaptures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,\nproducing context-aware spatiotemporal representations.

When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in\nreal-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous\ntemporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful\napplications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus\non preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order\ngroup interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world\nnetworks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static\nhomogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in\nHTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order\ninteraction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of\nheterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge\nconstruction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a\nnovel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to\nfully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs.

These methods\ndepart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as\nApriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating\nprior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic\ninference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to\nmodel item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled\ninference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen\nitemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and\noptional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification\nthrough full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,\nincluding its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the\nitemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a\ngeneralizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these\napproaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for\ndiscovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical\nresults on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,\nwhile also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and\ninterpretability.

As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,\nparticularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80\npercent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on\nnon-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable\ndevices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the\nlimitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or\nmmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.\nThese limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,\nincluding system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading\nin WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based\nmethods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving\nMultimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.\nFirst, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse\nmillimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and\npreprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real\nbathroom settings, which will be released upon publication.

However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and\nLiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a\nrange of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task\norchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is\nexpected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,\nand resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and\nheterogeneous data streams.

We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during\npretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and\nperform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training\nmixture.

This primary\nlimitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which\nresults in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the\nchallenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of\ngenerating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of\nthe reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct\nanswer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free\nframework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the\nLLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal\nand maximizes the expected reward during training.

However, DAG learning remains highly\nchallenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and\nidentifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these\ntwo challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear\ntransformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple\norder-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG\n(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple\nlinear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed\ndata to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based\nkernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.\nBy formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous\noptimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural\nproperties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the\nill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes.

However, prior work has focused on\nsolely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image\nportions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium\nto communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that\nleverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.\nImage Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their\nbias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three\nsteps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and\nthe image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by\ncomparing the bias scores.

To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression\nframework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient\nvariants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches.

These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models.

Large amounts of chemical and process data are\nproprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,\nhindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.\nRecently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in\nML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models\nwithout disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications\nof federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the\nmolecular to the process scale.

To\naccomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and\ndensity function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly\nsimplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables\nsimulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from\ndata-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal\ntransport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,\nwith straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of\naccessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of\napplication domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal\ndynamics from population data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u798f\u514b - \u666e\u6717\u514b\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u8981\u6c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we\npropose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation\n(MAGTKD) for the ERC task.

Our approach\nenhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking\nprocess in question-answering (Q\\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases\n(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for\nhandling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.\nContinuing the \\textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology\nroute of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently\nsolvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through\n\\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent\nforms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either\nKnowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and\nvariables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the\nsolving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval\ntasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning\nanalysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval\nsub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as\nequivalent KBs.

It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(n^2)$ queries,\nwhile adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known\nalgorithm uses $k-1$ rounds.

We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training\nsuch VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic\ndataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through\nextensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing\nVLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%\nabsolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution\ntasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that\nfine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase\ncompared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRoboMonkey\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709VLA\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Vision - Language - Action (VLA) \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u6570\u5e42\u5f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRoboMonkey\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u6848\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528VLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u9009\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709VLAs\u4e0eRoboMonkey\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad825%\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u9ad88%\uff1b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03VLAs\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6bd4\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03VLAs\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad87%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fRoboMonkey\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347VLAs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0BF\u968f\u751f\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eBF\uff0cBF\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u60c5\u51b5\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55nudging\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "1.

While context-based memory models can explain many\nmemory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over\npossible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that\nfoundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically,\nrecurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention\n-- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the\nContext Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural\nmachine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their\nconvergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the\nfunctional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to\nmodel human memory.

The\ndiscrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions\ndegrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied\nto others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has\nbeen introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing\nmulti-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the\nextent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely\nstudied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact\non fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the\nmodel to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall\ngeneralization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing\nend-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically\nin variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a\nreal-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,\naiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant\noperating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with\na retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant\nfault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the\nsource domain.

While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,\nstudies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these\nupdates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random\nselection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL\nperformance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients.

Naturally, it is common to demonstrate\nthe advantages of these new controllers against established methods like\nanalytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the\nperformance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated\nthan might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of\nagile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop\na set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric\ncontrollers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread\nRL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the\ntask definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative\ndatasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,\ndescribing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the\nfollowing: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned\nand classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can\nyield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,\nbut we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than\npreviously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric\ncontrol achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better\ntransient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or\nless agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.\nFinally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for\nthese aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.\nWebsite and code is available at https://pratikkunapuli.github.io/rl-vs-gc/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u654f\u6377\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u504f\u5411RL\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6ca1\u90a3\u4e48\u5927\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u5982RL\uff09\u548c\u5206\u6790\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u5982GC\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u56fa\u5b9a\u81c2\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u654f\u6377\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u5408\u6210\u6700\u4f73RL\u548cGC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u58f0\u79f0RL\u4f18\u4e8eGC\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5dee\u8ddd\u6ca1\u90a3\u4e48\u5927\uff0cGC\u7a33\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\uff0cRL\u77ac\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0cGC\u5728\u6162\u6216\u4f4e\u654f\u6377\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0cRL\u5728\u9ad8\u654f\u6377\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}

Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,\nprompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim\nrepresentation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review\nexamines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and\npractitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review\nmethodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024\ninvestigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary\nprompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,\nself-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and\nparameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential\nfor reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias\ntypes. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to\nprompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines\ndemonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction\nin bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting\noffers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness.

To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately\nimplemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the\ncalibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the\nRandom Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a\ntraining AUC of 1.00 and a testing AUC of 0.96.

In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods\ndeliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;\nhowever, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the\nrepresentational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic\ninformation. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode\nrich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain\nunder-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with\nobject-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability.

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.

However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be\nchallenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.\nIn this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and\nbi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal\nfundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\narchitecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels\nacross vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I\nis used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin\nvessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus\nimage is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited\nAdaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase\nintensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and\nbackground pixels.

While\nwritten GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback\nbased on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,\ntranscription errors, and the lack of structured input.

Existing defenses have focused,\nimplicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to\nthe number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally\ninfeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the\nworst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose\ncomputational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial\npatches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble\nof binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the\nneural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It\nthen performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the\ninput to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,\nSpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial\nregions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We\nevaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and\nclassification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art\ndefenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection\nand the case of image classification, respectively.

We conducted two between-subject\nexperiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or\npracticed independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary\n(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference).

Despite large-scale success, there remain significant\nchallenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory\nresources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in\ntask-specific transfer learning.

To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch\nPooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch\nembeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve\nefficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module\nin our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism\nallowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space\ncomplexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch\nembeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively\nmodulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while\nmaintaining the global semantic structure.

However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic\nconstraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the\ncanonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants\nthat guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this\nfoundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),\nthe first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,\nrestoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems\ninto a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent\nencoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space\ndynamics end-to-end.

While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive\nevaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as\nDeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic\njailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and\nGPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack\nstrategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and\nsemantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness\nagainst optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly\nhigher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In\ncontrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety\nalignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design\nand reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral\nanalysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial\nprompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal\nbehaviors.

As a\nresult, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous\ngenerators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the\nmicrogrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual\nsynchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic\nbehaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,\nfixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency\nregulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic\nadjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable\nfrequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and\ndroop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This\ncontroller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual\nparameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by\nconsidering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study\nthe system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real\ntime using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,\nCortex-M3).

The unit cost of an LLM is\nthe computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in\nthe efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the\nnumber of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation\nis that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the\ntokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most\nlikely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that\nimmediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing\ntokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for\ndifferent tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot\nconversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in\nthis domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u8282\u77015% - 10%\u80fd\u6e90\u4e14\u5bf9\u539f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5927\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u589e\u591a\u800c\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u56de\u590d\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u8282\u77015% - 10%\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\uff0c\u5bf9\u539f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6548\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8282\u7701\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u539f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002"}}

Many existing methods rely on\nmotion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to\nensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.\nWe introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables\nrobust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo\ncamera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute\nlocalization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in\nthe target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight\nobject detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based\nfiltering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These\nmeasurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full\n6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive\ncontroller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.\nTo ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online\nfrom a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling\nreal-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate\nNOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest\ntrails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss\nand severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate.

Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2\nachieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including\ntext-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,\nalso referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named\nOmniContext.

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.
