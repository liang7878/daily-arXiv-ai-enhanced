By 2026, the Together\nfor Sustainability (TfS) consortium will require reporting of biogenic carbon\ncontent (BCC) in chemical products, posing a challenge as BCC depends on\nfeedstocks, value chain configuration, and process-specific variables. While\ncarbon-14 isotope analysis can measure BCC, it is impractical for continuous\nindustrial monitoring. This work presents CarAT (Carbon Atom Tracker), an\nautomated methodology for calculating BCC across industrial value chains,\nenabling dynamic and accurate sustainability reporting. The approach leverages\nexisting Enterprise Resource Planning data in three stages: (1) preparing value\nchain data, (2) performing atom mapping in chemical reactions using chemistry\nlanguage models, and (3) applying a linear program to calculate BCC given known\ninlet compositions. The methodology is validated on a 27-node industrial\ntoluene diisocyanate value chain. Three scenarios are analysed: a base case\nwith fossil feedstocks, a case incorporating a renewable feedstock, and a\nbutanediol value chain with a recycle stream. Results are visualised with\nSankey diagrams showing the flow of carbon attributes across the value chain.\nThe key contribution is a scalable, automated method for real-time BCC\ncalculation under changing industrial conditions.

Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses.

This flexibility leads to components that are\nstronger, lighter, and more cost-effective than traditional monolithic\ncounterparts. The fabrication of CGAs have become increasingly feasible owing\nto recent advancements in additive manufacturing (AM), particularly in\nmulti-material printing and improved precision in material deposition. However,\nAM of CGAs requires imposition of manufacturing constraints; in particular\nlimits on the maximum spatial gradation of composition.\n  This paper introduces a topology optimization (TO) based framework for\ndesigning optimized CGA components with controlled compositional gradation. In\nparticular, we represent the constrained composition distribution using a\nband-limited coordinate neural network.

These capabilities already\nsupport tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the\ndiscovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy\nan essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same\ntime, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal\nstructure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.\nRecognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial\nfor scientific rigor.

The search time is normalized by the target's\ndistance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive\nanalysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all\ntarget locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result\nfor a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about\n$\\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents.\nWe give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a\nlogarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost\nindependent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper\nbound $\\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our\nmain contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time\nfor $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset\nof agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular\noffsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the\ntarget. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can\nbeat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean\nof their speeds exceeds $\\mathcal{U}_n / \\mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents\nmay be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral\nalgorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic\ncomplements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design\nhybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based\nalgorithms when some agents are slow.

Coordinating development\nbetween GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,\ninconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a\nmixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit\nactivities are coordinated.

Experiments on time series models typically focus on\ndemonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline\nsolutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that\nforecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners\noften value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.\nAssuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary\ndrastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human\nintervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose\ntrust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and\naccuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,\nTemporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on\npublic data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show\nthat ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or\neven improving) forecast accuracy.

A key\ndesign choice in these models is how to represent items, traditionally through\nunique identifiers (IDs) and more recently with Semantic IDs composed of\ndiscrete codes, obtained from embeddings. While task-specific embedding models\ncan improve performance for individual tasks, they may not generalize well in a\njoint setting. In this paper, we explore how to construct Semantic IDs that\nperform well both in search and recommendation when using a unified model.

However, these continual changes introduce significant\nchallenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and\nmaintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the\nchallenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined\ncontracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%\nof compilation errors.\n  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version\nmigrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)\nand closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these\nmodels exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes\nsignificantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt\nengineering strategies.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language.

In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages.

Simulations and experiments\ndemonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under\nfull-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming\ntraditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for\ncomplex inverse scattering problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6e90\u53cd\u6f14\u6846\u67b6DeepCSI\u7528\u4e8e\u4ecb\u8d28\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6d4b\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6d4b\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4ecb\u8d28\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6e90\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u4ecb\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeepCSI\u5728\u5168\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65e0\u76f8\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCSI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepCSI\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent studies have introduced\nvarious alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage\nframework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable\ninformation loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive\nalignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information\nmaximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method\nthat simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic\nintegrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically\nassociated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient\nalignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the\nfollowing two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative\nAlignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and\ncollaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and\nthen design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item\n(u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence\nitem-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual\nquantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads\nachieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments\nand online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully\ndeployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400\nmillion users daily.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u53cc\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff08DAS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49ID\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u5e76\u5df2\u5728\u5feb\u624b\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49ID\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u8350\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u9636\u6bb5DAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53cc\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DAS\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5feb\u624b\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5e7f\u544a\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u8d854\u4ebf\u65e5\u6d3b\u7528\u6237\u3002", "conclusion": "DAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49ID\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Additionally, we observed that\nrelative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as\nattention maps.

FL offers formal security guarantees when\ncombined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,\nhowever, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical\nutility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often\npresent in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these\ninterconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL\nframework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial\nexperiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,\nresulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first\nintegrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek\nLinks (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically\nuseful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using\na tuned FedProx algorithm.

The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability.

Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,\nsuffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter\ntuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an\nempirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This\ndesign is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two\nintuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and\nAmazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that\nCrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,\nreward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,\nhigh-performance language model adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReward - Guided Test - Time Compute (RTTC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9TTC\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Query - State Caching\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTC\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RTTC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u6548TTC\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e94\u7528RAG\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u51faQuery - State Caching\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRTTC\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901aRAG\u6216TTT\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684TTC\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548cRTTC\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep\nsemantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the\nefficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into\ndialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional\napproaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,\nwhich often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in\nrecommendations that may not align with user expectations.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender\ncentered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided\ncontext-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor.

Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize\nrecurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to\ncapture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline\ndecomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the\nproblem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component\ndecomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method\nfirst determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component\nsolely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm.

To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u75be\u75c5\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e2a\u4f53\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u501f\u52a9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u5f80\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedKEI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u4ee5\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u518d\u4f18\u5316\u7c07\u95f4\u548c\u7c07\u5185\u805a\u5408\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u3001\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u548c\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedKEI\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u75be\u75c5\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedKEI\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u75be\u75c5\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content.

Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are\nmore comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that\nmultimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76XAI\u5bf9\u89c6\u529b\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6b8b\u75be\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u8868\u660e\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1XAI\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u89c6\u529b\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76XAI\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4e00\u662f\u5bf979\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u3001\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9XAI\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7528\u6237\u6bd4\u8be6\u7ec6\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "XAI\u5bf9\u89c6\u529b\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002"}}

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While\nthis advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge\ndevices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for\ndeploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive\nend-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying\nMamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by\nreplacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware\nalternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation\nand exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,\nand MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves\ncomparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\\times$\nfewer parameters.

As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference.

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The\nmapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this\nprocess. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance\non both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.\nBeyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of\nreasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective\nstrategy for strengthening SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDURIT\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u4e14\u5608\u6742\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u628a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c4\u8303\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DURIT\u4e09\u6b65\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u5bf9\u9f50\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8bad\u7ec3\u6620\u5c04\u5668\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u3002", "result": "DURIT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0cDURIT\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where\ndecisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand\nnot only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to\nensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional\nfederated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize\nprimarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving\nCoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,\nexisting methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating\nknowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication\noverhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We\naddresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed\nto enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight\nchain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple\nreasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most\npromising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while\nproviding valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical\napplications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved\naggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating\nclient classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse\nclients.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that\nencodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a\nshared graph learning space.

By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them\nthrough a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and\nknowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and\ndistributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two\nMedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified\nlearning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and\ntested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large\ndistribution shifts.

Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the\nintroduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling\ntasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application\nscenario is improved by 13%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7c92\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08GATs\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e0e\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08GATs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u4efb\u4f55\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSE\uff09\u964d\u4f4e9%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad813%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u5229\u7528GATs\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which\nseverely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent\npersonalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,\nwe propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via\ndual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we\ndevelop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization\nand individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared\nprimary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated\nrefinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The\nanalytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains\nidentical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all\nother clients.

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally\nrich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties\ntrust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they\nare used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this\npaper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification\nparadigm for data attribution.

Our workshop aims to tackle these challenges and prepare researchers\nwith practical strategies for longitudinal studies.

As they\nevolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they\nreproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining\nhegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on\nquantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which\nbiases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility.

A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy\nconsumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack\ntypes, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and\nsigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A\nsynthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household\nbehaviour.

These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous\nobject boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,\nsuch mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data\naugmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and\nits label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's\ngeneralization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel\naugmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to\naddress such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing\ncontrolled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving\nthe original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust\nrepresentations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves\nperformance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in\naverage on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even\nwithout bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit\nlabel noise.

Here we challenge this view by\nestablishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally\ndifferent computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal\ndynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In\ncontrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the\nrepresentational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their\nartificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including\nclassification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.\n  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment\nbetween input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,\noffers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in\nneuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration\ndynamic.

To overcome the\nscarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on\nthe domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible\ntextbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into\na textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog\ncircuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,\nunlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,\nwhere a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in\nunstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning\nprocesses, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To\naddress the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,\nwe explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and\nexperimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training\nparadigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained\nsupervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by\nconstraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output\ndistributions before and after training. In practice, we train the\nQwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%\naccuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,\nwith a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with\nmainstream commercial models.

Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement\nwith reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest\ndiscrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.\n  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient\nmethod for automated cloud classification from infrared radiances, suitable for\noperational retrievals and future missions such as Far infrared Outgoing\nRadiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), the ninth European Space Agency\nEarth Explorer Mission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6c14\u8c61\u536b\u661f\u7ea2\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e91\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e1a\u52a1\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u672a\u6765\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5927\u6c14\u53cd\u6f14\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e91\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CISVM\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u4e91\u654f\u611f\u7684\u901a\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe88.30%\uff0c\u4e0eMODIS\u4e91\u63a9\u819c\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6781\u5730\u5730\u533a\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5dee\u5f02\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "CISVM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4e91\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e1a\u52a1\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u672a\u6765\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Given the LLM's diminished reasoning\nover extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches\nremain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

While prior work\nhas acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it\nto data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

Existing practices mix all data sensor types\nin a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the\ndata-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint\ndistribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark\nwhere all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,\ncausing \\textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to\nperformance \\textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances\nin two aspects: \\ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is\nintroduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,\nreducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by\n27\\%. \\ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,\nprogressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation\ncan be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally\naligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further\nexploration of injecting CL into the unification process.

To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\ncross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four\ndiverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,\nand animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application\nscenarios.

Much research is\navailable on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high\ndimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a\nchallenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in\nattractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we\ncomprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield\nnetwork undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to\nformation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show\nthat, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce\na pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new\nattractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an\nabrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful\nlearning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point\nattractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With\nthis, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same\nmechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal\nand applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form.

Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically\nsuffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,\nfailing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against\nsophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a\nnovel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of\nhyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises\nover 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,\nstate-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,\nCogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary\narchitectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging\nsubsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal\nannotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and\nLow-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting\ndownstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization.

To\naddress this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)\nPerceptual Factors Framework.

Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to\nquantify the uncertainty for a given task.

To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases.
