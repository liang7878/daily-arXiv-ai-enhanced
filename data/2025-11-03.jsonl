Although finite-horizon dynamic models have long been proposed to\ncapture the strategic intertemporal incentives of oligopolists, the existence\nand form of equilibrium strategies in settings that allow for firm exit\n(drop-outs following loss-making periods) have remained an open question. We\nfocus on the seminal dynamic oligopoly model by Selten (1965) that introduces\nthe subgame perfect equilibrium and analyzes smooth market sharing. Equilibrium\ncan be derived analytically in models that do not allow for dropouts, but not\nin models that can lead to predatory pricing. In this paper, we leverage recent\nadvances in deep reinforcement learning to compute and verify equilibria in\nfinite-horizon dynamic oligopoly games. Our experiments reveal two key\nfindings: first, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms\nreliably converge to equilibrium in both perfect- and imperfect-information\noligopoly models; second, when firms face asymmetric cost structures, the\nresulting equilibria exhibit predatory pricing behavior. These results\ndemonstrate that predatory pricing can emerge as a rational equilibrium\nstrategy across a broad variety of model settings. By providing equilibrium\nanalysis of finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly models with drop-outs, our study\nanswers a decade-old question and offers new insights for competition\nauthorities and regulators."}

However, this overlooks\nother neural parameters that can also be learned and may be utilized by the\nbrain. One such parameter is the delay: the brain exhibits complex temporal\ndynamics with heterogeneous delays, where signals are transmitted\nasynchronously between neurons. It has been theorized that this delay\nheterogeneity, rather than a cost to be minimized, can be exploited in embodied\ncontexts where task-relevant information naturally sits contextually in the\ntime domain. We test this hypothesis by training spiking neural networks to\nmodify not only their weights but also their delays at different levels of\nprecision. We find that delay heterogeneity enables state-of-the-art\nperformance on temporally complex neuromorphic problems and can be achieved\neven when weights are extremely imprecise (1.58-bit ternary precision: just\npositive, negative, or absent). By enabling high performance with extremely\nlow-precision weights, delay heterogeneity allows memory-efficient solutions\nthat maintain state-of-the-art accuracy even when weights are compressed over\nan order of magnitude more aggressively than typically studied weight-only\nnetworks. We show how delays and time-constants adaptively trade-off, and\nreveal through ablation that task performance depends on task-appropriate delay\ndistributions, with temporally-complex tasks requiring longer delays.

Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises\nfurther acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple\nmodels has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs\nspeculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference\nacceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation\nquantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade\nalgorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.\nWe introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the\nmulti-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics\nof acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves\nstate-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative\ndecoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\\times$ to $2.3\\times$ over\nautoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets.

Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for\nadapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing\nlatency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization\nusing machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key\nlimitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among\nparameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification\nprevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,\nlimiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,\nto reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often\nselects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that\ncontribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most\ncommon method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on\nsurrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient\nexploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel\nframework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and\nlearns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.\nRelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),\nwhich combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity\nto previously high-performing configurations.

The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets.

We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers.

Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on\nattribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious\ncorrelations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes\n(color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in\nour dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's\nrealistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform\nevaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further\nexplore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of\ntraffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus\non two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance\nbetween base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework\ncontribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign\nrecognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and\ndistribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in\ndeveloping more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving\nand cyber-physical systems."}

Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406\nsubjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had\napproximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three\nhuman experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and\nexcessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the\nvisual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce\nimages with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were\nneither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected.\nEvaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and\nqualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent\nMR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs\nthan the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs\ncompared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment,\nthe generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from\nreal data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer\nstatistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In\nconclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion\nmodel for brain data without skullstripping or registration.

Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems.

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}

In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and\ncomputed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,\nsmall and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired\nwith 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid\nrule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,\nwe propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,\nCT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges\nglobal contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing\nclinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human\nevaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report\ngeneration quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding."}

We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.
