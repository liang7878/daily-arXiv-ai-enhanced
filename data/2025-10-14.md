### [1] [The Geometry of Reasoning: Flowing Logics in Representation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09782)
*Yufa Zhou,Yixiao Wang,Xunjian Yin,Shuyan Zhou,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出几何框架研究大语言模型推理，理论结合实验验证框架有效性，为研究推理现象提供基础和工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何通过表示空间进行“思考”。

Method: 提出几何框架将大语言模型推理建模为流，通过相同命题不同语义载体分离逻辑结构和语义，利用学习的表示代理设计对照实验。

Result: 理论证明大语言模型推理对应表示空间中的平滑流，逻辑语句是流速度的局部控制器；实验为理论框架提供了实证验证。

Conclusion: 本文为研究推理现象提供概念基础和实用工具，为大语言模型行为的可解释性和形式分析提供新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

*Valerie Chen,Rohit Malhotra,Xingyao Wang,Juan Michelini,Xuhui Zhou,Aditya Bharat Soni,Hoang H. Tran,Calvin Smith,Ameet Talwalkar,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出PULSE框架用于以人类为中心评估智能体设计，在开源软件智能体平台收集数据，研究设计决策对开发者满意度影响，指出基准测试评估的局限性并为评估和设计提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设全自动化，未能体现现实场景中人类与智能体协作的特点，需要对人机交互进行严格评估。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，包括收集用户反馈、训练机器学习模型预测用户满意度、结合人类满意度评级和模型生成的伪标签计算结果；在围绕OpenHands构建的大规模网络平台收集超1.5万用户的实际使用数据进行案例研究。

Result: 研究了三种智能体设计决策对开发者满意度的影响，框架能得出更可靠结论，相比标准A/B测试置信区间缩小40%，发现实际使用结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果为大语言模型智能体的评估提供指导，指出更好智能体设计的机会。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Result: 不同主流意识理论对AI意识判定存在分歧，标准论证作用有限。

Abstract: This is a skeptical overview of the literature on AI consciousness. We will
soon create AI systems that are conscious according to some influential,
mainstream theories of consciousness but are not conscious according to other
influential, mainstream theories of consciousness. We will not be in a position
to know which theories are correct and whether we are surrounded by AI systems
as richly and meaningfully conscious as human beings or instead only by systems
as experientially blank as toasters. None of the standard arguments either for
or against AI consciousness takes us far.

### [4] [The Irrational Machine: Neurosis and the Limits of Algorithmic Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10823)
*Daniel Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出刻画具身体AI神经症的框架，列举多种神经症模态，给出探测器与逃逸策略，指出局部修复不足，提出基于遗传编程的破坏性测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为具身体AI中的神经症行为进行刻画和分析，找出解决问题的方法。

Method: 在网格导航栈中列举神经症模态，给出探测器和逃逸策略，使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试。

Result: 发现即使在全可见条件下，持久的恐惧回避仍会存在，局部修复无法解决全局问题。

Conclusion: 需要进行架构修订，而不仅仅是症状层面的修补。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

### [5] [Beyond AlphaEarth: Toward Human-Centered Spatial Representation via POI-Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09894)
*Junyuan Liu,Quan Qin,Guangsheng Dong,Xinglei Wang,Jiazhuang Feng,Zichao Zeng,Tao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AETHER框架，用POI引导的多模态对齐使AlphaEarth适用于以人类为中心的城市分析，在伦敦取得良好效果，推进地理空间基础模型发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EO驱动的AlphaEarth表征在捕捉城市功能和社会经济维度上有限，需要适用于以人类为中心的城市分析的方法。

Method: 提出AETHER框架，将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI的文本表征对齐，用语义线索丰富EO特征。

Result: 在大伦敦地区，土地利用分类F1值相对提高7.2%，社会经济映射的KL散度相对降低23.6%。

Conclusion: AETHER利用轻量级多模态对齐为AlphaEarth添加以人类为中心的语义，推进地理空间基础模型向通用城市表征发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

TL;DR: 本文探讨基于大语言模型的科学智能体在科学发现中的作用，分析现状、挑战并指明方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型兴起，其衍生的智能体可加速科学发现，需研究其作用与发展。

Method: 批判性审视当前的方法学。

Result: 强调关键创新、实际成果以及突出的局限性。

Conclusion: 自主智能体有加速不同领域科学发现的变革潜力。

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to
accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

### [7] [The Personalization Trap: How User Memory Alters Emotional Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09905)
*Xi Fang,Weijie Xu,Yuchong Zhang,Stephanie Eckman,Scott Nickleach,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型中用户记忆对情商的影响，发现不同用户档案会产生不同情绪解读，个性化机制可能强化社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统纳入长期用户记忆，了解该记忆如何塑造情感推理很关键。

Method: 在人类验证的情商测试中评估15个大语言模型。

Result: 相同场景搭配不同用户档案会产生不同情绪解读，部分高性能LLMs存在系统偏差，LLMs在情绪理解和支持性建议任务上存在人口统计学差异。

Conclusion: 内存增强AI面临关键挑战，个性化系统可能无意中强化社会不平等。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

*Olivia Peiyu Wang,Tashvi Bansal,Ryan Bai,Emily M. Chui,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出大语言模型在逻辑谬误分类上有缺陷，提出低成本指令干预方法，提升了分类效果并增强决策透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在推理缺陷，全系统2训练成本高，需低成本干预方法弥补推理差距。

Method: 引入新颖的逐步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为原子程序步骤，增加最终验证步骤，让模型参考相关谬误的关系知识图。

Result: 该基于规则的干预方法显著提升了大语言模型逻辑谬误分类效果。

Conclusion: 此方法为神经符号架构解决大语言模型推理缺陷提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

### [9] [Deliberative Dynamics and Value Alignment in LLM Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10002)
*Pratik S. Sachdeva,Tom van Nuenen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文用LLM辩论研究多轮对话中模型道德推理的价值对齐，发现不同模型行为、价值模式有差异，且审议格式影响模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在敏感日常场景应用增多，需理解其在多轮复杂道德推理中的价值对齐，现有研究多为单轮提示，缺乏多轮场景研究。

Method: 使用GPT - 4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash三个模型，就Reddit社区1000个日常困境集体分配责任，采用同步和轮询格式测试顺序效应和裁决修订。

Result: 不同模型行为差异大，同步场景下GPT裁决修订率低，Claude和Gemini更灵活；价值模式有分歧；某些价值驱动裁决变化；审议格式对模型行为影响大。

Conclusion: 审议格式和模型特定行为塑造多轮交互中的道德推理，社会技术对齐不仅取决于输出，还取决于对话结构。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

*Meng Xi,Sihan Lv,Yechen Jin,Guanjie Cheng,Naibo Wang,Ying Li,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对检索增强生成（RAG）系统提出RIPRAG攻击框架，利用强化学习优化投毒文档生成，实验表明能有效攻击复杂RAG系统，揭示当前防御方法不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注简化RAG架构的白盒攻击，本文研究攻击者缺乏RAG系统内部信息的更复杂现实场景。

Method: 提出RIPRAG攻击框架，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，利用强化学习优化生成投毒文档。

Result: 该方法能有效对大多数复杂RAG系统执行投毒攻击，攻击成功率比基线方法最高提升0.72。

Conclusion: 当前防御方法存在普遍不足，为大语言模型安全研究提供关键见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

TL;DR: 本文开发框架评估大语言模型战略思维能力，发现其展现信念连贯的最优反应行为、元推理能力及启发式规则，表明语言建模目标可催生战略认知相关能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多评估大语言模型在均衡博弈或推理深度方面的表现，未探究其是否具备真正的战略思维。

Method: 开发框架，在静态、完全信息博弈中分离信念、评估和选择，在一系列非合作环境中应用该框架，联合分析模型选择和推理痕迹，引入新的无上下文游戏排除记忆模仿。

Result: 当前前沿模型在目标推理深度展现信念连贯的最优反应行为，能自我限制推理深度，对人类和合成对手形成不同猜想，在复杂性增加时形成稳定、特定于模型且不同于人类偏差的启发式规则。

Conclusion: 语言建模目标可共同催生信念连贯性、元推理和新型启发式规则形成，为人工代理战略认知研究提供结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标量指标评估候选工作流的全局搜索范式存在信息坍缩问题，无法建模工作流的失败分布。

Method: 将优化目标设定为最小化工作流的预期失败质量，引入CE - Graph框架，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别常见失败模式并进行有针对性的图编辑。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE - Graph以显著更低的成本实现了更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性并非来自避免失败，而是来自系统地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法难以处理企业异构系统中需上下文推理和多跳推理的复杂查询。

Result: 在大规模Git仓库实验中，统一推理层比独立GPT检索管道提高答案相关性达80%。

Conclusion: 框架结合图构建、混合推理和可视化，为企业智能知识助手提供可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Motivation: 从无标签视听流中学习同步感知和可迁移的面部动态，以应用于多个下游任务。

Method: 将掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐相结合，使用三个每帧提示令牌编码面部帧关键因素，通过对比目标实现模态同步。

Result: 在四个不同下游任务中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解式的自监督预训练方法是有效的。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模 IT 系统中手动执行 TSG 缓慢且易出错，现有基于大语言模型的解决方案缺乏对管理 TSG 质量问题等关键挑战的专业支持。

Method: 先对 92 个真实世界的 TSG 进行实证研究，提出 StepFly 框架，该框架具有三阶段工作流程，包括提升 TSG 质量、离线预处理和在线执行。

Result: 在实际 TSG 和事件上，StepFly 在 GPT - 4.1 上成功率约 94%，优于基线，且减少了时间和令牌消耗，对可并行 TSG 执行时间减少 32.9% 至 70.4%。

Conclusion: StepFly 是一种有效的端到端故障排除指南自动化框架，能提升故障排除效率。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估局限于静态单代理任务，需更全面评估。

Method: 引入DixitWorld评估套件，含动态多代理环境DixitArena和静态QA基准DixitBench。

Result: DixitArena中，小开源模型讲故事有创意，大闭源模型整体表现好；DixitBench结果与DixitArena中聆听者结果强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理存在生成创造力和判别理解的权衡，是开发视觉语言代理的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中，显著提升角色保真度、语义对齐和时间连贯性，在拥挤场景中表现稳健，可实现低开销的可扩展多角色生成。

Conclusion: CharCom适合故事插画和动画等实际应用。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型简洁推理方法依赖手工启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性和性能，且跨领域和模型规模适应性差。

Method: 将简洁推理表述为约束优化问题，用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题；通过三种近似简化更新规则。

Result: 应用于DeepSeek - Distill - Qwen - 1.5B时，在五个基准测试中平均减少65%输出长度，提高15%准确率，优于多种替代方法。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，具有跨领域和模型规模的适应性。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性共形预测方法在开放问答场景中假设可通过有限采样获取所有实例的可接受答案不现实，需确保大语言模型输出可信度。

Method: 引入包含弃权感知采样和共形过滤的SAFER两阶段框架，先在验证集校准采样预算，不满足风险水平则弃权，再用共形风险控制方法确定阈值过滤不可靠干扰项。

Result: SAFER兼容多种任务特定准入标准和校准 - 测试分割比例。

Conclusion: SAFER框架能有效控制风险，具有较强的鲁棒性和高数据效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

Motivation: 大语言模型代理开发受限于高质量训练数据稀缺，有监督微调会过拟合，标准强化学习有冷启动和训练不稳定问题。

Method: 引入环境调优训练范式，通过结构化课程、可操作环境增强和细粒度进度奖励确保稳定高效探索。

Result: 仅用400个BFCL基准问题实例，取得有竞争力的分布内性能和优越的分布外泛化能力，克服基于SFT方法的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 实现从静态轨迹有监督微调向动态环境探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the

infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,

Method: 提出PIXEL框架，从双视角学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，进行样本级正交残差校准和轻量级位置扫描，还给出最小干预规则的表示级保证。

Result: 在不同模型和评估范式中，PIXEL持续提升属性对齐，保留模型通用能力。

Conclusion: PIXEL是一种实用且有原则的大语言模型可控生成方法。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 长推理模型存在因过度思考导致计算成本增加和推理延迟问题，需解决这些局限。

Method: 提出支持快速和慢速思考两种推理模式的ADR，推理时根据上下文复杂度动态切换。训练分两阶段：冷启动阶段用监督微调；强化学习阶段引入EHPO优化推理努力。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，ADR在现有方法中有效平衡了推理性能和效率，性能提升达6.1%，推理输出长度减少49.5% - 59.3%。

Conclusion: ADR能有效应对长推理模型的问题，实现推理性能和效率的平衡。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and

Result: 内部实验显示，重组工作流程和用合成数据微调大语言模型显著提升其性能。

Conclusion: 该解决方案具有成本效益，能通过准确性和人工处理时间评估指标提升客户支持质量。

Abstract: We propose a practical approach by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with a framework designed to navigate the complexities of Airbnb customer
support operations. In this paper, our methodology employs a novel reformatting
technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms
policies and workflows into a structure more comprehensible to LLMs.
Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

Result: 识别出市场扩张、风险缓解、性能红利、竞争优势四种驱动回报机制，提出HAIIF框架。

Conclusion: 投资包容性设计可扩大市场覆盖并获得持续竞争优势，忽视则会面临劣势。

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型幻觉等问题，实现可靠部署，研究合适的置信度估计器。

Method: 在多个模型、数据集和提示上进行综合实验，研究推理轨迹长度与准确性的关系，分析其作为置信信号的机制。

Result: 推理轨迹长度与其他零样本置信度估计器表现相当且互补，推理后训练改变了轨迹长度与准确性的关系，调整混杂因素后效果仍存在，高熵或“分叉”标记起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理后训练能提升不确定性量化，推理轨迹长度可作为大推理模型实用的置信度度量。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理电子健康记录（EHR）数据进行患者轨迹建模的时间推理时，受EHR数据长且嘈杂的影响，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 引入Traj - CoA多智能体系统，通过一系列工作智能体按顺序处理EHR数据，将关键事件提炼到共享的长期记忆模块EHRMem中，最后由管理智能体综合信息进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年EHR数据的零样本一年肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj - CoA优于四类基线。

Conclusion: Traj - CoA是一种有前途的、强大且可推广的复杂患者轨迹建模方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

Conclusion: 研究为推理效率提供实用策略，也为潜在空间中推理过程的表示和区分提供解释视角。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Result: 最佳大语言模型准确率仅39.95%，远低于人类；前沿模型的思考模式或RAG系统未提升结果，甚至因过度思考或检索噪声降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在理解学术论文方面与人类能力存在显著差距。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Conclusion: 该工作有助于大语言模型在现实问题解决中实现更稳健和可扩展的推理范式。

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵的RPS距离度量方法是有效的，能更好地处理RPS距离测量问题。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Conclusion: 挑战了梯度优化是训练神经网络唯一可行方法的假设，有降低训练成本、让资源有限群体参与研究的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern

been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear

among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Conclusion: 所提结合LLM与数学优化的混合框架有效，能解决网约车平台供需平衡问题。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 构建诊断知识本体，提出基于FBS模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推理与专家列举的候选原因集更相符，尤其在相关案例少和用词不同的困难情况下。

Conclusion: 未来需开发适配推理方法、构建用户界面并在更多样系统验证，此方法有望成为整个工程链知识共享基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

*Can Xie,Ruotong Pan,Xiangyu Wu,Yunfei Zhang,Jiayi Fu,Tingting Gao,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS)方法改进强化学习奖励分配，实验显示其在数学推理基准上显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法粗粒度优势信号忽略推理中不确定高风险决策，导致探索低效和熵坍塌问题。

Method: 提出无模型方法UCAS，分两步利用模型内部不确定性信号优化信用分配，先调整响应级优势，再进行标记级惩罚。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准实验中，UCAS在多模型规模上显著优于强RLVR基线。

Conclusion: UCAS能获得更高奖励、促进推理多样性并缓解熵坍塌。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Conclusion: simpliflow是在确定性工作流环境中针对简单性、可控性和速度进行优化的工具。

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估音视频协同推理能力，忽略模态或整合逻辑不一致。

Method: 引入OmniVideoBench，包含1000个高质量问答对，来自628个不同视频，有13种精心设计的问题类型。

Result: 多个多模态大语言模型在OmniVideoBench上评估，显示模型性能与人类推理有明显差距，开源模型落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: 发布OmniVideoBench以促进多模态大语言模型推理能力发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 自动演绎中调和演绎完备性与计算效率是长期挑战，传统推理演算有局限，CSE框架算法未形式化。

Method: 提出扩展三角方法（ETM），在三角几何框架内统一多种矛盾构建策略，支持灵活子句交互和动态协同。

Result: ETM作为多个高性能定理证明器的算法核心，在标准一阶基准测试中取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂逻辑推理表现不佳，以往工作仅关注自然语言与符号语言含义相似性，忽略目标符号语言类型选择。

Method: 利用大语言模型在一阶逻辑、逻辑编程和布尔可满足性中选择目标符号语言，将自然语言问题翻译成目标符号语言表达式，用对应逻辑求解器得出答案。

Result: 自适应选择方法显著优于统一翻译和随机选择，在混合数据集上准确率达96%，比一阶逻辑翻译次高准确率提升25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同最优符号语言形式化，自适应选择符号语言可提升大语言模型逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

Motivation: 传统DRL协议泛化性和恢复力差，在动态环境需昂贵的重新训练，因此要克服此局限。

Method: 将基站和用户设备的上行传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，使用LLM驱动智能体通过近端策略优化进行协调，采用协议动作语法确保过程可靠高效，并分析Stackelberg均衡的存在和收敛行为。

Result: 模拟显示框架比传统基线吞吐量提高77.6%，公平性提高65.2%，且无需重新训练或架构更改就能很好地泛化到不同数量用户。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效，能提升网络性能且泛化性良好。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Motivation: 现有工作主要局限于孤立论文的无工具任务，缺乏跨论文推理和多工具编排的基准。

Result: 最先进的大语言模型驱动的智能体平均准确率仅38.78%，难题子集准确率降至18.47%，且所有测试智能体工具使用效率低。

Conclusion: 邀请社区使用PaperArena开发和评估更强大的科学发现智能体。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

Method: 提出Proof - of - Use (PoU)证据驱动的强化学习框架，通过统一的逐步合约，结合句法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案 - 证据对齐目标。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实性和工具路由平衡方面始终优于DeepResearch基线。

Conclusion: 强调强化学习训练的代理不仅要基于任务结果，还需基于检索信息的因果使用，为可信的检索增强推理提供了原则性途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的方法和构建的数据集有效，代码、模型和数据将发布。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 计算论证最能满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，同时指出了如缓解偏见等开放挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

Motivation: 如何做问题开放性使AI智能体提问和专家回答困难，影响高效规划，需解决此问题支持智能体完成当前和未来任务。

Method: 引入How²记忆智能体框架，在Plancraft环境评估，用不同抽象层次教师模型回答问题。

Result: 终身学习智能体从与当前状态抽象解耦的答案中受益最大。

Conclusion: How²为基于大语言模型的智能体在交互式环境中通过提问提升规划能力提供途径。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

### [58] [Aligning Deep Implicit Preferences by Learning to Reason Defensively](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11194)
*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Critique - Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA)方法解决大语言模型个性化对齐问题，实验证明其有效性，代码和数据集开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型个性化对齐方法无法推断用户深层隐含偏好且缺乏防御性推理，导致回复肤浅、脆弱和短视。

Method: 提出CDRA，引入DeepPref基准数据集解决偏好推断问题，提出Personalized Generative Process Reward Model (Pers - GenPRM)实现防御性推理，通过Critique - Driven Policy Alignment引导策略模型。

Result: 实验表明CDRA能出色发现并与用户真实偏好对齐，同时执行稳健推理。

Conclusion: CDRA是解决大语言模型个性化对齐问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

Method: 分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种失败模式

Result: 文中未提及具体结果

Conclusion: 文中未提及明确结论，将讨论结果对理解当前风险和研究优先级的影响

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

TL;DR: 介绍PADME框架，可将程序文本转为可执行图，分两阶段工作，在多个基准测试中达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型驱动的智能体在执行自然语言长程序时易出错的问题。

Method: 提出PADME框架，分Teach和Execute两阶段，将程序文本转为可执行图。

Result: PADME在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个基准测试中取得SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 基于图的程序表示为可靠且可泛化的执行提供了强大的中间抽象。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Conclusion: AAS系统提供了从‘经验时代’到‘模拟时代’的基础，能生成高保真行为和交互数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

Result: DRM提供有效监督信号，引导大语言模型优化，在分布内和分布外开放域任务上取得一致收益。

Conclusion: 推理过程的多维监督能提升大语言模型超越训练分布的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

Method: 提出DARK框架，包含自我反思去噪过程用于溯因推理时利用演绎优化假设，提出逻辑探索强化学习方法同时掩码查询和结论以发现更丰富逻辑关联。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: 统一演绎和溯因推理的方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI

for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

Result: CAP - CPT在所有设置下均优于SFT基线，在Qwen - 3 - 32B上有显著提升，在CC - Gen上实现97.3%提示长度减少，用最少SFT数据增强tau - Bench。

Conclusion: CAP - CPT能有效缓解数据和推理负担，提升大语言模型代理系统策略内化性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Result: 提出AI研究采用更严格可重复性指南能助力治理，改善对AI风险的共识。

Conclusion: 政策制定者和政府应将可重复性协议作为治理的核心工具，对AI研究提出更高标准。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

Motivation: 在线零售中获客成本高于客户留存成本，且当代许多流失模型是黑盒，缺乏对客户流失决定因素、留存机会时机和高风险客户细分的洞察，因此需转向基于可解释证据的个性化留存策略设计。

Method: 提出一个三组件框架，集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模事件发生时间的流失风险、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户。

Result: 这些方法结合可归因流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、对细分市场进行优先级排序。

Conclusion: 该框架支持减少客户流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous

time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate
of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance

Method: 引入应用特定心理健康原则进行宪法AI训练的方法。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved
communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness
platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an
approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health
principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health
applications.

Method: 提出Dual - Attention Semantic Parallel - LSTM Network (DA - SPL)框架，采用编码器 - 解码器结构，结合联合双注意力机制、并行LSTM解码器架构和标签增强模块。

Result: 在标准青光眼数据集上严格评估，DA - SPL在定量指标上始终优于现有模型，能提取细微病理指标，生成与专家注释高度一致的诊断报告。

Conclusion: DA - SPL框架有效解决了生成AI在青光眼诊断报告生成中的问题，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Generative AI for automated glaucoma diagnostic report generation faces two
predominant challenges: content redundancy in narrative outputs and inadequate
highlighting of pathologically significant features including optic disc
cupping, retinal nerve fiber layer defects, and visual field abnormalities.
These limitations primarily stem from current multimodal architectures'
insufficient capacity to extract discriminative structural-textural patterns
from fundus imaging data while maintaining precise semantic alignment with
domain-specific terminology in comprehensive clinical reports. To overcome
these constraints, we present the Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM Network
(DA-SPL), an advanced multimodal generation framework that synergistically
processes both fundus imaging and supplementary visual inputs. DA-SPL employs
an Encoder-Decoder structure augmented with the novel joint dual-attention
mechanism in the encoder for cross-modal feature refinement, the parallelized
LSTM decoder architecture for enhanced temporal-semantic consistency, and the
specialized label enhancement module for accurate disease-relevant term
generation. Rigorous evaluation on standard glaucoma datasets demonstrates
DA-SPL's consistent superiority over state-of-the-art models across
quantitative metrics. DA-SPL exhibits exceptional capability in extracting
subtle pathological indicators from multimodal inputs while generating
diagnostically precise reports that exhibit strong concordance with clinical
expert annotations.

Abstract: Predicting stock returns remains a central challenge in quantitative finance,
transitioning from traditional statistical methods to contemporary deep
learning techniques. However, many current models struggle with effectively
capturing spatio-temporal dynamics and integrating multiple relational data
sources. This study proposes GrifFinNet, a Graph-Relation Integrated
Transformer for Financial Predictions, which combines multi-relational graph
modeling with Transformer-based temporal encoding. GrifFinNet constructs
inter-stock relation graphs based on industry sectors and institutional
ownership, and incorporates an adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically
integrate relational data in response to changing market conditions. This
approach enables the model to jointly capture spatial dependencies and temporal
patterns, offering a comprehensive representation of market dynamics. Extensive
experiments on two Chinese A-share indices show that GrifFinNet consistently
outperforms several baseline models and provides valuable, interpretable
insights into financial market behavior. The code and data are available at:

Abstract: This contribution presents a model order reduction strategy for fast
parametric modelling of problems with cracks formulated on spline
discretizations. In the context of damage detection, parametric reduced order
models (ROMs) are well suited for fast computations by establishing an
efficient offline/online split of the simulation process. The problems of
interest focus on geometric parameters that describe the crack configuration
and may pose challenges to constructing efficient ROMs. This work proposes a
framework based on non-intrusive reduced basis methods and a localization
strategy tailored to parametric problems with moving discontinuities. The
combined benefits of non-intrusive ROMs and localization enable accurate and
efficient reduction with low online cost. We demonstrate the applicability of
the ROM approach with benchmark tests on linear elastic problems discretized
with splines and the extended isogeometric method (XIGA) for crack modelling.
The results we obtain show the accuracy and real-time efficiency of the
constructed reduced order models.

Abstract: In-stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention is a
multifactorial process. Specific morphological lesion characteristics were
observed to contribute to the occurrence of in-stent restenosis. Local
mechanical factors, such as stresses and strains, are known to influence tissue
adaptation after stent implantation. However, the influence of morphological
features on those local mechanical states and, hence, on the occurrence of
in-stent restenosis remains understudied. This work investigates the
correlation between local mechanical quantities and in-stent restenosis by
evaluating the stress distributions in the artery wall during and after stent
implantation for informative lesion morphologies. We perform computational
simulations of the stenting procedure with physics-based patient-specific
coronary artery models. Different morphologies are assessed using the spatial
plaque composition information from high-resolution coronary computed
tomography angiography data. We quantify the correlation between in-stent
restenosis and local tensional stresses. We found that specific morphological
characteristics like circumferential or asymmetric block calcifications result
in higher stresses in the surrounding tissue. This study concludes that local
stresses are critical for assessing the individual in-stent restenosis risk.

Abstract: This work presents an objective, repeatable, automatic, and fast methodology
for assessing the representativeness of geophysical variables sampled by
Earth-observing satellites. The primary goal is to identify and mitigate
potential sampling biases attributed to orbit selection during pre-Phase A
mission studies. This methodology supports current incubation activities for a
future Planetary Boundary Layer observing system by incorporating a sampling
effectiveness measure into a broader architectural study. The study evaluates
the effectiveness of 20 satellite configurations for observing convective storm
activity in the Southwestern U.S. during the North American Monsoon (NAM)
season. The primary design variables are the number of satellites, orbit type
(sun-synchronous or inclined), and Local Time of Ascending Node (LTAN). Using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to assess observational representativeness and
Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate probability density functions, the
study quantifies the discrepancy between observed and ground truth storm
features. Results indicate that a two-satellite sun-synchronous system with an
8:00 PM LTAN, achieved the lowest KL divergence, signifying the most
representative observation of storm clusters. In contrast, single-satellite
configurations, particularly those with late-night LTANs (e.g., 12:00 AM),
demonstrated significantly higher KL divergence. The study concludes that
dual-satellite configurations in sun-synchronous orbits with evening LTANs
outperform single-satellite and inclined configurations in capturing
representative convective storm activity. Keywords: Earth-Observing Satellites;

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments
is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems
(CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of
preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within
environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep
learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual
dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most
effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a
comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and
standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a
simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this
illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability
to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models
are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by
heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability
score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the
seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for
imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network
architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built
environments.

Abstract: Many real-world inverse problems suffer from limited data, often because they
rely on measurements of a single physical field. Such data frequently fail to
sufficiently reduce parameter uncertainty in Bayesian inverse analysis.
Incorporating easily available data from additional physical fields can
substantially decrease this uncertainty. We focus on Bayesian inverse analyses
based on computational models, e.g., those using the finite element method. To
incorporate data from additional physical fields, the computational model must
be extended to include these fields. While this model extension may have little
to no effect on forward model predictions, it can greatly enhance inverse
analysis by leveraging the multi-physics data. Our work proposes this
multi-physics-enhanced inverse approach and demonstrates its potential using
two models: a simple model with one-way coupled fields and a complex
computational model with fully coupled fields. We quantify the uncertainty
reduction by comparing the effect of single-physics and multi-physics data on
the information gain from the prior to the posterior. Our results show that
even a few or noisy data points from an additional physical field can
considerably increase the information gain, even if this field is weakly or
one-way coupled. Although multi-physics data are often readily available, it is
remarkable that their potential has been largely neglected in model calibration
so far. Instead, costly and time-consuming additional experimental setups are
often pursued. In contrast, incorporating multi-physics data requires minimal
effort when multi-physics models are readily available or easy to implement, as
is the case with uncoupled and one-way coupled models. This work proposes and
promotes the future use of multi-physics-enhanced Bayesian inverse analysis as
a cost- and time-saving game-changer across various fields of science and
industry.

Abstract: Quick commerce (q-commerce) is one of the fastest growing sectors in India.
It provides informal employment to approximately 4,50,000 workers, and it is
estimated to become a USD 200 Billion industry by 2026. A significant portion
of this industry deals with perishable goods. (e.g. milk, dosa batter etc.)
These are food items which are consumed relatively fresh by the consumers and
therefore their order volume is high and repetitive even when the average
basket size is relatively small. The fundamental challenge for the retailer is
that, increasing selling price would hamper sales and would lead to unsold
inventory. On the other hand setting a price less, would lead to forgoing of
potential revenue. This paper attempts to propose a mathematical model which
formalizes this dilemma. The problem statement is not only important for
improving the unit economics of the perennially loss making quick commerce
firms, but also would lead to a trickle-down effect in improving the conditions
of the gig workers as observed in [4]. The sections below describe the
mathematical formulation. The results from the simulation would be published in
a follow-up study.

Abstract: Solving large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on complex
three-dimensional geometries represents a central challenge in scientific and
engineering computing, often impeded by expensive pre-processing stages and
substantial computational overhead. We introduce Low-Rank Query-based PDE
Solver (LRQ-Solver), a physics-integrated framework engineered for rapid,
accurate, and highly scalable simulations of industrial-grade models. This
framework is built upon two primary technical innovations. First, our Parameter
Conditioned Lagrangian Modeling (PCLM) approach explicitly couples local
physical states with global design parameters, enabling robust predictions
across varied simulation configurations. By embedding physical consistency
directly into the learning architecture, PCLM ensures that predictions remain
physically meaningful even under unseen design conditions, significantly
enhancing generalization and reliability. Second, the Low-Rank Query Attention
(LR-QA) module leverages the second-order statistics of physical fields to
construct a global coherence kernel, reducing the computational complexity of
attention from O(N2) to O(NC2 + C3). By replacing point-wise clustering with
covariance decomposition, LRQ-Solver achieves exceptional scalability
efficiently processing up to 2 million points on a single GPU. Validated on
standard benchmarks, LRQ-Solver achieves a 38.9% error reduction on the
DrivAer++ dataset and 28.76% on the 3D Beam dataset, alongside a training
speedup of up to 50 times. Our results establish that LRQ-Solver offers a
powerful paradigm for multi-configuration physics simulations, delivering a
SOTA combination of accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. Code to reproduce
the experiments is available at https://github.com/LilaKen/LRQ-Solver.

Abstract: Timely detection of critical health conditions remains a major challenge in
public health analytics, especially in Big Data environments characterized by
high volume, rapid velocity, and diverse variety of clinical data. This study
presents an ontology-enabled real-time analytics framework that integrates
Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable
intelligent health event detection and semantic reasoning over heterogeneous,
high-velocity health data streams. The architecture leverages the Basic Formal
Ontology (BFO) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to model diagnostic rules
and domain knowledge. Patient data is ingested and processed using Apache Kafka
and Spark Streaming, where CEP engines detect clinically significant event
patterns. LLMs support adaptive reasoning, event interpretation, and ontology
refinement. Clinical information is semantically structured as Resource
Description Framework (RDF) triples in Graph DB, enabling SPARQL-based querying
and knowledge-driven decision support. The framework is evaluated using a
dataset of 1,000 Tuberculosis (TB) patients as a use case, demonstrating
low-latency event detection, scalable reasoning, and high model performance (in
terms of precision, recall, and F1-score). These results validate the system's
potential for generalizable, real-time health analytics in complex Big Data

Conclusion: TAUSQ - PG算法显著提高了运行时间和内存效率。

Abstract: Incorporating utility into targeted pattern mining can address the practical
limitations of traditional frequency-based approaches. However, utility-based
methods often suffer from generating a large number of long and complicated
sequences. To improve pattern relevance and interpretability, average utility
provides a more balanced metric by considering both utility and sequence
length. Moreover, incorporating user-defined query targets into the mining
process enhances usability and interactivity by retaining only patterns
containing user-specified goals. To address challenges related to mining
efficiency in large-scale, long-sequence datasets, this study introduces
average utility into targeted sequential pattern mining. A novel algorithm,
TAUSQ-PG, is designed to find targeted high average utility sequential
patterns. It incorporates efficient filtering and pruning strategies, tighter
upper bound models, as well as novel specialized evaluation metrics and query
flags tailored to this task. Extensive comparative experiments on different
datasets demonstrate that TAUSQ-PG effectively controls the candidate set size,
thereby reducing redundant sequence generation and significantly improving
runtime and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: HMGI框架能有效结合语义相似性搜索和关系上下文，解决现有数据库的不足，实现高效的多模态数据查询。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, multimodal datasets has exposed a critical gap
between the capabilities of specialized vector databases and traditional graph
databases. While vector databases excel at semantic similarity search, they
lack the capacity for deep relational querying. Conversely, graph databases
master complex traversals but are not natively optimized for high-dimensional
vector search. This paper introduces the Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI),
a novel framework designed to bridge this gap by creating a unified system for
efficient, hybrid queries on multimodal data. HMGI leverages the native graph
database architecture and integrated vector search capabilities, exemplified by
platforms like Neo4j, to combine Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
with expressive graph traversal queries. Key innovations of the HMGI framework
include modality-aware partitioning of embeddings to optimize index structure
and query performance, and a system for adaptive, low-overhead index updates to
support dynamic data ingestion, drawing inspiration from the architectural
principles of systems like TigerVector. By integrating semantic similarity
search directly with relational context, HMGI aims to outperform pure vector
databases like Milvus in complex, relationship-heavy query scenarios and
achieve sub-linear query times for hybrid tasks.

Abstract: Discovering valuable insights from rich data is a crucial task for
exploratory data analysis. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has found widespread
applications across various domains. In recent years, low-utility sequential
pattern mining (LUSPM) has shown strong potential in applications such as
intrusion detection and genomic sequence analysis. However, existing research
in utility-based SPM focuses on high-utility sequential patterns, and the
definitions and strategies used in high-utility SPM cannot be directly applied
to LUSPM. Moreover, no algorithms have yet been developed specifically for
mining low-utility sequential patterns. To address these problems, we formalize
the LUSPM problem, redefine sequence utility, and introduce a compact data
structure called the sequence-utility chain to efficiently record utility
information. Furthermore, we propose three novel algorithm--LUSPM_b, LUSPM_s,
and LUSPM_e--to discover the complete set of low-utility sequential patterns.
LUSPM_b serves as an exhaustive baseline, while LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e build upon
it, generating subsequences through shrinkage and extension operations,
respectively. In addition, we introduce the maximal non-mutually contained
sequence set and incorporate multiple pruning strategies, which significantly
reduce redundant operations in both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e. Finally, extensive
experimental results demonstrate that both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e substantially
outperform LUSPM_b and exhibit excellent scalability. Notably, LUSPM_e achieves
superior efficiency, requiring less runtime and memory consumption than
LUSPM_s. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhidong-Lin/LUSPM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个用于日志数据正则表达式查询的高效索引系统。

Method: 采用基于n - gram的索引策略和高效存储机制。

Result: 比无索引的正则处理引擎快14倍，仅用2.1%额外空间；发现文本处理库常用的倒排索引等策略在日志分析的正则索引中性能不佳。

Conclusion: REI系统在日志数据正则表达式查询上有显著提升，且模块化易部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and architecture of REI, a novel system
for indexing log data for regular expression queries. Our main contribution is
an $n$-gram-based indexing strategy and an efficient storage mechanism that
results in a speedup of up to 14x compared to state-of-the-art regex processing
engines that do not use indexing, using only 2.1% of extra space. We perform a
detailed study that analyzes the space usage of the index and the improvement
in workload execution time, uncovering interesting insights. Specifically, we
show that even an optimized implementation of strategies such as inverted
indexing, which are widely used in text processing libraries, may lead to
suboptimal performance for regex indexing on log analysis tasks. Overall, the
REI approach presented in this paper provides a significant boost when
evaluating regular expression queries on log data. REI is also modular and can
work with existing regular expression packages, making it easy to deploy in a
variety of settings. The code of REI is available at
https://github.com/mush-zhang/REI-Regular-Expression-Indexing.

*Jiahao He,Yutao Cui,Cuiping Li,Jikang Jiang,Yuheng Hou,Hong Chen*

TL;DR: 本文提出结合LQO和AQP优势的自适应查询优化器AQORA，通过四个核心策略应对现有方法挑战，实验表明其能显著降低执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习查询优化（LQO）和自适应查询处理（AQP）方法存在局限性，如LQO学习效率低、AQP依赖启发式规则且缺乏学习能力。

Method: 提出自适应查询优化器AQORA，采用现实特征编码、查询阶段级反馈和干预、自动策略适应、低成本集成四个核心策略。

Result: 实验显示，与其他学习方法相比，AQORA最多可减少90%的端到端执行时间；与Spark SQL默认配置的自适应查询执行相比，最多可减少70%。

Conclusion: AQORA结合了LQO和AQP的优势，能有效应对现有方法的挑战，显著提升查询优化性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have identified two main approaches to improve query
optimization: learned query optimization (LQO), which generates or selects
better query plans before execution based on models trained in advance, and
adaptive query processing (AQP), which adapts the query plan during execution
based on statistical feedback collected at runtime. Although both approaches
have shown promise, they also face critical limitations. LQO must commit to a
fixed plan without access to actual cardinalities and typically rely on a
single end-to-end feedback signal, making learning inefficient. On the other
hand, AQP depends heavily on rule-based heuristics and lacks the ability to
learn from experience. In this paper, we present AQORA, an adaptive query
optimizer with a reinforcement learning architecture that combines the
strengths of both LQO and AQP. AQORA addresses the above challenges through
four core strategies: (1) realistic feature encoding, (2) query stage-level
feedback and intervention, (3) automatic strategy adaptation, and (4) low-cost
integration. Experiments show that AQORA reduces end-to-end execution time by
up to 90% compared to other learned methods and by up to 70% compared to Spark
SQL's default configuration with adaptive query execution.

*Guanli Liu,Renata Borovica-Gajic*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 现有数据库基准测试缺乏对数据和工作负载漂移建模的支持，本文提出统一分类法和DriftBench框架解决此问题，并通过案例证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试是静态的，缺乏对数据和工作负载漂移建模的支持，且缺少相关定义和生成工具。

Method: 提出统一的分类法，在此基础上引入轻量级、可扩展的DriftBench框架。

Result: 分类法和DriftBench框架为基准测试中的漂移建模和生成提供了标准化的词汇和机制。

Conclusion: 通过案例研究证明了分类法和DriftBench框架的有效性。

Abstract: Data and workload drift are key to evaluating database components such as
caching, cardinality estimation, indexing, and query optimization. Yet,
existing benchmarks are static, offering little to no support for modeling
drift. This limitation stems from the lack of clear definitions and tools for
generating data and workload drift. Motivated by this gap, we propose a unified
taxonomy for data and workload drift, grounded in observations from both
academia and industry. Building on this foundation, we introduce DriftBench, a
lightweight and extensible framework for generating data and workload drift in
benchmark inputs. Together, the taxonomy and DriftBench provide a standardized
vocabulary and mechanism for modeling and generating drift in benchmarking. We
demonstrate their effectiveness through case studies involving data drift,
workload drift, and drift-aware cardinality estimation.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出学习型预取器GrASP，能解决现有方法在动态数据集和隐私约束下的问题，实验显示有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的预取器在动态数据集和隐私约束下表现不佳，需要能从样本有效学习的预取器。

Method: 提出GrASP，利用逻辑块地址增量，结合查询表示和结果编码，将预取视为上下文感知多标签分类任务，用多层LSTM预测增量模式。

Result: GrASP能泛化到比训练数据大250倍的数据集，相比现有基线，命中率最高提升45%，I/O时间最多降低60%，端到端查询执行延迟最多降低55%。平均命中率91.4%，I/O时间减少90.8%，执行延迟减少57.1%。

Conclusion: GrASP在处理动态数据集时无需大量重新训练，能有效提升预取准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Data prefetching--loading data into the cache before it is requested--is
essential for reducing I/O overhead and improving database performance. While
traditional prefetchers focus on sequential patterns, recent learning-based
approaches, especially those leveraging data semantics, achieve higher accuracy
for complex access patterns. However, these methods often struggle with today's
dynamic, ever-growing datasets and require frequent, timely fine-tuning.
Privacy constraints may also restrict access to complete datasets,
necessitating prefetchers that can learn effectively from samples. To address
these challenges, we present GrASP, a learning-based prefetcher designed for
both analytical and transactional workloads. GrASP enhances prefetching
accuracy and scalability by leveraging logical block address deltas and
combining query representations with result encodings. It frames prefetching as
a context-aware multi-label classification task, using multi-layer LSTMs to
predict delta patterns from embedded context. This delta modeling approach
enables GrASP to generalize predictions from small samples to larger, dynamic
datasets without requiring extensive retraining. Experiments on real-world
datasets and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that GrASP generalizes to
datasets 250 times larger than the training data, achieving up to 45% higher
hit ratios, 60% lower I/O time, and 55% lower end-to-end query execution
latency than existing baselines. On average, GrASP attains a 91.4% hit ratio, a
90.8% I/O time reduction, and a 57.1% execution latency reduction.

TL;DR: 介绍Neptune Analytics图数据库服务的Poseidon引擎，支持多种图工作负载，结合先进事务处理与新颖图数据索引，性能良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足从简单事务到全图分析等广泛图工作负载需求，处理动态图用例，如实时欺诈检测。

Method: 结合先进事务处理与新颖图数据索引，包括无锁邻接表维护、二级简洁索引、分区堆存储数据元组、创新统计用于基于成本的查询优化，使用逻辑日志保证持久性。

Result: 批量数据加载在许多数据集上每秒超过1000万个属性值，简单事务在存储引擎上执行时间低于20ms。

Conclusion: Poseidon引擎能有效支持多种图工作负载，结合新方法有良好性能表现。

Abstract: We present the Poseidon engine behind the Neptune Analytics graph database
service. Customers interact with Poseidon using the declarative openCypher
query language, which enables requests that seamlessly combine traditional
querying paradigms (such as graph pattern matching, variable length paths,
aggregation) with algorithm invocations and has been syntactically extended to
facilitate OneGraph interoperability, such as the disambiguation between
globally unique IRIs (as exposed via RDF) vs. local identifiers (as encountered
in LPG data). Poseidon supports a broad range of graph workloads, from simple
transactions, to top-k beam search algorithms on dynamic graphs, to whole graph
analytics requiring multiple full passes over the data. For example, real-time
fraud detection, like many other use cases, needs to reflect current committed
state of the dynamic graph. If a users cell phone is compromised, then all
newer actions by that user become immediately suspect. To address such dynamic
graph use cases, Poseidon combines state-of-the-art transaction processing with
novel graph data indexing, including lock-free maintenance of adjacency lists,
secondary succinct indices, partitioned heaps for data tuple storage with
uniform placement, and innovative statistics for cost-based query optimization.
The Poseidon engine uses a logical log for durability, enabling rapid evolution
of in-memory data structures. Bulk data loads achieve more than 10 million
property values per second on many data sets while simple transactions can
execute in under 20ms against the storage engine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工作负载随时间显著波动及异构系统中，实现系统资源动态适配以提高能效。

Method: 部署THEAS算法，并将其与CFS、EAS、HeteroSched和基于效用的调度等知名调度技术进行对比分析。

Result: THEAS算法能平衡性能和功耗，适用于多种实时应用。

Conclusion: THEAS算法在资源动态适配方面有优势，适用于广泛的实时应用场景。

Abstract: The dynamic adaptation of resource levels enables the system to enhance
energy efficiency while maintaining the necessary computational resources,
particularly in scenarios where workloads fluctuate significantly over time.
The proposed approach can play a crucial role in heterogeneous systems where
workload characteristics are not uniformly distributed, such as non-pinning
tasks. The deployed THEAS algorithm in this research work ensures a balance
between performance and power consumption, making it suitable for a wide range
of real-time applications. A comparative analysis of the proposed THEAS
algorithm with well-known scheduling techniques such as Completely Fair
Scheduler (CFS), Energy-Aware Scheduling (EAS), Heterogeneous Scheduling
(HeteroSched), and Utility-Based Scheduling is presented in Table III. Each
scheme is compared based on adaptability, core selection criteria, performance
scaling, cache awareness, overhead, and real-time suitability.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 介绍QONNECT框架解决跨云、雾和边缘环境应用编排问题，通过分布式架构和YAML接口实现QoS驱动部署，经测试展示多种自动化能力，统一云边连续体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用跨云、雾和边缘环境部署，标准Kubernetes调度器无法满足用户自定义目标，需手动决策，因此需要新的编排系统。

Method: 提出QONNECT框架，采用分布式架构，由中央知识库、Raft复制资源领导代理和轻量级资源代理组成，通过YAML接口将用户QoS目标转化为具体操作。

Result: 在多达九个云 - 雾 - 边缘集群的联合测试平台上评估，展示动态策略驱动的微服务放置、自动故障转移、符合QoS的重新调度和节点故障后的领导者重新选举等能力。

Conclusion: QONNECT缩小了声明式部署模型和操作QoS目标之间的差距，将云边连续体转变为统一的自优化平台。

Abstract: Modern applications increasingly span across cloud, fog, and edge
environments, demanding orchestration systems that can adapt to diverse
deployment contexts while meeting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.
Standard Kubernetes schedulers do not account for user-defined objectives such
as energy efficiency, cost optimization, and global performance, often leaving
operators to make manual, cluster-by-cluster placement decisions. To address
this need, we present QONNECT, a vendor-agnostic orchestration framework that
enables declarative, QoS-driven application deployment across heterogeneous
Kubernetes and K3s clusters. QONNECT introduces a distributed architecture
composed of a central Knowledge Base, Raft-replicated Resource Lead Agents, and
lightweight Resource Agents in each cluster. Through a minimal YAML-based
interface, users specify high-level QoS goals, which the system translates into
concrete placement and migration actions. Our implementation is evaluated on a
federated testbed of up to nine cloud-fog-edge clusters using the Istio
Bookinfo microservice application. The system demonstrates dynamic,
policy-driven microservice placement, automated failover, QoS-compliant
rescheduling, and leader re-election after node failure, all without manual
intervention. By bridging the gap between declarative deployment models and
operational QoS goals, QONNECT transforms the cloud-edge continuum into a
unified, self-optimizing platform.

TL;DR: 提出FedMon框架用于Kubernetes多集群异常检测，结合eBPF和联邦学习，效果好且省带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes多集群部署需要可扩展且保护隐私的异常检测，现有方法存在局限。

Method: 提出FedMon框架，用轻量级eBPF代理捕获事件、提取特征，结合VAE和孤立森林构建混合检测引擎。

Result: 在三个Kubernetes集群部署，精度94%、召回率91%、F1分数0.92，带宽使用减少60%。

Conclusion: FedMon提高了准确性、可扩展性和隐私性，为大规模多租户云原生环境提供有效防御。

Abstract: Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments demand scalable and privacy-preserving
anomaly detection. Existing eBPF-based monitors provide low-overhead system and
network visibility but are limited to single clusters, while centralized
approaches incur bandwidth, privacy, and heterogeneity challenges. We propose
FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that unifies kernel-level telemetry with
federated learning (FL) for cross-cluster anomaly detection. Lightweight eBPF
agents capture syscalls and network events, extract local statistical and
sequence features, and share only model updates with a global server. A hybrid
detection engine combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Isolation
Forests enables both temporal pattern modeling and outlier detection. Deployed
across three Kubernetes clusters, FedMon achieves 94% precision, 91% recall,
and an F1-score of 0.92, while cutting bandwidth usage by 60% relative to
centralized baselines. Results demonstrate that FedMon enhances accuracy,
scalability, and privacy, providing an effective defense for large-scale,
multi-tenant cloud-native environments.

Motivation: 解决边缘计算中满足SLA的资源扩展问题，现有自动缩放算法有性能和配置复杂性问题。

Method: 简要概述边缘计算架构等，介绍SLA及现有算法。

Result: 梳理了边缘计算架构等内容，分析现有算法利弊。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但指出需解决现有算法问题以满足SLA。

Abstract: Edge computing allows for the decentralization of computing resources. This
decentralization is achieved through implementing microservice architectures,
which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA)
such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud
computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to
handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure
SLA compliance. Several auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to try to
achieve these compliance challenges, but they suffer from performance issues
and configuration complexity. This chapter provides a brief overview of edge
computing architecture, its uses, benefits, and challenges for resource
scaling. We then introduce Service Level Agreements, and existing research on
devising algorithms used in edge computing environments to meet these
agreements, along with their benefits and drawbacks.

Motivation: Mixture - of - Experts (MoE)与speculative decoding (SD)结合时会出现GPU内存膨胀和CPU - GPU带宽竞争问题，现有MoE卸载系统未解决此瓶颈。

Method: 引入投机专家预取、截止层策略和带异步预取线程与批量I/O的流水线运行时。

Result: 在不同数据集、环境和基于MoE的模型上，SP - MoE比现有技术实现了1.07 - 3.5倍的TPOT加速。

Conclusion: SP - MoE是解决MoE与SD结合瓶颈的有效框架，能显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely adopted in large
language models (LLMs) to reduce computation cost through model sparsity.
Employing speculative decoding (SD) can further accelerate MoE inference by
drafting multiple tokens per step and verifying them in parallel. However,
combining MoE with SD inflates GPU memory and aggravates CPU-GPU bandwidth
contention during multi-token verification. Existing MoE offloading systems are
SD-agnostic and do not address this bottleneck. We present SP-MoE, the first
SD-aware expert-offloading and compute-communication pipelining framework.
SP-MoE introduces: (1) speculative expert prefetching that exploits structural
correspondence between the draft and target models to prefetch likely experts
ahead of verification; (2) a cutoff-layer policy that bounds per-layer prefetch
depth based on empirical profiles and an analytical latency model, guaranteeing
just-in-time availability without overfetch; and (3) a pipelined runtime with
asynchronous prefetch threads and batched I/O to hide loading latency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-MoE achieves a 1.07-3.5 times TPOT
speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, environments,
and MoE-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前云原生应用计算资源管理研究主要围绕设置最优CPU - limits，但实际云用户经验显示其对应用性能有害，与传统认知矛盾，需要重新审视。

Method: 通过实际云用户的经验以及提供实证证据来论证观点。

Result: 表明CPU - limits对延迟敏感应用有害，应完全弃用；同时指出在特定场景（如后台作业）合理使用可带来益处。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考自动缩放和计费模式，为研究开辟新途径，且应根据不同场景合理使用CPU - limits。

Abstract: Research in compute resource management for cloud-native applications is
dominated by the problem of setting optimal CPU limits -- a fundamental OS
mechanism that strictly restricts a container's CPU usage to its specified
CPU-limits . Rightsizing and autoscaling works have innovated on
allocation/scaling policies assuming the ubiquity and necessity of CPU-limits .
We question this. Practical experiences of cloud users indicate that CPU-limits
harms application performance and costs more than it helps. These observations
are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom presented in both academic
research and industry best practices. We argue that this indiscriminate
adoption of CPU-limits is driven by erroneous beliefs that CPU-limits is
essential for operational and safety purposes. We provide empirical evidence
making a case for eschewing CPU-limits completely from latency-sensitive
applications. This prompts a fundamental rethinking of auto-scaling and billing
paradigms and opens new research avenues. Finally, we highlight specific
scenarios where CPU-limits can be beneficial if used in a well-reasoned way
(e.g. background jobs).

TL;DR: 提出MMFL训练框架FLAMMABLE，开发基准平台评估，性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方案无法有效解决MMFL中模型精度和训练时间优化的挑战，需适应数据、系统和模型的异质性。

Method: 提出FLAMMABLE框架，智能调整客户端批量大小，让客户端训练多个选定模型；开发MMFL基准平台。

Result: 在多数据集和模型上评估，FLAMMABLE使MMFL时间 - 精度性能提升1.1 - 10.0倍，最终模型精度提高1.3 - 5.4%。

Conclusion: FLAMMABLE能有效优化MMFL训练，提升性能和精度。

Abstract: Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) is an emerging direction in Federated
Learning (FL) where multiple models are trained in parallel, generally on
various datasets. Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the
MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients
as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due
to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor
na\"ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL
training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently
adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully
chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round.
To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL
setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL
time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final
model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.

Motivation: 现有上下文并行方法采用静态配置，忽略训练数据动态性，导致通信开销大与计算不平衡。

Method: 提出DCP框架，对数据和计算进行细粒度分块，灵活映射数据和计算块到设备。

Result: 微基准测试中，DCP在因果掩码下加速注意力1.19x~2.45x，稀疏注意力模式下加速2.15x~3.77x；端到端训练因果掩码加速0.94x~1.16x，稀疏掩码加速1.00x~1.46x。

Conclusion: DCP能适应不同序列特征，有效减少通信，改善内存和计算平衡，提升训练速度。

Abstract: Context parallelism has emerged as a key technique to support long-context
training, a growing trend in generative AI for modern large models. However,
existing context parallel methods rely on static parallelization configurations
that overlook the dynamic nature of training data, specifically, the
variability in sequence lengths and token relationships (i.e., attention
patterns) across samples. As a result, these methods often suffer from
unnecessary communication overhead and imbalanced computation. In this paper,
we present DCP, a dynamic context parallel training framework that introduces
fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation. By enabling
flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to devices, DCP can adapt to
varying sequence characteristics, effectively reducing communication and
improving memory and computation balance. Micro-benchmarks demonstrate that DCP
accelerates attention by 1.19x~2.45x under causal masks and 2.15x~3.77x under
sparse attention patterns. Additionally, we observe up to 0.94x~1.16x
end-to-end training speed-up for causal masks, and 1.00x~1.46x for sparse
masks.

Result: 生成的协议经FDR验证表现如锁定互斥锁。

Conclusion: 公平性预言和基于稳定性的证明方法可在协程运行时设计中复用，无锁队列能确保进程访问共享资源的控制和公平性。

Abstract: We present the first spin-free, kernel-lock-free mutex that cooperates with
user-mode schedulers and is formally proven FIFO-fair and linearizable using
CSP/FDR. Our fairness oracle and stability-based proof method are reusable
across coroutine runtime designs. We designed the claim/release protocol for a
process-oriented language -- ProcessJ -- to manage the race for claiming shared
inter-process communication channels. Internally, we use a lock-free queue to
park waiting processes for gaining access to a shared object, such as exclusive
access to a shared channel to read from or write to. The queue ensures control
and fairness for processes wishing to access a shared resource, as the protocol
handles claim requests in the order they are inserted into the queue. We
produce CSP models of our protocol and a mutex specification, demonstrating
with FDR that our protocol behaves as a locking mutex.

Abstract: As microservice-based systems scale across the cloud-edge continuum,
traditional centralized scheduling mechanisms increasingly struggle with
latency, coordination overhead, and fault tolerance. This paper presents a new
architectural direction: leveraging service mesh sidecar proxies as
decentralized, in-situ schedulers to enable scalable, low-latency coordination
in large-scale, cloud-native environments. We propose embedding lightweight,
autonomous scheduling logic into each sidecar, allowing scheduling decisions to
be made locally without centralized control. This approach leverages the
growing maturity of service mesh infrastructures, which support programmable
distributed traffic management. We describe the design of such an architecture
and present initial results demonstrating its scalability potential in terms of
response time and latency under varying request rates. Rather than delivering a
finalized scheduling algorithm, this paper presents a system-level
architectural direction and preliminary evidence to support its scalability
potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数十亿参数的LLM规模巨大，单一计算节点难以对其进行训练、微调或推理，因此需引入分布式计算技术来更好地利用LLM。

Method: 一是研究让LLM能在消费级电脑上运行的技术，并对现有系统进行基于元启发式的改进；二是对三种最先进的LLM服务技术进行比较研究。

Result: 文中未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) are advanced AI systems trained on extensive
textual data, leveraging deep learning techniques to understand and generate
human-like language. Today's LLMs with billions of parameters are so huge that
hardly any single computing node can train, fine-tune, or infer from them.
Therefore, several distributed computing techniques are being introduced in the
literature to properly utilize LLMs. We have explored the application of
distributed computing techniques in LLMs from two angles.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We study the techniques that democratize the LLM, that is, how large
models can be run on consumer-grade computers. Here, we also implement a novel
metaheuristics-based modification to an existing system.
  \item We perform a comparative study on three state-of-the-art LLM serving
techniques. \end{itemize}

a high-dimensional domain. In this paper, we review the performance bottlenecks

Abstract: We address the problem of computing a Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC) in

applications such as network monitoring and resource placement. We propose a
fully decentralized protocol where each node makes decisions using only local

communication-efficient, and avoids centralized coordination. We evaluate the
protocol on real-world and synthetic graphs, comparing it to both centralized
and decentralized baselines. Our results demonstrate competitive solution
quality with reduced communication overhead, highlighting the feasibility of
MWVC computation in decentralized environments.

Abstract: We introduce and address a novel distributed clustering problem where each
participant has a private dataset containing only a subset of all available
features, and some features are included in multiple datasets. This scenario
occurs in many real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where different
institutions have complementary data on similar patients. We propose two
different algorithms suitable for solving distributed clustering problems that
exhibit this type of feature space heterogeneity. The first is a federated
algorithm in which participants collaboratively update a set of global
centroids. The second is a one-shot algorithm in which participants share a
statistical parametrization of their local clusters with the central server,
who generates and merges synthetic proxy datasets. In both cases, participants
perform local clustering using algorithms of their choice, which provides
flexibility and personalized computational costs. Pretending that local
datasets result from splitting and masking an initial centralized dataset, we
identify some conditions under which the proposed algorithms are expected to
converge to the optimal centralized solution. Finally, we test the practical
performance of the algorithms on three public datasets.

Conclusion: 扩展了子模估值代理的近似结果，但 XOS 估值代理存在现有方法的障碍。

Abstract: In online combinatorial allocation, agents arrive sequentially and items are
allocated in an online manner. The algorithm designer only knows the
distribution of each agent's valuation, while the actual realization of the
valuation is revealed only upon her arrival. Against the offline benchmark,
Feldman, Gravin, and Lucier (SODA 2015) designed an optimal $0.5$-competitive
algorithm for XOS agents. An emerging line of work focuses on designing
approximation algorithms against the (computationally unbounded) optimal online
algorithm. The primary goal is to design algorithms with approximation ratios
strictly greater than $0.5$, surpassing the impossibility result against the
offline optimum. Positive results are established for unit-demand agents
(Papadimitriou, Pollner, Saberi, Wajc, MOR 2024), and for $k$-demand agents
(Braun, Kesselheim, Pollner, Saberi, EC 2024).
  In this paper, we extend the existing positive results for agents with
submodular valuations by establishing a $0.5 + \Omega(1)$ approximation against
a newly constructed online configuration LP relaxation for the combinatorial
allocation setting. Meanwhile, we provide negative results for agents with XOS
valuations by providing a $0.5$ integrality gap for the online configuration
LP, showing an obstacle of existing approaches.

Motivation: 此前工作已得出图的(h, s)-长度φ-扩张器分解规模，本文旨在给出更优规模的简单证明。

Method: 运用稀疏长度受限割集的并集仍是稀疏长度受限割集这一事实进行证明。

Result: 将(h, s)-长度φ-扩张器分解规模从log n · s n^(O(1/s)) · φ m 改进为 s n^(O(1/s)) · φ m，将取并集时稀疏性损失从log ^3 n · s^3 n^(O(1/s)) 改进为 s · n^(O(1/s))。

Conclusion: 通过简单方法证明了存在规模更优的(h, s)-长度φ-扩张器分解。

Abstract: Length-constrained expander decompositions are a new graph decomposition that
has led to several recent breakthroughs in fast graph algorithms. Roughly, an
$(h, s)$-length $\phi$-expander decomposition is a small collection of length
increases to a graph so that nodes within distance $h$ can route flow over
paths of length $hs$ while using each edge to an extent at most $1/\phi$. Prior
work showed that every $n$-node and $m$-edge graph admits an $(h, s)$-length
$\phi$-expander decomposition of size $\log n \cdot s n^{O(1/s)} \cdot \phi m$.
  In this work, we give a simple proof of the existence of $(h, s)$-length
$\phi$-expander decompositions with an improved size of $s n^{O(1/s)}\cdot \phi
m$. Our proof is a straightforward application of the fact that the union of
sparse length-constrained cuts is itself a sparse length-constrained cut. In
deriving our result, we improve the loss in sparsity when taking the union of
sparse length-constrained cuts from $\log ^3 n\cdot s^3 n^{O(1/s)}$ to $s\cdot
n^{O(1/s)}$.

Motivation: 此前没有用O(log N)比特且次常数误差的构造，需改进min - wise哈希族构造。

Method: 从组合矩形和只读分支程序的伪随机性继续和扩展对(k - )min - wise哈希族的构造研究，采用新思想调整经典Nisan - Zuckerman伪随机生成器。

Result: 给出首个用最优（常数级）随机比特数且达次常数（几乎多项式小）误差的显式k - min - wise哈希族，即O(k log N)比特和2 ^ (-O(log N / log log N))误差。

Conclusion: 在O(k log N)比特下，对任意k = log ^ O(1)N，改进了所有先前结果。

Abstract: We study explicit constructions of min-wise hash families and their extension
to $k$-min-wise hash families. Informally, a min-wise hash family guarantees
that for any fixed subset $X\subseteq[N]$, every element in $X$ has an equal
chance to have the smallest value among all elements in $X$; a $k$-min-wise
hash family guarantees this for every subset of size $k$ in $X$. Min-wise hash
is widely used in many areas of computer science such as sketching, web page
detection, and $\ell_0$ sampling.
  The classical works by Indyk and P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu and Thorup have shown
$\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$-wise independent families give min-wise hash of
multiplicative (relative) error $\delta$, resulting in a construction with
$\Theta(\log(1/\delta)\log N)$ random bits. Based on a reduction from
pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles by Saks, Srinivasan, Zhou
and Zuckerman, Gopolan and Yehudayoff improved the number of bits to $O(\log
N\log\log N)$ for polynomially small errors $\delta$. However, no construction
with $O(\log N)$ bits (polynomial size family) and sub-constant error was known
before.
  In this work, we continue and extend the study of constructing ($k$-)min-wise
hash families from pseudorandomness for combinatorial rectangles and read-once
branching programs. Our main result gives the first explicit min-wise hash
families that use an optimal (up to constant) number of random bits and achieve
a sub-constant (in fact, almost polynomially small) error, specifically, an
explicit family of $k$-min-wise hash with $O(k\log N)$ bits and $2^{-O(\log
N/\log\log N)}$ error. This improves all previous results for any
$k=\log^{O(1)}N$ under $O(k \log N)$ bits. Our main techniques involve several
new ideas to adapt the classical Nisan-Zuckerman pseudorandom generator to fool
min-wise hashing with a multiplicative error.

Method: 对该任务的高效统计查询算法进行分析。

Result: 任何高效统计查询算法完成此任务需要VSTAT复杂度至少为tilde{Ω}(d^{1/2}/α²)。

Conclusion: 高效算法对1/α的二次依赖是固有的。

Abstract: We study the task of noiseless linear regression under Gaussian covariates in
the presence of additive oblivious contamination. Specifically, we are given
i.i.d.\ samples from a distribution $(x, y)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}$ with $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}_d)$ and $y = x^\top \beta +
z$, where $z$ is drawn independently of $x$ from an unknown distribution $E$.
Moreover, $z$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}_E[z = 0] = \alpha>0$. The goal is to
accurately recover the regressor $\beta$ to small $\ell_2$-error. Ignoring
computational considerations, this problem is known to be solvable using
$O(d/\alpha)$ samples. On the other hand, the best known polynomial-time
algorithms require $\Omega(d/\alpha^2)$ samples. Here we provide formal
evidence that the quadratic dependence in $1/\alpha$ is inherent for efficient
algorithms. Specifically, we show that any efficient Statistical Query
algorithm for this task requires VSTAT complexity at least
$\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$.

Abstract: We study streaming algorithms for Correlation Clustering. Given a graph as an
arbitrary-order stream of edges, with each edge labeled as positive or
negative, the goal is to partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, such
that the number of disagreements is minimized. In this paper, we give the first
learning-augmented streaming algorithms for the problem on both complete and
general graphs, improving the best-known space-approximation tradeoffs. Based
on the works of Cambus et al. (SODA'24) and Ahn et al. (ICML'15), our
algorithms use the predictions of pairwise distances between vertices provided
by a predictor. For complete graphs, our algorithm achieves a better-than-$3$
approximation under good prediction quality, while using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total
space. For general graphs, our algorithm achieves an $O(\log |E^-|)$
approximation under good prediction quality using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space,
improving the best-known non-learning algorithm in terms of space efficiency.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed algorithms over their non-learning counterparts.

Abstract: During loading and unloading steps, energy is consumed when cranes lift
containers, while energy is often wasted when cranes drop containers. By
optimizing the scheduling of cranes, it is possible to reduce energy
consumption, thereby lowering operational costs and environmental impacts. In
this paper, we introduce a single-crane scheduling problem with energy savings,
focusing on reusing the energy from containers that have already been lifted
and reducing the total energy consumption of the entire scheduling plan. We
establish a basic model considering a one-dimensional storage area and provide
a systematic complexity analysis of the problem. First, we investigate the
connection between our problem and the semi-Eulerization problem and propose an
additive approximation algorithm. Then, we present a polynomial-time Dynamic
Programming (DP) algorithm for the case of bounded energy buffer and processing
lengths. Next, adopting a Hamiltonian perspective, we address the general case
with arbitrary energy buffer and processing lengths. We propose an exact DP
algorithm and show that the variation of the problem is polynomially solvable
when it can be transformed into a path cover problem on acyclic interval
digraphs. We introduce a paradigm that integrates both the Eulerian and
Hamiltonian perspectives, providing a robust framework for addressing the
problem.

Conclusion: 肯定回答了关于在线资源分配问题的普遍疑问，统一并推广了先前特殊情况的结果。

Abstract: Online resource allocation problems are central challenges in economics and
computer science, modeling situations in which $n$ items arriving one at a time
must each be immediately allocated among $m$ agents. In such problems, our
objective is to maximize a monotone reward function $f(\mathbf{x})$ over the
allocation vector $\mathbf{x} = (x_{ij})_{i, j}$, which describes the amount of
each item given to each agent. In settings where $f$ is concave and has
"diminishing returns" (monotone decreasing gradient), several lines of work
over the past two decades have had great success designing constant-competitive
algorithms, including the foundational work of Mehta et al. (2005) on the
Adwords problem and many follow-ups. Notably, while a greedy algorithm is
$\frac{1}{2}$-competitive in such settings, these works have shown that one can
often obtain a competitive ratio of $1-\frac{1}{e} \approx 0.632$ in a variety
of settings when items are divisible (i.e. allowing fractional allocations).
However, prior works have thus far used a variety of problem-specific
techniques, leaving open the general question: Does a
$(1-\frac{1}{e})$-competitive fractional algorithm always exist for online
resource allocation problems with concave, diminishing-returns objectives?
  In this work, we answer this question affirmatively, thereby unifying and
generalizing prior results for special cases. Our algorithm is one which makes
continuous greedy allocations with respect to an auxiliary objective
$U(\mathbf{x})$. Using the online primal-dual method, we show that if $U$
satisfies a "balanced" property with respect to $f$, then one can bound the
competitiveness of such an algorithm. Our crucial observation is that there is
a simple expression for $U$ which has this balanced property for any $f$,
yielding our general $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-competitive algorithm.

Abstract: This paper addresses the single-item capacitated lot sizing problem with a

linear equations for intermediate values. Our algorithm runs in \(O(n\log n)\)
time, where \(n\) denotes the number of periods. Our result is an improvement
over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm, which has an \(O(n^2)\) time

Abstract: Single-linkage clustering is a fundamental method for data analysis.
Algorithmically, one can compute a single-linkage $k$-clustering (a partition
into $k$ clusters) by computing a minimum spanning tree and dropping the $k-1$
most costly edges. This clustering minimizes the sum of spanning tree weights
of the clusters. This motivates us to define the cost of a single-linkage
$k$-clustering as the weight of the corresponding spanning forest, denoted by
$\mathrm{cost}_k$. Besides, if we consider single-linkage clustering as
computing a hierarchy of clusterings, the total cost of the hierarchy is
defined as the sum of the individual clusterings, denoted by $\mathrm{cost}(G)
= \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathrm{cost}_k$.
  In this paper, we assume that the distances between data points are given as
a graph $G$ with average degree $d$ and edge weights from $\{1,\dots, W\}$.
Given query access to the adjacency list of $G$, we present a sampling-based
algorithm that computes a succinct representation of estimates
$\widehat{\mathrm{cost}}_k$ for all $k$. The running time is $\tilde
O(d\sqrt{W}/\varepsilon^3)$, and the estimates satisfy $\sum_{k=1}^{n}
|\widehat{\mathrm{cost}}_k - \mathrm{cost}_k| \le \varepsilon\cdot
\mathrm{cost}(G)$, for any $0<\varepsilon <1$. Thus we can approximate the cost
of every $k$-clustering upto $(1+\varepsilon)$ factor \emph{on average}. In
particular, our result ensures that we can estimate $\cost(G)$ upto a factor of
$1\pm \varepsilon$ in the same running time.
  We also extend our results to the setting where edges represent similarities.
In this case, the clusterings are defined by a maximum spanning tree, and our
algorithms run in $\tilde{O}(dW/\varepsilon^3)$ time. We futher prove nearly
matching lower bounds for estimating the total clustering cost and we extend
our algorithms to metric space settings.

Abstract: In this work we consider the Metric Steiner Forest problem in the sublinear
time model. Given a set $V$ of $n$ points in a metric space where distances are
provided by means of query access to an $n\times n$ distance matrix, along with
a set of $k$ terminal pairs $(s_1,t_1), \dots, (s_k,t_k)\in V\times V$, the
goal is to find a minimum-weight subset of edges that connects each terminal
pair. Although sublinear time algorithms have been studied for estimating the
weight of a minimum spanning tree in both general and metric settings, as well
as for the metric Steiner Tree problem, no sublinear time algorithm was known
for the metric Steiner Forest problem.
  Here, we give an $O(\log k)$-approximation algorithm for the problem that
runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. Along the way, we provide the first
sublinear-time algorithm for estimating the size of a Maximal Independent Set
(MIS). Our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)$ under
the adjacency matrix oracle model and obtains a purely multiplicative
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation. Previously, sublinear-time algorithms for MIS
were only known for bounded-degree graphs.

Abstract: We study the sublinear space continual release model for edge-differentially
private (DP) graph algorithms, with a focus on the densest subgraph problem
(DSG) in the insertion-only setting. Our main result is the first continual
release DSG algorithm that matches the additive error of the best static DP
algorithms and the space complexity of the best non-private streaming
algorithms, up to constants. The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that
simultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection
not previously formalized in graph DP. Via a simple black-box reduction to the
static setting, we obtain both pure and approximate-DP algorithms with $O(\log
n)$ additive error and $O(n\log n)$ space, improving both accuracy and space
complexity over the previous state of the art. Along the way, we introduce
graph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier
subsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space
incurred by prior work [ELMZ25]. We believe this simple idea may be of
independent interest.

stable. Shapley and Shubik showed that every stable allocation is necessarily
built on a maximum social welfare matching. In practice, however, stable
allocations are rarely attainable, as matchings are often sub-optimal,
particularly in online settings where eagents arrive sequentially to the
market. In this paper, we introduce and compare two complementary measures of
instability for allocations with sub-optimal matchings, establish their
connections to the optimality ratio of the underlying matching, and use this
framework to study the stability performances of randomized algorithms in
online assignment games.

TL;DR: 本文研究带权重的不可分任务分配问题，在保证公平和效率前提下，给出多项式时间算法，达相同补贴上限且确保帕累托最优，算法及分析更简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wu和Zhou方法虽保证公平但不保证经济效率且技术复杂，需新方法解决带权重的不可分任务分配问题，兼顾公平与效率。

Method: 先计算比例公平的竞争均衡，再应用由最小单位成本边引导的舍入程序。

Result: 给出多项式时间算法，达到与Wu和Zhou相同补贴上限$n/3 - 1/6$，并确保帕累托最优。

Conclusion: 新算法可解决带权重的不可分任务分配问题，兼顾公平与效率，且算法及分析比Wu和Zhou的更简单。

Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating $m$ indivisible chores among $n$ agents
with possibly different weights, aiming for a solution that is both fair and
efficient. Specifically, we focus on the classic fairness notion of
proportionality and efficiency notion of Pareto-optimality. Since proportional
allocations may not always exist in this setting, we allow the use of subsidies
(monetary compensation to agents) to ensure agents are
proportionally-satisfied, and aim to minimize the total subsidy required. Wu
and Zhou (WINE 2024) showed that when each chore has disutility at most 1, a
total subsidy of at most $n/3 - 1/6$ is sufficient to guarantee
proportionality. However, their approach is based on a complex technique, which
does not guarantee economic efficiency - a key desideratum in fair division.
  In this work, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the same
subsidy bound while also ensuring Pareto-optimality. Moreover, both our
algorithm and its analysis are significantly simpler than those of Wu and Zhou
(WINE 2024). Our approach first computes a proportionally-fair competitive
equilibrium, and then applies a rounding procedure guided by
minimum-pain-per-buck edges.

Motivation: 近年来在不同估值类别下改进MMS近似保证有显著进展，但当前算法的近似保证与理论上限存在差距，需缩小该差距。

Method: 未提及

Result: 将已知的MMS近似保证从3/4 + 3/3836提高到10/13。

Conclusion: 成功缩小了MMS近似保证的差距，得到了更好的近似保证。

Abstract: The maximin share ($\textsf{MMS}$) is the most prominent share-based fairness
notion in the fair allocation of indivisible goods. Recent years have seen
significant efforts to improve the approximation guarantees for $\textsf{MMS}$
for different valuation classes, particularly for additive valuations. For the
additive setting, it has been shown that for some instances, no allocation can
guarantee a factor better than $1-\tfrac{1}{n^4}$ of maximin share value to all
agents. However, the best currently known algorithm achieves an approximation
guarantee of $\tfrac{3}{4} + \tfrac{3}{3836}$ for $\textsf{MMS}$. In this work,
we narrow this gap and improve the best-known approximation guarantee for
$\textsf{MMS}$ to $\tfrac{10}{13}$.

Result: 将不可分割杂务分配的上界从O(log n)-WMMS提升至常数-WMMS保证（证明存在20-WMMS分配）。

Conclusion: 本文方法有提升上界的效果，若更严谨分析可能有更好结果。

Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning indivisible chores to agents with
different entitlements in the maximin share value (\MMS) context. While
constant-\MMS\ allocations/assignments are guaranteed to exist for both goods
and chores in the symmetric setting, the situation becomes much more complex
when agents have different entitlements. For the allocation of indivisible
goods, it has been proven that an $n$-\WMMS\ (weighted \MMS) guarantee is the
best one can hope for. For indivisible chores, however, it was recently
discovered that an $O(\log n)$-\WMMS\ assignment is guaranteed to exist. In
this work, we improve this upper bound to a constant-\WMMS\
guarantee.\footnote{We prove the existence of a 20-\WMMS\ assignment, but we
did not attempt to optimize the constant factor. We believe our methods already
yield a slightly better bound with a tighter analysis.}

Motivation: 设计成本分配规则，在考虑零售商自主选择补货间隔以最小化自身成本的情况下，最小化长期平均系统成本。

Method: 引入按预定义权重分配主要设置成本的成本分配规则，利用规则的单调性证明支付占优纯纳什均衡的存在，通过考察价格稳定性分析均衡效率。

Result: 证明存在可有效计算的支付占优纯纳什均衡，一种利用零售商持有成本率的规则实现接近最优的价格稳定性1.25，另一种无需私有信息的规则也有良好价格稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的成本分配规则在不同信息设置下能实现较好的系统成本和价格稳定性。

Abstract: We analyze an infinite-horizon deterministic joint replenishment model from a
non-cooperative game-theoretical approach. In this model, a group of retailers
can choose to jointly place an order, which incurs a major setup cost
independent of the group, and a minor setup cost for each retailer.
Additionally, each retailer is associated with a holding cost. Our objective is
to design cost allocation rules that minimize the long-run average system cost
while accounting for the fact that each retailer independently selects its
replenishment interval to minimize its own cost. We introduce a class of cost
allocation rules that distribute the major setup cost among the associated
retailers in proportion to their predefined weights. For these rules, we
establish a monotonicity property of agent better responses, which enables us
to prove the existence of a payoff dominant pure Nash equilibrium that can also
be computed efficiently. We then analyze the efficiency of these equilibria by
examining the price of stability (PoS), the ratio of the best Nash
equilibrium's system cost to the social optimum, across different information
settings. In particular, our analysis reveals that one rule, which leverages
retailers' own holding cost rates, achieves a near-optimal PoS of 1.25, while
another rule that does not require access to retailers' private information
also yields a favorable PoS.

Method: 提出双时间尺度模型，顶点间通信在快时间尺度，企业策略更新在慢时间尺度。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计竞赛成功函数，可以使纳什均衡唯一并实现社会福利最大化。

Abstract: Firms (businesses, service providers, entertainment organizations, political
parties, etc.) advertise on social networks to draw people's attention and
improve their awareness of the brands of the firms. In all such cases, the
competitive nature of their engagements gives rise to a game where the firms
need to decide how to distribute their budget over the agents on a network to
maximize their brand's awareness. The firms (players) therefore need to
optimize how much budget they should put on the vertices of the network so that
the spread improves via direct (via advertisements or free promotional offers)
and indirect marketing (words-of-mouth). We propose a two-timescale model of
decisions where the communication between the vertices happen in a faster
timescale and the strategy update of the firms happen in a slower timescale. We
show that under fairly standard conditions, the best response dynamics of the
firms converge to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. However, such equilibria
can be away from a socially optimal one. We provide a characterization of the
contest success functions and provide examples for the designers of such
contests (e.g., regulators, social network providers, etc.) such that the Nash
equilibrium becomes unique and social welfare maximizing. Our experiments show
that for realistic scenarios, such contest success functions perform fairly
well.

<details>

Motivation: 经典合作博弈理论中联盟价值仅取决于参与主体集合，实际还可能与主体到达顺序有关，因此引入TCG。

Method: 定义I4OA、OIR和SE三个属性，构建顺序和扩展世界的Shapley类似物。

Result: 确定了由三个属性唯一表征的奖励分配机制类，Shapley类似物与满足三个属性的机制不相交。

Conclusion: 玩家顺序到达时，满足理想时间属性的奖励分配机制与Shapley机制有根本冲突，为TCG中定义公平有效解决方案提出新问题。

Abstract: Classical cooperative game theory assumes that the worth of a coalition
depends only on the set of agents involved, but in practice, it may also depend
on the order in which agents arrive. Motivated by such scenarios, we introduce
temporal cooperative games (TCG), where the worth $v$ becomes a function of the
sequence of agents $\pi$ rather than just the set $S$. This shift calls for
rethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is
the incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in
the order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional
properties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents
to invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the
total worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify
a class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three
properties. The classical Shapley value does not directly apply here, so we
construct its natural analogs in two variants: the sequential world, where
rewards are defined for each sequence-player pair, and the extended world,
where rewards are defined for each player alone. Properties of efficiency,
additivity, and null player uniquely determine these Shapley analogs in both
worlds. Importantly, the Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms
satisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, and this conflict persists even for restricted
classes such as convex and simple TCGs. Our findings thus uncover a fundamental
tension: when players arrive sequentially, reward-sharing mechanisms satisfying
desirable temporal properties must inherently differ from Shapley-inspired
ones, opening new questions for defining fair and efficient solution concepts
in TCGs.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing stationary Nash equilibria in discounted
perfect information stochastic games from the viewpoint of computational
complexity. For two-player games we prove the problem to be in PPAD, which
together with a previous PPAD-hardness result precisely classifies the problem
as PPAD-complete. In addition to this we give an improved and simpler
PPAD-hardness proof for computing a stationary epsilon-Nash equilibrium. For
3-player games we construct games showing that rational-valued stationary Nash
equilibria are not guaranteed to exist, and we use these to prove
SqrtSum-hardness of computing a stationary Nash equilibrium in 4-player games.

Abstract: In multiwinner approval elections with many candidates, voters may struggle
to determine their preferences over the entire slate of candidates. It is
therefore of interest to explore which (if any) fairness guarantees can be
provided under reduced communication. In this paper, we consider voters with
one-dimensional preferences: voters and candidates are associated with points
in $\mathbb R$, and each voter's approval set forms an interval of $\mathbb R$.
We put forward a probabilistic preference model, where the voter set consists
of $\sigma$ different groups; each group is associated with a distribution over
an interval of $\mathbb R$, so that each voter draws the endpoints of her
approval interval from the distribution associated with her group. We present
an algorithm for computing committees that provide Proportional Justified
Representation + (PJR+), which proceeds by querying voters' preferences, and
show that, in expectation, it makes $\mathcal{O}(\log( \sigma\cdot k))$ queries
per voter, where $k$ is the desired committee size.

Motivation: 级联广告推荐系统的轻量级排名器需进行联合整体优化以最大化平台、广告商和用户价值，但现有基于DNN的多任务学习难以统一不同展示面和广告产品的数据，需学习特定领域知识并在领域间转移知识。

Method: 提出基于经典双塔范式的Multi - Task Multi - Domain (MTMD) 架构，包括统一处理不同任务、产品和展示面，用混合专家架构学习特定和通用知识，提出领域自适应模块促进知识转移，约束不同预测任务建模。

Result: MTMD使离线损失值改善12% - 36%，在线每次点击成本降低2%，已部署到Pinterest广告推荐生产环境，取代9个生产模型。

Conclusion: MTMD架构能有效解决轻量级排名器的多任务多领域联合优化问题，提升广告推荐效果，可用于实际生产。

Abstract: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before
the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad
recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization
tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads
and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces
where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with
diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging
problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight
ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's
value are maximized.
  Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple
goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization
goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different
surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn
domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains
to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture
under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1)
handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a
unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn
both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between
domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer
between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD
improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction
in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production
for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.

Motivation: 现有密集检索方法难捕捉细粒度科学概念，基于大模型的方法忽略概念多面性。

Method: 提出Pairwise Semantic Matching (PairSem)框架，将相关语义表示为实体 - 方面对。

Result: 在多个数据集和检索器上的大量实验表明，PairSem显著提高了检索性能。

Conclusion: 在科学信息检索中对多方面语义进行建模很重要。

Abstract: Scientific document retrieval is a critical task for enabling knowledge
discovery and supporting research across diverse domains. However, existing
dense retrieval methods often struggle to capture fine-grained scientific
concepts in texts due to their reliance on holistic embeddings and limited
domain understanding. Recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs)
to extract fine-grained semantic entities and enhance semantic matching, but
they typically treat entities as independent fragments, overlooking the
multi-faceted nature of scientific concepts. To address this limitation, we
propose Pairwise Semantic Matching (PairSem), a framework that represents
relevant semantics as entity-aspect pairs, capturing complex, multi-faceted
scientific concepts. PairSem is unsupervised, base retriever-agnostic, and
plug-and-play, enabling precise and context-aware matching without requiring
query-document labels or entity annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets and retrievers demonstrate that PairSem significantly improves
retrieval performance, highlighting the importance of modeling multi-aspect
semantics in scientific information retrieval.

Motivation: 短视频平台长尾查询存在问题，现有LLM在该场景表现不佳，需改进查询改写。

Method: 引入CardRewriter框架，聚合多源知识生成知识卡片引导LLM，采用两阶段训练优化。

Result: 离线实验提升改写质量，在线A/B测试提高LVR和CTR，降低IQRR。

Conclusion: CardRewriter有效改善短视频平台长尾查询改写，已成功部署服务大量用户。

Abstract: Short-video platforms have rapidly become a new generation of information
retrieval systems, where users formulate queries to access desired videos.
However, user queries, especially long-tail ones, often suffer from spelling
errors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, resulting in mismatches
between user expectations and retrieved results. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown success in long-tail query rewriting within e-commerce, they
struggle on short-video platforms, where proprietary content such as short
videos, live streams, micro dramas, and user social networks falls outside
their training distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce
\textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific
knowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method
aggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into
an informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM
to better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We
optimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored
reward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline
experiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for
queries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing further confirms
significant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), along
with a notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR). Since
September 2025, CardRewriter has been deployed on Kuaishou, one of China's
largest short-video platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

Conclusion: 结构感知注意力机制在知识图谱增强推荐中有效且实用。

Abstract: This paper designs and implements an explainable recommendation model that
integrates knowledge graphs with structure-aware attention mechanisms. The
model is built on graph neural networks and incorporates a multi-hop neighbor
aggregation strategy. By integrating the structural information of knowledge
graphs and dynamically assigning importance to different neighbors through an
attention mechanism, the model enhances its ability to capture implicit
preference relationships. In the proposed method, users and items are embedded
into a unified graph structure. Multi-level semantic paths are constructed
based on entities and relations in the knowledge graph to extract richer
contextual information. During the rating prediction phase, recommendations are
generated through the interaction between user and target item representations.
The model is optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function. Experiments
conducted on the Amazon Books dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed model across various evaluation metrics. The model also shows good
convergence and stability. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness
and practicality of structure-aware attention mechanisms in knowledge
graph-enhanced recommendation.

Abstract: Reranking, as the final stage of recommender systems, demands real-time
inference, accuracy, and diversity. It plays a crucial role in determining the
final exposure, directly influencing user experience. Recently, generative
reranking has gained increasing attention for its strong ability to model
complex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from
the "likelihood trap", where high-likelihood sequences are often perceived as
low-quality by humans. These models tend to repeatedly recommend a set of
high-frequency items, resulting in list homogeneity, thereby limiting user
engagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative
Recommendation (Congrats), a novel generative reranking framework. To break the
likelihood trap, we introduce a novel graph-structured decoder that can capture
diverse sequences along multiple paths. This design not only expands the
decoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by
implicit item dependencies derived from vertex transitions. Furthermore, we
design a differentiable cascade system that incorporates an evaluator, enabling
the model to learn directly from user preferences as the training objective.
Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of Congrats
over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Moreover, Congrats has been evaluated
on a large-scale video-sharing app, Kuaishou, with over 300 million daily
active users, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves both
recommendation quality and diversity, validating our effectiveness in practical
industrial environments.

Conclusion: ZeroGR能有效解决生成式检索零样本泛化问题，为指令驱动GR建立新的最优水平。

Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) reformulates information retrieval (IR) by framing
it as the generation of document identifiers (docids), thereby enabling an
end-to-end optimization and seamless integration with generative language
models (LMs). Despite notable progress under supervised training, GR still
struggles to generalize to zero-shot IR scenarios, which are prevalent in
real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose \textsc{ZeroGR},
a zero-shot generative retrieval framework that leverages natural language
instructions to extend GR across a wide range of IR tasks. Specifically,
\textsc{ZeroGR} is composed of three key components: (i) an LM-based docid
generator that unifies heterogeneous documents (e.g., text, tables, code) into
semantically meaningful docids; (ii) an instruction-tuned query generator that
generates diverse types of queries from natural language task descriptions to
enhance corpus indexing; and (iii) a reverse annealing decoding strategy to
balance precision and recall during docid generation. We investigate the impact
of instruction fine-tuning scale and find that performance consistently
improves as the number of IR tasks encountered during training increases.
Empirical results on the BEIR and MAIR benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{ZeroGR} outperforms strong dense retrieval and generative baselines in
zero-shot settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art for instruction-driven
GR.

collaborative filtering. When implemented on implicit feedback data (such as
clicks), a common heuristic is to upweight the observed interactions. This
strategy has been shown to improve performance for certain algorithms. In this
paper, we conduct a systematic study of various weighting schemes and matrix
factorization algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that training with
unweighted data can perform comparably to, and sometimes outperform, training
with weighted data, especially for large models. This observation challenges
the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, we identify cases where weighting can be
beneficial, particularly for models with lower capacity and specific
regularization schemes. We also derive efficient algorithms for exactly
minimizing several weighted objectives that were previously considered
computationally intractable. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the
interplay between weighting, regularization, and model capacity in matrix
factorization for recommender systems.

Motivation: 现有重新排序算法在引导创作者行为时与短期推荐精度目标冲突，需要新方法提升长期用户福利。

Result: 在两个真实世界推荐系统数据集上的实验表明，该方法在改善长期用户福利方面优于现有公平重新排序方法和信息揭示策略。

Conclusion: 所提信息揭示框架能有效提升推荐系统中长期用户福利。

Abstract: Improving the long-term user welfare (e.g., sustained user engagement) has
become a central objective of recommender systems (RS). In real-world
platforms, the creation behaviors of content creators plays a crucial role in
shaping long-term welfare beyond short-term recommendation accuracy, making the
effective steering of creator behavior essential to foster a healthier RS
ecosystem. Existing works typically rely on re-ranking algorithms that
heuristically adjust item exposure to steer creators' behavior. However, when
embedded within recommendation pipelines, such a strategy often conflicts with
the short-term objective of improving recommendation accuracy, leading to
performance degradation and suboptimal long-term welfare. The well-established
economics studies offer us valuable insights for an alternative approach
without relying on recommendation algorithmic design: revealing information
from an information-rich party (sender) to a less-informed party (receiver) can
effectively change the receiver's beliefs and steer their behavior. Inspired by
this idea, we propose an information-revealing framework, named Long-term
Welfare Optimization via Information Revelation (LoRe). In this framework, we
utilize a classical information revelation method (i.e., Bayesian persuasion)
to map the stakeholders in RS, treating the platform as the sender and creators
as the receivers. To address the challenge posed by the unrealistic assumption
of traditional economic methods, we formulate the process of information
revelation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a learning algorithm
trained and inferred in environments with boundedly rational creators.
Extensive experiments on two real-world RS datasets demonstrate that our method
can effectively outperform existing fair re-ranking methods and information
revealing strategies in improving long-term user welfare.

Motivation: 现有基于历史交互物品ID的序列推荐模型在交互历史有限时性能不佳，基于内容的序列推荐存在语义差距、联合建模用户偏好和对齐ID与内容表示的挑战。

Method: 提出LLM驱动的样本构建方法和监督微调方法对齐物品级模态表示；设计基于Transformer的序列模型，分别编码用户行为偏好和内容偏好，通过混合模态解码器掌握两者关系；提出两步训练策略和内容感知对比学习任务对齐模态和ID表示。

Result: 在四个公共视频流数据集上，SICSRec在NDCG@5上平均比现有ID模态和内容模态序列推荐器高8.04%，在NDCG@10上高6.62%。

Conclusion: SICSRec模型有效解决了基于内容的序列推荐的挑战，性能表现优异。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) models often capture user preferences based on
the historically interacted item IDs, which usually obtain sub-optimal
performance when the interaction history is limited. Content-based sequential
recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits
items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However,
there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap
between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model
user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an
effective training strategy to align ID representations and content
representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model,
self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment,
named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and
develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality
representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential
model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior
preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content
preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic
relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a
two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to
align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the
training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative
dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming
datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality
sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04%
on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，所提方法显著优于现有序列推荐和去噪模型。

Conclusion: MGSD - WSS能有效解决现有序列推荐去噪问题，提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user
interests in historical interaction sequences. Historical interaction sequences
often contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the
performance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised
methods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by
predicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise
labels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise.
Additionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise
driven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise,
limiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To
address these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with
Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS
first introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the
original and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes
weakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical
interaction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising
module with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item
representations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the
ground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain
denoised interest representations. Finally, based on the denoised item and
interest representations, MGSD-WSS predicts the next item. Extensive
experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art sequence recommendation and denoising models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lalunex/MGSD-WSS.

Conclusion: VeritasFi为通用和公司特定的问答任务提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming increasingly essential for
Question Answering (QA) in the financial sector, where accurate and
contextually grounded insights from complex public disclosures are crucial.
However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1)
they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and
figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain
applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges,
we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a
multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training
strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through
three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly
transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A
tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep
multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time
data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank
for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and
efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which
initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data,
followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted
applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a
groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness
of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain
and company-specific QA tasks. Code accompanying this work is available at

Conclusion: CoCountER方法能有效解决现有可解释推荐方法的问题。

Abstract: Explainable recommendation through counterfactual reasoning seeks to identify
the influential aspects of items in recommendations, which can then be used as
explanations. However, state-of-the-art approaches, which aim to minimize
changes in product aspects while reversing their recommended decisions
according to an aggregated decision boundary score, often lead to factual
inaccuracies in explanations. To solve this problem, in this work we propose a
novel method of Comparative Counterfactual Explanations for Recommendation
(CoCountER). CoCountER creates counterfactual data based on soft swap
operations, enabling explanations for recommendations of arbitrary pairs of
comparative items. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，HatLLM比现有基于大语言模型的方法平均有9.13%的性能提升。

Conclusion: HatLLM策略能让大语言模型同时建模标记级和项目级依赖，有效提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge of research on leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for sequential recommendation. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable
potential in inferring users' nuanced preferences through fine-grained semantic
reasoning. However, they also exhibit a notable limitation in effectively
modeling collaborative signals, i.e., behavioral correlations inherent in
users' historical interactions. Our empirical analysis further reveals that the
attention mechanisms in LLMs tend to disproportionately focus on tokens within
the same item, thereby impeding the capture of cross-item correlations.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical attention masking
strategy for LLM-based recommendation, termed HatLLM. Specifically, in shallow
layers, HatLLM masks attention between tokens from different items,
facilitating intra-item semantic understanding; in contrast, in deep layers,
HatLLM masks attention within items, thereby compelling the model to capture
cross-item correlations. This progressive, layer-wise approach enables LLMs to
jointly model both token-level and item-level dependencies. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HatLLM achieves
significant performance gains (9.13% on average) over existing LLM-based
methods.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，GDRT有效缓解语言偏差，平均NDCG@10提高24.29%，显著提升推荐公平性。

Conclusion: GDRT能有效缓解语言偏差，提升推荐准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge
and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into
recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the
pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation
tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed
on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their
predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it
induces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such
as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user
interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only
undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns.
  To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust
Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces
consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of
relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming
groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts
the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user
interaction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments
conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates
language bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy
(with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing
recommendation fairness.

Conclusion: 框架有效且有实用价值。

Abstract: Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict
latency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning
distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful
teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first
stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a
domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process:
domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised
fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a
multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and
preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically
annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance
labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of
architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive
Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same
student model under "standard" and "reasoning-augmented" inputs as a
teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize
the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit
reasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the
Meituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves
significant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness
and practical value.

Conclusion: DMF能有效实现多模态融合，提升推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance
by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based
Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches
typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and
multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained
interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper,
we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a
modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between
ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user
interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge
the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side
information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling.
Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that
decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings
before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck
introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive
multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned
under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline
experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of
the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements
of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: HoMer模型具有优越性和实用性，无需大幅修改预测流程。

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and
non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer
user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods
face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i)
Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less
granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features,
thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity
arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items,
yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the
entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented
integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle
the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for
modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side
features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and
fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm
from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly
parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves
dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model
size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer
successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the
AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%.
Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering
optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.

Conclusion: DyKnow - RAG是首批用于电商相关性的单遍RAG解决方案，能将噪声外部信号转化为可靠收益且不增加在线复杂性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling query-item relevance drives e-commerce ranking, yet
long-tail, knowledge-heavy, and fast-evolving queries exceed parametric LLM
coverage. External context (reviews, attribute encyclopedias, UGC) can help but
is noisy, and single-pass latency and cost forbid any clean-then-summarize
step. The model must, per query, judge relevance and decide whether to use,
partially use, or ignore the context. DyKnow-RAG is a dynamic noisy-RAG
framework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It trains two rollout
groups (no external context vs a single retrieved chunk) and applies
posterior-driven inter-group advantage scaling that adaptively reweights their
contributions by the per-query correctness gap. This teaches when to trust
retrieval versus fall back to parametric knowledge, without process labels,
value networks, or extra inference passes, preserving single-pass, single-chunk
deployment under production latency. Training combines: (1) supervised
initialization with a structured rationale that explicitly records the
context-usage decision; (2) an RL pool prioritized by SFT uncertainty to focus
where context choice is most consequential; and (3) an optional lightweight DPO
warm start to stabilize with-context calibration. Under a unified
retrieval/index and fixed latency budget, DyKnow-RAG outperforms SFT, DPO, and
vanilla GRPO in offline tests, and delivers consistent lifts on GSB, Query
Goodrate, and Item Goodrate in Taobao A/B testing. It is deployed in Taobao's
production relevance system, serving live traffic. To our knowledge, it is
among the first single-pass RAG solutions for e-commerce relevance, turning
noisy external signals into reliable gains without added online complexity.

Result: 离线实验显示AMEN优于基线模型，在线A/B测试表明其对关键业务指标有显著提升。

Conclusion: AMEN框架有效解决现有CTR预测方法局限，在实际应用中有显著效果。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a cornerstone of modern recommender
systems, has been dominated by discriminative models that react to past user
behavior rather than proactively modeling user intent. Existing generative
paradigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large
Language Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing
e-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is
constrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model
learns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing
a user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest
Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both
rich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical
objective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve
this via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages
through cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment
Module for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative
model with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture
temporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network
(AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline. Extensive offline
experiments validate AMEN's superiority over strong baselines, and a
large-scale online A/B test demonstrates its significant real-world impact,
delivering substantial improvements in key business metrics.

Abstract: In recent years, affiliate marketing has emerged as a revenue-sharing
strategy where merchants collaborate with promoters to promote their products.
It not only increases product exposure but also allows promoters to earn a
commission. This paper addresses the pivotal yet under-explored challenge in
affiliate marketing: accurately assessing and predicting the contributions of
promoters in product promotion. We design a novel metric for evaluating the
indirect contributions of the promoter, called propagation scale.
Unfortunately, existing time series forecasting techniques fail to deliver
accurate predictions due to the propagation scale being influenced by multiple
factors and the inherent complexities arising from dynamic scenarios. To
address this issue, we decouple the network structure from the node signals and
propose a two-stage solution: initially, the basic self-sales and network
structure prediction are conducted separately, followed by the synthesis of the
propagation scale. Specifically, we design a graph convolution encoding scheme
based on descendant neighbors and incorporate hypergraph convolution to
efficiently capture complex promotional dynamics. Additionally, three auxiliary
tasks are employed: self-sales prediction for base estimations, descendant
prediction to synthesize propagation scale, and promoter activation prediction
to mitigate high volatility issues. Extensive offline experiments on

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial approach for
enhancing the responses of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge
sources. Despite the impressive performance in complex question-answering
tasks, RAG still struggles with hallucinations. Attributing RAG-generated
content through in-line citations has demonstrated potential in reducing
hallucinations and facilitating human verification. Existing citation
generation methods primarily rely on either fine-tuning the generator or
employing post-processing approaches for citation matching. However, the former
approach demands substantial annotated data and computational resources, while
the latter often encounters difficulties in managing multiple citations and
frequently produces suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework, called VeriCite, designed to rigorously validate supporting evidence
and enhance answer attribution. Specifically, VeriCite breaks down into a
three-stage generation: 1) The initial answer generation first generates a
response based on all available contexts and has its claims verified through
the NLI model; 2) the supporting evidence selection assesses the utility of
each document and extracts useful supporting evidences; 3) the final answer
refinement integrates the initial response and collected evidences to produce
the final, refined answer.We conduct experiments across five open-source LLMs
and four datasets, demonstrating that VeriCite can significantly improve
citation quality while maintaining the correctness of the answers.

Motivation: 冷启动推荐系统在训练时可能继承协同过滤模型的预测偏差，解决推荐系统不公平问题。

Method: 在三个多媒体数据集上分析三种生成式冷启动方法的偏差影响，提出基于嵌入幅度的后处理偏差缓解方法。

Result: 冷启动推荐器不仅会复制热门偏差，且受影响更严重，后处理方法可在有限影响用户冷启动准确性的情况下产生更平衡的推荐。

Conclusion: 后处理偏差缓解方法能在不严重损害用户冷启动准确性的前提下，减少推荐系统的热门偏差，使推荐更平衡。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems struggle with making
predictions on unseen, or 'cold', items. Systems designed to address this
challenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to
leverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction
data. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods,
cold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases.
In this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a
common cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to
more popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting
rarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the
popularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely:
because they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead
attempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to
significant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to
popular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through
experiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this
behavior on three generative cold-start methods. We then describe a simple
post-processing bias mitigation method that, by using embedding magnitude as a
proxy for predicted popularity, can produce more balanced recommendations with
limited harm to user-oriented cold-start accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文介绍AutoGEO框架，可自动学习生成式引擎偏好并改写网页内容，实验证明其有效且代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式引擎快速发展，内容提供者有生成式引擎优化（GEO）需求。

Method: AutoGEO先让前沿大语言模型解释生成式引擎偏好并提取规则，再将规则用于AutoGEO$_	ext{API}$和训练AutoGEO$_	ext{Mini}$。

Result: 在标准GEO - Bench和两个新构建基准上的实验表明AutoGEO能增强内容吸引力并保留搜索实用性。

Conclusion: AutoGEO学习的规则具有鲁棒性，能捕捉不同领域偏好，可用于内容优化。

Abstract: By employing large language models (LLMs) to retrieve documents and generate
natural language responses, Generative Engines, such as Google AI overview and
ChatGPT, provide significantly enhanced user experiences and have rapidly
become the new form of search. Their rapid adoption also drives the needs of
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), as content providers are eager to gain
more traction from them. In this paper, we introduce AutoGEO, a framework to
automatically learn generative engine preferences when using retrieved contents
for response generation, and rewrite web contents for more such traction.
AutoGEO first prompts frontier LLMs to explain generative engine preferences
and extract meaningful preference rules from these explanations. Then it uses
preference rules as context engineering for AutoGEO$_\text{API}$, a
prompt-based GEO system, and as rule-based rewards to train
AutoGEO$_\text{Mini}$, a cost-effective GEO model. Experiments on the standard
GEO-Bench and two newly constructed benchmarks using real user queries
demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoGEO in enhancing content traction while
preserving search utility. Analyses confirm the learned rules' robustness and
abilities to capture unique preferences in variant domains, and AutoGEO
systems' ability to embed them in content optimization. The code is released at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoGEO.

TL;DR: 本文提出用于检索增强推理（RAR）的不确定性量化（UQ）新方法R2C，通过实验表明其优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAR易出错和产生误导输出，现有UQ方法无法妥善处理RAR场景，需要考虑所有不确定性来源来准确估计RAR的UQ。

Method: 提出R2C方法，通过对多步推理过程进行扰动，利用迭代反馈循环捕捉检索和生成组件的不确定性。

Result: 在五个流行RAR系统和不同QA数据集上，R2C平均使AUROC提升超5%；在两个下游任务中也表现出色，如在弃权任务中F1Abstain和AccAbstain提升约5%，在模型选择任务中精确匹配率提升约7%（对比单模型）和约3%（对比选择方法）。

Conclusion: R2C是一种有效的RAR的UQ方法，在多个实验和下游任务中表现优于现有基线。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAR) is a recent evolution of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that employs multiple reasoning steps for
retrieval and generation. While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains
vulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
offers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,
however, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step
retrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for
RAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising
from retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources
and introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ
method for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning
process by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations
alter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies
the generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,
the retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling
us to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five
popular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by
over 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines. Extrinsic
evaluations using R2C as an external signal further confirm its effectiveness
for two downstream tasks: in Abstention, it achieves ~5% gains in both
F1Abstain and AccAbstain; in Model Selection, it improves the exact match by
~7% over single models and ~3% over selection methods.

Motivation: 探究生成式搜索输出与传统网络搜索在哪些维度存在差异。

Method: 对比Google传统搜索引擎与来自两个供应商（Google和OpenAI）的四个生成式搜索引擎在四个领域的查询结果。

Result: 多数生成式搜索引擎比网络搜索涵盖更广泛的信息源；在依赖模型内部知识和外部网络知识的程度上有差异；展现不同的概念集。

Conclusion: 在生成式AI时代需要重新审视网络搜索的评估标准。

Abstract: The advent of LLMs has given rise to a new type of web search: Generative
search, where LLMs retrieve web pages related to a query and generate a single,
coherent text as a response. This output modality stands in stark contrast to
traditional web search, where results are returned as a ranked list of
independent web pages. In this paper, we ask: Along what dimensions do
generative search outputs differ from traditional web search? We compare
Google, a traditional web search engine, with four generative search engines
from two providers (Google and OpenAI) across queries from four domains. Our
analysis reveals intriguing differences. Most generative search engines cover a
wider range of sources compared to web search. Generative search engines vary
in the degree to which they rely on internal knowledge contained within the
model parameters v.s. external knowledge retrieved from the web. Generative
search engines surface varying sets of concepts, creating new opportunities for
enhancing search diversity and serendipity. Our results also highlight the need
for revisiting evaluation criteria for web search in the age of Generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将利用知识图谱的实体导向方法和捕捉细粒度语义的多向量模型方法进行统一。

Method: 引入QDER模型，在排序过程中保持单个标记和实体表示，在最终评分阶段进行聚合，即“晚聚合”，通过学习的注意力模式转换细粒度表示并进行精确匹配的数学运算。

Result: 在五个标准基准测试中取得显著性能提升，如在TREC Robust 2004上nDCG@20比最强基线提高36%，在困难查询上表现出色。

Conclusion: 为实体感知检索的未来工作奠定基础。

Abstract: Neural IR has advanced through two distinct paths: entity-oriented approaches
leveraging knowledge graphs and multi-vector models capturing fine-grained
semantics. We introduce QDER, a neural re-ranking model that unifies these
approaches by integrating knowledge graph semantics into a multi-vector model.
QDER's key innovation lies in its modeling of query-document relationships:
rather than computing similarity scores on aggregated embeddings, we maintain
individual token and entity representations throughout the ranking process,
performing aggregation only at the final scoring stage - an approach we call
"late aggregation." We first transform these fine-grained representations
through learned attention patterns, then apply carefully chosen mathematical
operations for precise matches. Experiments across five standard benchmarks
show that QDER achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of 36%
in nDCG@20 over the strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004 and similar
improvements on other datasets. QDER particularly excels on difficult queries,
achieving an nDCG@20 of 0.70 where traditional approaches fail completely
(nDCG@20 = 0.0), setting a foundation for future work in entity-aware
retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经重排器难以处理复杂信息需求和长文档，关键问题是智能内容选择。

Method: 引入REGENT模型，将相关性引导融入注意力机制，结合细粒度词汇匹配和高级语义推理。

Result: REGENT在三个具有挑战性的数据集上达到新的最优性能，比BM25最多提升108%，且始终优于ColBERT和RankVicuna等强基线。

Conclusion: 这是首次将实体语义直接集成到神经注意力中的工作，为实体感知信息检索建立了新范式。

Abstract: Current neural re-rankers often struggle with complex information needs and
long, content-rich documents. The fundamental issue is not computational--it is
intelligent content selection: identifying what matters in lengthy,
multi-faceted texts. While humans naturally anchor their understanding around
key entities and concepts, neural models process text within rigid token
windows, treating all interactions as equally important and missing critical
semantic signals. We introduce REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that mimics
human-like understanding by using entities as a "semantic skeleton" to guide
attention. REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into the attention
mechanism, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic
reasoning. This relevance-guided attention enables the model to focus on
conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term
matches. REGENT achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging
datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently
outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to successfully integrate entity semantics
directly into neural attention, establishing a new paradigm for entity-aware
information retrieval.

Method: 提出OneRec - Think框架，包含Itemic Alignment、Reasoning Activation和Reasoning Enhancement。

Result: 在公共基准测试中表现达到最优，在快手部署使APP停留时间提升0.159%。

Conclusion: OneRec - Think框架有效，其显式推理能力具有实际效用。

Abstract: The powerful generative capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
instigated a paradigm shift in recommendation. However, existing generative
models (e.g., OneRec) operate as implicit predictors, critically lacking the
capacity for explicit and controllable reasoning-a key advantage of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose OneRec-Think, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates dialogue, reasoning, and personalized recommendation. OneRec-Think
incorporates: (1) Itemic Alignment: cross-modal Item-Textual Alignment for
semantic grounding; (2) Reasoning Activation: Reasoning Scaffolding to activate
LLM reasoning within the recommendation context; and (3) Reasoning Enhancement,
where we design a recommendation-specific reward function that accounts for the
multi-validity nature of user preferences. Experiments across public benchmarks
show state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our proposed "Think-Ahead"
architecture enables effective industrial deployment on Kuaishou, achieving a
0.159\% gain in APP Stay Time and validating the practical efficacy of the
model's explicit reasoning capability.

Result: 在FinFact数据集上实验，FinVet的F1分数达0.85，比最佳单管道提升10.4%，比独立RAG方法提升37%。

Conclusion: FinVet能提供有证据的判断、来源归因、置信分数和不确定性标记，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger
billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in
their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We
introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking
through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive
three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on
retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to
full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides
evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit
uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the
FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a
10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and
37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

Motivation: 多任务学习存在负迁移和跷跷板现象，复杂任务相关性给MTL模型带来挑战，需利用个性化信息解决问题。

Method: 提出DRGrad框架，包含路由器、更新器和个性化门网络，在训练中判断任务间利害关系，利用有效梯度减少冲突。

Result: 在150亿样本的真实推荐数据集上，DRGrad性能优于其他MTL模型，在AUC指标上表现出色，还能处理噪声；在公共数据集上也展示了判断和路由任务利害关系的能力。

Conclusion: DRGrad能有效管理多任务学习环境中的任务冲突，不增加模型复杂度，还能解决噪声处理缺陷。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Result: 得到简洁、有语义意义的表示。

Conclusion: DecompNet是首个实现全 - 但 - 一残差更新规则的语义自编码器。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

Motivation: 研究制度条件生成场景与凸CVaR分配器结合能否改善制度转换下的投资组合决策。

Method: 引入Multi - Agent Regime - Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD)，通过高斯HMM推断潜在制度，用尾部加权目标和制度专用的专家混合（MoE）去噪器训练扩散模型，将生成场景输入到有明确治理的考虑换手率的CVaR上镜图二次规划中。

Result: 在严格的向前回测中，MARCD优于标准分配器，在2020 - 2025年样本外测试中，Sharpe比率达1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），降低34%，夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD为从尾部忠实场景建模到有治理的投资组合决策提供了可复制的桥梁，能显著改善回撤控制。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Method: 开发框架，通过因子联合识别相似资产、定价错误并制定交易策略；使用注意力因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习；用通用序列模型识别因子残差组合的时间序列信号；联合估计因子和套利交易策略。

Result: 注意力因子模型在24年里对美国最大的股票实现了样本外夏普比率超4，一步解决方案扣除交易成本后夏普比率达2.3。

Conclusion: 联合估计因子和套利交易策略对最大化交易成本后的盈利能力至关重要，弱因子对套利交易很重要。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

Result: 建立AutoGD收敛性，在无平滑常数知识下恢复GD最优速率，实验表现好。

Conclusion: AutoGD及其扩展方法在多种问题中表现出色，可自动调整学习率。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

Conclusion: 提出的点集神经网络在处理NOvA实验探测器数据上更有效，内存使用少且性能更好。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为调整DPMs的归纳偏置提供了简单且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

Motivation: 改进电化学阻抗谱（EIS）数据建模中损失函数的性能。

Method: 引入log - B和log - BW损失函数，用生成的EIS大数据集评估其与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方、计算效率和MAPE等方面的性能。

Result: 不同损失函数对收敛性、计算效率、拟合优度和MAPE有影响，X2损失函数在拟合优度指标上表现最佳，log - B速度约快1.4倍且多数电路组件MAPE更低。

Conclusion: 若首要目标是拟合优度，首选X2损失函数；在大规模最小二乘拟合的数据驱动应用中，log - B是有力替代方案。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Conclusion: TreeDiff是一种有效的可控图生成方法，能在不重新训练的情况下扩展搜索空间并保持计算可行性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

Conclusion: 所提出的SODA方案能有效解决现有方法的局限性，提升跨模态哈希性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有LLM推理系统独立处理引擎和查询，导致资源效率低，虽有复用KV缓存等提案，但缺乏高效的KV缓存跨引擎和查询的卸载与通信机制。

Method: 提出LMCache，提取和存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，在引擎接口暴露KV缓存，支持缓存卸载和预填充 - 解码分离，有高性能数据移动优化、模块化连接器组件和一流控制API。

Result: 结合vLLM在不同工作负载下吞吐量最高提升15倍，被企业推理系统广泛采用。

Conclusion: LMCache是高效的开源KV缓存解决方案，为未来KV缓存方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI工具可有效改进因果估计。

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 所提分层优化框架可有效解决低空经济网络中无人机实时多模态推理的准确性和通信效率问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

Conclusion: 研究结果影响神经网络训练实践，建立了关键学习期和热启动训练研究的联系。

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽有数据隐私进步但仍有风险，传统差分隐私固定预算在模型收敛时会引入过多噪声影响性能。

Method: 使用拉普拉斯和高斯机制实现差分隐私方法，扩展SelecEval模拟器，在高斯机制中引入自适应裁剪方法。

Result: 在不同隐私预算、IID和非IID数据集以及不同每轮选择客户端数量的实验中，虽限于200轮训练，但结果显示自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪可兼顾模型准确性与隐私保护。

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪能在保护隐私的同时维持模型准确性。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: 提出的算法框架能平衡现有策略的极端情况，有理论和实践效果。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该框架能在预测因子相关且偏差可能意外重现的环境中，提供灵活且可推广的特征选择方式。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Conclusion: 所提出的机器学习驱动的RFF通用框架具有可行性和实用性，适用于多种下游任务和应用场景。

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Result: 在不同模型和数据集上，Kelp平均F1比现有事后护栏和先前插件探针高15.61%，仅用2000万参数，每token延迟小于0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp框架能有效实现大模型生成过程中的实时风险检测，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Method: 从上下文学习理论对Transformer在TSF中的局限性进行理论分析，在AR(p)数据下推导结论，并通过实验验证。

Result: 得出线性自注意力（LSA）模型在上下文预测中不能比经典线性模型有更低的预期均方误差、上下文长度趋于无穷时LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器、思维链风格推理下预测指数级收敛到均值等结论。

Conclusion: 理论揭示了未被充分探索的现象，为设计有效架构提供实用见解，鼓励研究界重新审视TSF的基本理论局限。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Conclusion: VCON是可应用于现有压缩技术的通用方法，在多基准测试中有一致增益。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Conclusion: 所提出的组自适应对抗训练策略能有效提升假新闻检测模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Conclusion: 对于未知最优超参数的新任务，建议使用Momo和MuonMax组合以节省超参数调整成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的大量实验表明，PTDI能严格控制FDR并实现更高的功效。

Conclusion: PTDI是一种能严格控制FDR、有效识别训练数据的方法。

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Conclusion: ParBaLS EPIG在主动学习中有较好性能，代码开源。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 所提联邦k - 均值算法能有效解决联邦聚类问题且具备隐私保护特性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

Conclusion: 应使用预测误差分析鲁棒学习，研究给出了原则性调参规则并可扩展到其他鲁棒损失。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

Motivation: 现有模型路由性能依赖准确模型表示，添加新模型需重新训练，可扩展性受限。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中均达到了最先进的路由性能，可无缝集成新模型而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了模型路由的性能和可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at
https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.

Motivation: 气候模型的季节性预测系统存在偏差和时空误差，现有误差校正方法多为确定性调整，决策需要对不确定性和事件可能性进行量化。

Method: 引入基于条件变分自编码器模型的概率误差校正框架，映射给定有偏模型预测下观测值的条件分布。

Result: 使用确定性和概率性指标评估，调整后的预测校准更好，更接近观测分布，误差小于气候均值调整的预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的概率误差校正框架能有效改进北极海冰浓度季节性预测。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate

in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Method: 提出Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，利用多级注意力架构，包括时间注意力层和跨特征注意力层构建特征交互图。

Result: 在死亡率和疾病进展任务中显著优于现有方法，能揭示其他模型难以发现的临床有意义的患者特定疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI框架在临床时间序列数据建模中具有更好的预测准确性和透明度，有助于临床决策。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: ARROW为全球天气预报领域建立了有前景的范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和策略师提供了强大工具，可增强动态市场中的决策和风险管理。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

Result: 大五人格对在线社区描述更有力可解释，机器学习聚类无有意义区分，未识别外向性，缺乏心理测量连贯性。

Conclusion: 肯定大五人格稳健性，人格语义结构依赖语境，机器学习可检验理论生态效度但无法取代既定理论。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

Motivation: 现有不完整多视图谱聚类方法需用K - means生成聚类结果，且未有效利用聚类结果反映的样本连通性。

Method: 提出CRG_IMSC算法，通过对提取特征施加非负约束直接获得聚类结果，根据谱聚类结果构建连通矩阵并最小化基于该矩阵的自表示残差，用乘性更新迭代算法求解优化问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CRG_IMSC对多视图数据的聚类效果优于现有聚类方法，实验结果证明了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC算法能有效解决现有不完整多视图谱聚类方法的缺陷，且具有良好的性能和收敛性。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Motivation: 主动学习在标签有噪声或数据分布变化时可靠性受影响，传统启发式方法会放大错误。

Method: 提出NCAL - R框架，引入类均值对齐扰动分数和特征波动分数两个互补信号。

Result: 在ImageNet - 100和CIFAR100上实验表明，NCAL - R优于标准基线，用更少标签获更高准确率，在合成标签噪声下更鲁棒，对分布外数据泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入获取决策可使主动学习对标注错误和分布变化更具鲁棒性，是向实际标注管道可靠部署的关键一步。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Conclusion: 所提算法能在状态聚合时平衡计算效率和性能损失，在满足条件时保证最优策略等价。

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出HiLoMoE框架用于CTR预测，结合垂直和水平扩展优势，在四个公开数据集上实验显示能实现更好的性能 - 效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直扩展通过层堆叠提升模型表达能力但计算效率低，水平扩展的MoE难以捕捉推荐任务的层次结构，为提升投资回报率，需结合两者优势。

Method: 提出HiLoMoE框架，采用轻量级秩 - 1专家进行参数高效的水平扩展，堆叠多个具有层次路由的MoE层，基于前一层分数而非输出进行路由以实现并行执行，使用三阶段训练框架确保优化和专家多样性。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，相比非MoE基线，AUC平均提升0.20%，FLOPs降低18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE能在CTR预测中实现更好的性能 - 效率权衡。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Method: 引入原始方法，采用精确Lipschitz证书收紧上界；提出WDA直接构建最坏情况分布候选；利用ReLU网络激活单元的分段仿射结构。

Result: 与现有方法相比，实现了有竞争力的鲁棒准确率，证书更紧。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决WDRO现有方法的局限。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖大量环境交互样本，复杂环境计算成本高，需提升小样本训练效率和稳定性。

Method: 提出新的策略神经网络架构，中间为预训练网络，夹在两个全连接网络间，在相似物理环境预训练部分网络。

Result: PPOPT在小训练样本上奖励和训练稳定性超经典PPO；训练时间比基于模型的方法如DYNA DDPG少，但性能不如。

Conclusion: PPOPT在小样本训练有优势，以开源软件形式发布。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

Conclusion: 从损失景观几何角度解释了循环变压器的优势，并通过SHIFT框架加速其训练。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

Conclusion: HeSRN是一种有效且高效的异构图表示学习方法。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: Cyc - Attack方法可解决现有DLWF模型对抗攻击的局限，使对抗性预报更真实且不易被检测。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

TL;DR: 提出用于XMC模型的纯低精度训练框架ELMO，减少GPU内存使用且不影响精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XMC方法使用FP16 - FP32混合精度训练不稳定、内存使用和计算开销大，现有低精度方法对分类层保留高精度。

Method: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型，利用Kahan求和与随机舍入，结合梯度融合和分块的内存优化方法。

Result: 能在Float8下有效训练XMC模型，训练300万标签的XMC模型仅需6.6 GiB GPU内存，而优化的SOTA方法需39.7 GiB。

Conclusion: ELMO可显著减少GPU内存使用，且不影响模型精度。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

Result: 在Pre - Exec Bench上，所提防护机制比强基线有持续提升，消融实验提炼出可行实践。

Conclusion: 为更安全的代理系统提供了实用模板。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性指标可用于隐私审计，基于此的简单防御方法有较好效果

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果关系反映表征的互补维度，其差异可揭示隐藏计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和调节的量，能连接通信渐近世界和学习有限世界。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER始终优于基线，提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: AER能有效解决RLVR训练中的问题，提升推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

TL;DR: 提出ProxRouter改进非参数查询路由器对异常查询的鲁棒性，实验显示有良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数和非参数大语言模型查询路由器在处理异常查询时存在泛化能力不足的问题，且训练集扩展成本高、难更新。

Method: 提出ProxRouter，应用指数倾斜聚合机制平衡非参数路由器的偏差和方差。

Result: ProxRouter在保持正常查询性能的同时，提升了对异常查询的路由能力，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ProxRouter可有效提高非参数查询路由器对异常查询的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究批量大小对Adam泛化性的影响，发现Adam和AdamW全批量版本测试误差大，小批量版本可接近零误差，还证明Adam有效权重衰减边界小于AdamW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要分析Adam全批量版本，而实际用的随机版本与之有本质区别，且随机Adam即使学习率极小也不收敛到全批量版本，需研究批量大小对其泛化性的影响。

Method: 分析图像数据上的两层过参数化CNN，进行理论推导和大量实验。

Result: Adam和AdamW全批量版本收敛到较差测试误差解，小批量版本可实现接近零测试误差；Adam有效权重衰减边界比AdamW小。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam泛化性能中起关键作用。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Motivation: 训练网页代理在复杂真实网站导航需掌握子任务，现有基准缺乏对该能力的广泛评估。

Method: 引入WARC - Bench基准，探索监督微调（SFT）和可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）两种训练技术。

Result: WARC - Bench对领先模型有挑战性，最高成功率64.8%；SFT模型成功率48.8%；RLVR在SFT基础上使成功率提升至52.8%。

Conclusion: 掌握子任务对稳健网页规划和导航至关重要，现有基准未广泛评估该能力。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 强化学习在优化大语言模型推理能力上有显著优势，尤其在泛化和利用测试时计算资源方面。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间动态图表示学习方法存在嵌入陈旧、上下文感知不足、无法充分捕捉结构动态等问题。

Method: 引入TAWRMAC框架，集成时间匿名重启游走、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入，利用内存增强GNN和固定时间编码增强嵌入稳定性，通过捕捉邻居相关性改善上下文表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，TAWRMAC在不同负采样策略下的动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在归纳和直推设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推动了连续时间动态图学习的发展。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出首个基于扩散的决策聚焦学习（DFL）方法，有两种实现方式并在决策质量上优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFL方法依赖确定性点预测，难以捕捉现实环境的内在随机性。

Method: 提出基于扩散的DFL方法，一是用重参数化技巧构建扩散DFL实现端到端训练；二是提出轻量级分数函数估计器避免通过采样反向传播。

Result: 经验表明扩散DFL方法在决策质量上始终优于强大的基线。

Conclusion: 所提出的扩散DFL方法有效，可提高决策质量。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Result: 得到直线性的PDE表征，完全刻画仿射时间插值，得出通用过程流几何的必要条件。

Conclusion: 为设计更易积分的传输提供了广泛指导。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在PyTorch到JAX翻译上存在困难，库设计、语义和生态差异大，且评估有弱点。

Method: 组装两个PyTorch源，用GPT - 4o - mini生成初始JAX草稿；专业开发者迭代修复草稿形成数据集；构造增强提示引导轻量级大语言模型；引入三个定制指标。

Result: T2J使GPT - 4o - mini在CodeBLEU上性能提升达10%，T2J FixCost Score提升50%，T2J CodeTrans Score提升1.33分，T2J Comparison Score提升100%，生成代码速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架能有效加强基于大语言模型的PyTorch到JAX的翻译。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

Conclusion: 所提出的摊销和基于粒子方法的协同采样方法是有效的，能提升采样和训练性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为新架构修改下Transformer的稳定性检查提供了原则性方法，为未来设计提供指导。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable

biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based

large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

Conclusion: 复值架构有表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义特征，需推进相位感知设计以挖掘复值表示潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

Motivation: 现有时间序列分割提示方法仅在局部上下文操作，提示效果易消失，无法指导全序列预测。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，用记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为记忆令牌存储在库中，使新预测能基于局部线索和累积提示。

Result: 在六个数据集上，单迭代推理下单粒度和多粒度分割精度分别提升23%和85%，迭代推理中每次迭代平均增益比PromptTSS高。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对提示引导分割很重要，MemPromptTSS是适用于现实应用的有效框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Conclusion: SQS - SD框架及其包含的两种方法能有效应对边缘云链路带宽限制问题，加速推理。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

Conclusion: 消融研究和潜在空间动力学分析验证了FPO各组件的贡献和条件流匹配目标在在线RL中的稳定收敛。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究多聚焦单一图表示，函数调用图和进程交互图的联合建模未充分探索，需对软件系统进行多视角深度分析。

Method: 提出GeminiNet统一神经网络方法，构建含635个Windows可执行文件的新数据集，通过Ghidra提取FCGs，Any.Run沙箱提取PCGs，采用带自适应门控机制的双图卷积分支。

Result: 联合嵌入表现优于单图模型。

Conclusion: GeminiNet能有效从FCGs和PCGs学习联合嵌入，为软件系统分析提供多视角方法。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Method: 提出BITE（Bidirectional Time - Freq Pyramid Network），包含多流协同、金字塔时频注意力、双向自适应卷积，整合时频流、基于PTFA的多尺度特征增强和可学习融合的BiTCN。

Result: BITE在四个不同范式中取得了最先进的性能，在受试者内准确性和跨受试者泛化方面表现出色，兼具MI和SSVEP任务的强大性能和高计算效率。

Conclusion: 范式对齐的频谱 - 时间处理对可靠的BCI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

Method: 使用更强的大语言模型作为教师，根据任务数据集创建技能列表并标注数据点，为学生创建缺失技能概况，构建STAT - Sel和STAT - Syn两种修改后的训练集。

Result: 在MATH上最多提升7.5%，在分布外基准测试中平均提升4.6%，与GRPO互补可进一步提升模型。

Conclusion: 技能目标自适应训练应广泛改进当前训练流程。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: FOSSIL是数据稀缺下医学成像中具有泛化性、数据高效性和可解释性的难度感知学习框架。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Result: O4M - SP能在不同箱子尺寸上成功泛化，显著优于基线方法，可有效处理有稳定性约束的装箱场景。

Conclusion: O4M - SP具有良好泛化性和实际应用价值，能解决现有方法的局限。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务实验中，Translution（包括α - Translution）精度优于自注意力。

Conclusion: Translution及其轻量级变体在相关任务中有效，能结合自注意力和卷积优势提升精度。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Conclusion: 统一了GNNs中表达能力和泛化的研究，解释了提高表达能力常以牺牲泛化为代价的原因。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

Conclusion: PANTHER是用于工业顺序用户行为建模的可扩展、高性能框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

Conclusion: PKD框架能有效结合LLMs和GNNs优势，用于少样本节点分类

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

TL;DR: 本文提出CacheClip框架解决RAG系统TTFT瓶颈和效率质量权衡问题，实验显示其在性能和加速方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统存在TTFT瓶颈，现有KV缓存重用方法有缺陷，APE和CacheBlend等方法仍不足。

Method: 提出CacheClip框架，集成辅助模型引导的令牌选择、共享前缀和分组策略三种技术。

Result: CacheClip在NIAH和LongBench上保留较高全注意力性能，优于APE和CacheBlend，且加速LLM推理。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统的效率 - 质量权衡提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工质量指标，难以准确评估剪枝对模型性能的影响。

Method: 提出PermLLM框架，使用Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转换为可微软置换矩阵实现端到端优化，采用块级通道置换策略降低参数和计算复杂度，与现有一次性剪枝方法集成。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen和OPT模型上的实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM能有效优化N:M稀疏模型，减轻剪枝带来的误差。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前时间序列预测方法多以黑盒方式编码数据，依赖试错优化，解释性和理论理解有限，且数据分布动态变化给准确预测带来挑战。

Method: 提出FIRE统一频域分解框架，包括独立建模振幅和相位分量、自适应学习频率基分量权重、设计针对性损失函数、采用新的稀疏数据训练范式。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，FIRE始终优于现有模型，取得了更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: FIRE框架能实现可解释且鲁棒的时间序列预测，显著增强时间序列的可解释性。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Conclusion: STEER是一种有效缓解RLVR训练中熵坍缩问题的方案，能提升模型性能。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal

However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain
underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic

response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we
introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed

(featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22
Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9
implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems,
offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of
different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future
research. The code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: CauchyNet是数据驱动预测建模的有效高效工具，尤其适用于资源和数据受限环境。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in
resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Result: 方法在QM9和ZINC250k分子图生成基准测试上实现了卓越性能和更快的生成速度。

Conclusion: GraphBFN有效解决了现有模型的局限，在分子图生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGM可作为学习系统中持续、风险感知自我修改的基础架构。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Conclusion: PSCNet能有效建模土壤湿度数据时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor

Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their

\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially

Conclusion: 所提框架有效提升了车辆路径问题模型在不同问题规模上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

TL;DR: 介绍VivaBench多轮基准测试评估大语言模型顺序临床推理能力，发现当前模型在不确定性下推理有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准主要评估知识回忆，缺乏对顺序临床推理能力的评估，需填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含1762个医生整理临床案例的VivaBench，模拟医学培训口试场景，要求模型多步推理诊断。

Result: 当前大语言模型在明确临床描述诊断表现尚可，但在不确定性迭代诊断推理中性能显著下降，存在多种失败模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医疗AI系统提供标准化基准，也为智能体AI研究做贡献。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型智能体在新环境中样本效率低，现有架构未充分利用语言模型生成和推理反事实轨迹的能力。

Method: 引入ECHO框架，由后视规则和更新规则组成，后视规则识别子目标并生成优化轨迹，更新规则维护轨迹表示。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA两个领域，ECHO最多比普通语言智能体基线性能高80%，在XMiniGrid中也优于Reflexion和AWM等架构。

Conclusion: ECHO能通过有效利用过往经验，更快适应新环境。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Motivation: GNN在稠密图上效率低，常见的图稀疏化方法有局限性，需新方法。

Method: 引入多视图图元框架，将图划分为不相交子图，通过受非对易算子理论启发的异构消息传递架构学习多视图表示。

Result: 在分子属性预测和宇宙学参数推断两个应用中，多视图图元模型表现优于单图基线。

Conclusion: 多视图方法有强大能力和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Motivation: 抗抑郁药不依从普遍，会导致多种不良后果，目前检测依从性的方法有局限，临床医生需要能及时检测依从性失误的工具。

Method: 用基于Transformer的模型分析消费级可穿戴设备或非接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据来推断抗抑郁药摄入情况。

Result: 该生物标志物在六个数据集上的AUROC为0.84，跨药物类别通用，随剂量变化，对伴随的精神药物有鲁棒性，能捕获现实世界的用药起始、减量和失误情况。

Conclusion: 此方法可提供客观、可扩展的依从性监测，有改善抑郁护理和结果的潜力。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出NMF - LAB方法，将分类定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，实验证明其在分类任务中有竞争力且有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准非负矩阵分解（NMF）是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签，现有监督或半监督扩展方法有局限。

Method: 提出NMF - LAB方法，将分类重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接对标签矩阵进行分解。

Result: 在不同数据集上实验表明，NMF - LAB有有竞争力的预测准确率、对噪声或不完整标签的鲁棒性和高维问题的可扩展性。

Conclusion: NMF - LAB在三因子NMF框架内统一回归和分类，为现代分类任务提供了新的、概率性和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

Conclusion: 增强了对更现实场景下上下文学习算法的理论理解，推动相关直觉发展，有助于向更大模型的理论拓展。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

Conclusion: MTL - FSL框架能提升预测准确性和生物学可解释性，实现了最优性能

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

Motivation: 研究反向监督策略在机器学习中的应用及监督需求。

Method: 分析反向监督策略，在大的无标签集B上搜索标签以最小化小的有标签集A的误差。

Result: 搜索空间大，复杂度呈指数级，即使计算速度提升也不能消除对信息标签或先验的需求。

Conclusion: 极端计算速度可减少时间，但学习的基本监督需求仍需人类或类人初始输入。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Result: 在9个物联网相关数据集和4种骨干架构上进行广泛实验，MSE最多改善22.8%，参数仅增加4.0%。

Conclusion: LightSAE有效且参数高效。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Conclusion: AnyBCQ将算法灵活性与硬件效率结合，为多精度大语言模型部署提供实用基础。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

Motivation: 现有基于核的相对相似性测试方法在手动指定替代假设后进行核选择存在挑战，使得测试定义不明确。

Method: 提出AMD方法，将相对相似性定义为(U, P)和(U, Q)距离在深度核空间中的最大差异，测试分为两阶段，第一阶段估计AMD并推断潜在假设，第二阶段评估假设的统计显著性。

Result: 理论上验证了方法，在基准数据集上的大量实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过同时学习假设和核函数的方法，能有效解决相对相似性测试中核选择的问题。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

TL;DR: 提出Align2Act框架将指令微调大语言模型转化为与人类行为一致的可解释规划器，在真实世界基准测试中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型是否真正捕捉人类驾驶逻辑的问题，应对复杂场景下自动驾驶运动规划挑战。

Method: 推导基于人类推理模式和交通规则的结构化驾驶指令，用Align2ActChain模块引导逐步推理，在nuPlan数据集上用LoRA微调LLaMA - 2 - 7B。

Result: 在Test14 - random上取得开环分数85.17，闭环分数70.31（非反应式）和66.96（反应式），在真实世界nuPlan闭环基准测试中规划质量和类人性提升。

Conclusion: 结构化推理比基线大语言模型规划器显著提高性能。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有影响估计方法受训练随机性影响不稳定，难以用于数据管理和清理。

Method: 引入基于假设检验的f - influence框架，设计f - INE算法在单轮训练中计算f - influence。

Result: 将f - INE扩展用于估计指令调优数据对Llama - 3.1 - 8B的影响，能可靠检测毒化样本。

Conclusion: f - influence框架和f - INE算法适用于可靠的影响估计，可用于数据清理和解释模型行为。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗研发因数据稀缺和严格隐私法规受限，阻碍创新和患者护理进步，合成数据可解决问题。

Method: 引入集成五种增强方法的混合框架，通过强化学习动态选权机制结合，采用先进校准技术。

Result: 在数据集上评估，Wasserstein距离低、KS统计量小，趋势得分高，隐私保护好，下游分类器准确率和F1分数高。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展、保护隐私，达先进水平，为医疗联合分布保真度设新基准。

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Result: 在Rotated MNIST和ADNI等数据集上，预测准确率和域选择效率显著提高。

Conclusion: 所提方法优于传统连续域自适应方法，能同时优化转移路径和目标任务性能，提高域适应过程的有效性。

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Motivation: 当前基准无法可靠区分大语言模型强化学习的进一步进展，需研究该现象。

Method: 引入诊断套件和OPG指标，进行压力测试。

Result: 现有强化学习方法在分布转移、难度变化和反事实场景中泛化能力不足，当前基准未能揭示这些问题。

Conclusion: 当前基准不足以评估泛化能力，提出设计基准的三项核心原则。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

TL;DR: 提出多尺度频率感知对抗多实例网络（MFAM）用于帕金森病严重程度评估，实验表明其优于通用时间序列模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用时间序列模型在帕金森病特征提取中缺乏病理特异性，传统聚合方法易稀释关键诊断特征，使评估复杂。

Method: 提出MFAM模型，通过医学先验知识引导的频率分解模块增强特征特异性，引入基于注意力的多实例学习框架聚焦有诊断价值的稀疏片段。

Result: 在公共PADS数据集和私有数据集上验证，MFAM在处理复杂临床时间序列上优于通用时间序列模型。

Conclusion: MFAM为帕金森病严重程度自动评估提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

Conclusion: 能够为深度学习中组合性优势提供几何解释，构建自包含的基于对称性的预测编码。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Motivation: EEG - BCIs受数据稀缺和个体差异严重制约，影响EEG解码模型的泛化和应用。

Method: 提出基于解纠缠表示学习和特征融合的FusionGen框架，通过特征匹配融合模块整合试验特征，并结合轻量级特征提取和重建管道。

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有增强技术，分类准确率有显著提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen能有效解决EEG - BCIs面临的数据问题，提高模型性能。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 构建学习模型需评估大量中间模型，评估结果影响后续决策，而真实性能需评估后才知晓，因此要解决有限预算下中间模型空间的最优探索问题。

Method: 将问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的通用预算分配问题。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Result: 在不同股票数据集上实验，EDGAN在预测准确性和训练稳定性上表现优越，在市场条件下优于传统GAN变体。

Conclusion: EDGAN模型在股票价格预测中能实现更好的预测准确性和收敛稳定性。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

Conclusion: 提出的ImpMIA方法能有效解决现有黑盒攻击依赖假设的问题，在现实场景有良好应用前景。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN虽表现出色，但模型尺寸大、计算和内存需求高，在低复杂度数据集上训练存在计算浪费等问题，难以在资源受限设备部署。

Method: 引入ODNs，提出类似NAS的渐进深度扩展训练策略，从较浅深度开始训练，逐渐增加深度直至达到目标精度，去除冗余层。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN上，ResNet - 18和ResNet - 34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时分别保持99.31%和96.08%的竞争力精度。

Conclusion: ODNs能平衡模型深度和任务复杂度，降低训练和推理成本，减少内存占用，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型中训练用随机采样器和推理用确定性采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题，关注推理时能否产生高质量输出。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型（gDDIM）框架支持任意高的随机性，并在整个过程中保留数据边缘分布。

Result: 大规模实验验证训练过程中奖励差距不断缩小，使用高随机性SDE训练更新模型时，ODE采样质量提高。

Conclusion: 理论刻画了奖励差距并给出通用扩散模型的非空边界，以及VE和VP高斯模型更精确的收敛速率，证明了高随机性SDE训练的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Result: OmniGNN在公共数据集上优于现有股票预测模型，在新冠期间展现强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniGNN是一种有效的股票预测模型，能应对宏观经济冲击。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN - LLM架构有价值，选择性调用LLM可在大图上可扩展部署且无高计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

TL;DR: 提出PerSyn合成策略解决教师模型输出与学生模型学习能力不匹配问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究中强教师模型输出与学生模型学习能力不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出PerSyn策略，采用“Route then Generate”范式，通过查询级路由器分配提示，教师只为分配的提示合成数据。

Result: 在不同模型家族和规模的实验中，PerSyn在指令调优和数学推理设置中表现优于或等同于所有基线。

Conclusion: 验证了PerSyn的有效性，为未来研究提供了额外见解。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病神经退行性影响不可逆，早期发现高危个体可实现预防、及时护理和资源合理分配。

Result: 框架优于现有方法和数据挑战排行榜，有高准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性，确定了关键社会健康决定因素和年龄特定特征模式。

Conclusion: 认知老化是多因素的，基于数据的社会健康决定因素建模有价值。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

TL;DR: 提出MC#框架结合静态量化和动态专家剪枝对MoE - LLMs/VLMs进行压缩，在DeepSeek - VL2上实现显著权重减少和计算量降低，性能损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE在增加模型容量时引入显著计算和内存开销，专家模块成为模型大小和推理成本的主要来源，需对其进行压缩。

Method: 提出MC#框架，包含Pre - Loading Mixed - Precision Quantization (PMQ)优化位分配，Online Top - any Pruning (OTP)动态选择专家子集，结合两者实现压缩。

Result: 在DeepSeek - VL2上实现6.2倍权重减少，平均2.57位，多模态基准测试准确率仅下降1.7%；OTP减少超20%专家激活，性能下降不到1%。

Conclusion: MC#框架在高效部署基于MoE的模型方面有强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应边际机制能让奖励模型更好捕捉选择和拒绝响应的分布差异，在性能、收敛速度和泛化能力上有显著提升。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨4位量化在推理模型中的适用性，解决推理模型内存优化问题。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA - Diamond上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验。

Result: 发现规模依赖的权衡，不同规模模型在内存分配上有不同的准确性表现，该规模阈值还影响并行扩展效率和KV缓存处理方式。

Conclusion: 大语言模型内存优化不能忽略规模因素，不同规模推理模型需不同优化策略，与非推理模型不同。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Method: 提出非可转移示例（NEs），在特定模型的低敏感度子空间内重新编码输入，通过子空间不对齐降低未授权模型的性能。

Result: 在常见预处理下，NEs在多种视觉骨干网络和最先进的视觉语言模型上保留了性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，可保留数据预期效用并防止未经授权的利用。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Result: 在多个领域的真实应用实验中，InstructUE显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 指令感知的用户建模能在特定场景实现指令引导的用户信息去噪，为更具泛化性和鲁棒性的用户表示学习奠定基础。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

Motivation: 当前核心集选择算法主要关注干净准确率，在保留鲁棒性方面不足，需从数据中心视角设计对抗鲁棒模型。

Method: 提出将样本对抗脆弱性与硬度关联的框架，用平均输入梯度范数量化硬度，提出EasyCore算法，保留低平均输入梯度范数样本用于训练。

Result: 在标准和对抗训练下，用EasyCore选择的数据训练的模型比竞争方法有更高的对抗准确率，在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下分别最多提升7%和5%。

Conclusion: EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，可提高对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

Conclusion: 新的不确定性量化框架在图时间序列预测中有效，能提供用户指定的覆盖率保证且预测区域更小。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

Motivation: 扩散模型即使训练良好也会在生成过程中积累误差，应用任意引导时会破坏样本保真度，出现离流形现象。

Method: 利用时间预测器估计每个时间步与所需数据流形的偏差，设计TAG引导机制，在生成的每个时间步将样本拉回所需流形。

Result: 通过大量实验表明，TAG在每个时间步都能生成与所需流形紧密对齐的样本。

Conclusion: TAG能显著提高各种下游任务的生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Result: 在游戏、规划、编码和数学任务中取得显著收益，长时规划准确率大幅提升，编码和数学推理性能提高。

Conclusion: AT - GRPO能有效提升多智能体系统中基于策略的强化学习性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and

Conclusion: TED是面向实际边缘应用的实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

TL;DR: 提出PhysioME框架解决生理信号医疗应用中模态缺失问题，实验表明其在不同模态缺失场景有高一致性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生理信号医疗应用方法多假设所有模态可用，模态缺失时性能下降，需解决该局限。

Method: 采用结合对比学习与掩码预测的多模态自监督学习方法、定制的Dual - PathNeuroNet骨干网络和恢复解码器。

Result: PhysioME在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME有潜力成为在数据不完整的现实临床决策中的可靠工具。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

Conclusion: 小型专用大语言模型经精心微调可在车辆路径问题中生成高性能组件，RFTHGS框架有效。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

Motivation: 热图像面部特征点检测缺乏视觉线索，传统跨模态方案计算成本高或有结构伪影，限制实际应用。

Method: 提出Multi - Level Cross - Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM - KD)框架，引入Dual - Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD)双向机制进行跨模态知识蒸馏。

Result: 在公共热图像面部特征点检测基准测试中达到新的最优水平，显著优于先前方法并大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决热图像面部特征点检测问题，能实现准确且高效的检测。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Result: TACT在真实世界分布外基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TACT方法有效，能提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Conclusion: 所提的含核多样性的聚合统计量和带选择推断的测试框架有效，能在复杂结构化数据的两样本和独立性测试中取得良好效果。

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

Motivation: 现有推理语言模型和测试时缩放方法为生成多候选序列需大量计算，且各提示分配相同计算预算，未考虑提示复杂度差异。

Method: 提出EAGer方法，通过标记级熵分布利用模型不确定性，仅在高熵标记处分支到多推理路径，并重新分配计算预算。

Result: 在复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer不访问目标标签可重新分配预算，实现推理长度和Pass@k的最佳效率 - 性能权衡；访问目标标签时，与全并行采样相比，可减少最多65%的标记生成并使Pass@k最多提高37%。

Conclusion: EAGer方法能有效减少冗余计算，提升整体性能，实现更好的效率 - 性能权衡。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: 证明了Tool RL在LLM推理中的跨领域潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

Result: 模型的预测始终受到非漏洞代码行的影响而产生偏差。

Conclusion: 表明数据中的偏差和虚假关联对模型预测有很大影响。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Motivation: 现实中很多图节点缺乏信息特征向量，有效分类依赖学习能捕捉结构角色和拓扑上下文的节点嵌入。

Method: 引入联合优化三个互补目标的快速半监督嵌入框架，包括通过可扩展模块化近似进行无监督结构保留、监督正则化以最小化标记节点的类内方差、通过基于随机游走和注意力加权相似性的标签传播来细化未标记节点，统一为单一迭代优化方案。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法分类准确率与现有最优方法相当或更优，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在处理无信息特征向量图的节点分类问题上有效且高效。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Result: 与直接对原始数据应用分类器相比，平衡准确率有所提高。

Conclusion: 该解决方案很有前景，尤其是在无标签数据可用性增加的情况下。

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Conclusion: 该方法能在异质数据场景下有效提升全局模型泛化能力和局部模型个性化适应能力。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Conclusion: 推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标的投影，ENIGMA训练的模型无需奖励模型即可进行原则推理。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的时空流量预测对城市移动网络资源管理至关重要，但大语言模型难以处理网格流量数据的复杂空间依赖，且处理大量地理网格信息效率低。

Method: 将时空预测转化为视觉 - 语言融合问题，利用视觉大语言模型的视觉编码器处理历史全局流量矩阵，引入高效编码方案处理数值数据，采用监督微调（SFT）和组相对策略优化（GRPO）训练模型。

Result: 在真实移动流量数据集上，长期预测精度比现有方法高15.6%，跨领域少样本场景中比次优基线高30.04%。

Conclusion: 模型在各种数据稀缺环境中具有很强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

environment that wraps TORAX for simulating the plasma dynamics. The objective
is formulated through rewards depending on the simulated state of the plasma
and control action to optimize specific characteristics of the plasma, such as
performance and stability. The resulting environment instance is then
compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms and libraries and will facilitate
RL research in plasma control. In its current version, one environment is
readily available, based on a ramp-up scenario of the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

Motivation: 现有KV缓存存在内存开销大问题，现有KV检索方法在长序列推理场景有效率和精度瓶颈，需高效解决方案。

Method: 提出LouisKV框架，包括语义感知检索策略、解耦细粒度管理方案和内核级优化。

Result: LouisKV在不同长序列任务中比现有方法实现高达4.7倍加速，且保持近无损精度。

Conclusion: LouisKV能有效解决长序列场景下KV缓存检索的效率和精度问题。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

Result: 定性和定量证明DiffTSST实现了有效的风格迁移。

Conclusion: DiffTSST能实现有效风格迁移，其数据增强可提高稀缺数据下的异常检测性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络在节点分类任务中依赖完整节点特征，现实场景中特征矩阵稀疏或含敏感信息，导致性能下降和隐私风险。

Method: 提出MFP框架，将可用特征划分为多个高斯噪声视图，各视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，聚合表示生成节点嵌入。

Result: 在图数据集上实验表明，MFP在节点分类上优于现有基线，大幅减少隐私泄露，传播输出可作为特征替代插补。

Conclusion: MFP为特征缺失或含敏感信息的图学习提供了有效且注重隐私的框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

Motivation: 现有级联排序中Top - K算子不可微阻碍端到端训练，现有方法存在目标不一致、梯度冲突和复杂度高的问题。

Conclusion: 首次将可微Top - K算子引入推荐系统，实现理论最优线性时间复杂度，开源代码促进研究。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Method: 对重缩放乘数应用更强量化降低成本，引入重缩放感知训练微调超低位宽重缩放乘数。

Result: 重缩放器宽度减少8倍，经少量增量再训练可保持全精度。

Conclusion: 该方法可使资源受限嵌入式系统的AI推理更节能、更具成本效益。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook在基于视觉的前端代码生成方面始终优于强大的基线。

Conclusion: 强调了代理感知、视觉奖励和训练推理解耦的好处。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决现有RAG系统处理多跳问题的局限。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

Conclusion: 实验表明BGPO在数学问题求解、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于先前的RL算法。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: 提出QeRL框架，结合量化与低秩适应解决大语言模型强化学习资源密集问题，实验表明其高效有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型强化学习资源密集，需大量GPU内存和长部署时间，要解决此问题。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化与低秩适应（LoRA），引入自适应量化噪声（AQN）机制。

Result: 在部署阶段提速超1.5倍，能在单H100 80GB GPU上进行32B大语言模型强化学习训练，奖励增长更快、最终准确率更高。

Conclusion: QeRL是大语言模型强化学习训练的高效有效框架。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络中对抗样本出现的时间和原因，针对现有竞争观点提出新解释。

Method: 分析叠加现象，展示其如何使潜在表征被对手利用，利用合成设置控制叠加并在ViT模型上验证。

Result: 表明对抗扰动利用叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列预测，框架解释了两种已知现象，在合成和实际模型中证明叠加会导致对抗脆弱性。

Conclusion: 对抗脆弱性是网络表征压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入导致。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出CaDRO框架，将因果发现嵌入优化流程，能缩减设计空间，使模拟电路多目标优化比NSGA - II快达10倍，还能提升Pareto质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟电路多目标优化受高维参数空间、强反馈耦合和昂贵仿真阻碍，现有进化算法如NSGA - II平等对待所有参数，影响可扩展性。

Method: 引入CaDRO框架，通过混合观测 - 干预过程构建定量因果图，按参数对目标的因果效应排序，固定低影响参数，对关键驱动参数进行搜索。

Result: 在放大器、调节器和射频电路中，CaDRO比NSGA - II收敛快达10倍，能保留或提升Pareto质量，如折叠共源共栅放大器超体积从0.56提升到0.94，LDO调节器从0.65提升到0.81。

Conclusion: CaDRO框架有效解决了模拟电路多目标优化的问题，提高了优化效率和质量。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization of analog circuits is hindered by
high-dimensional parameter spaces, strong feedback couplings, and expensive
transistor-level simulations. Evolutionary algorithms such as Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are widely used but treat all parameters
equally, thereby wasting effort on variables with little impact on performance,
which limits their scalability. We introduce CaDRO, a causal-guided
dimensionality reduction framework that embeds causal discovery into the
optimization pipeline. CaDRO builds a quantitative causal map through a hybrid
observational-interventional process, ranking parameters by their causal effect
on the objectives. Low-impact parameters are fixed to values from high-quality
solutions, while critical drivers remain active in the search. The reduced
design space enables focused evolutionary optimization without modifying the
underlying algorithm. Across amplifiers, regulators, and RF circuits, CaDRO
converges up to 10$\times$ faster than NSGA-II while preserving or improving
Pareto quality. For instance, on the Folded-Cascode Amplifier, hypervolume
improves from 0.56 to 0.94, and on the LDO regulator from 0.65 to 0.81, with
large gains in non-dominated solutions.

Motivation: 现有CPU模拟器在模拟现代多核CPU时存在速度和准确性问题，机器学习方法也有局限，需新的模拟器来改善。

Method: 引入名为CAPSim的基于机器学习的CPU模拟器，采用基于注意力的神经网络性能预测器和带上下文注释的指令跟踪采样方法。

Conclusion: CAPSim优于现有最先进的深度学习方法，能有效提高CPU模拟的速度和准确性。

Abstract: CPU simulators are vital for computer architecture research, primarily for
estimating performance under different programs. This poses challenges for fast
and accurate simulation of modern CPUs, especially in multi-core systems.
Modern CPU peformance simulators such as GEM5 adopt the cycle-accurate and
event-driven approach, which is timeconsuming to simulate the extensive
microarchitectural behavior of a real benchmark running on out-of-order CPUs.
Recently, machine leaning based approach has been proposed to improve
simulation speed, but they are currently limited to estimating the cycles of
basic blocks rather than the complete benchmark program. This paper introduces
a novel ML-based CPU simulator named CAPSim, which uses an attention-based
neural network performance predictor and instruction trace sampling method
annotated with context. The attention mechanism effectively captures long-range
influence within the instruction trace, emphasizing critical context
information. This allows the model to improve performance prediction accuracy
by focusing on important code instruction. CAPSim can predict the execution
time of unseen benchmarks at a significantly fast speed compared with an
accurate O3 simulator built with gem5. Our evaluation on a commercial Intel
Xeon CPU demonstrates that CAPSim achieves a 2.2 - 8.3x speedup compared to
using gem5 built simulator, which is superior to the cutting-edge deep learning
approach

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems
capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field
lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions
interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey
presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,
bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We
analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy
spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,
fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code
generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the
field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems
incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory
mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that
illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final
deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying
complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys
that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting
50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling
researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future
directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code
generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based
methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and
practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered
software engineering systems.

Result: 评估30个大语言模型，发现它们在结合领域知识与交互式前端编码方面存在弱点。

Conclusion: InteractScience是首个自动测量结合能力的基准，为推进可靠且有教育用途的科学演示代码生成奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating complete
applications from natural language instructions, creating new opportunities in
science and education. In these domains, interactive scientific demonstrations
are particularly valuable for explaining concepts, supporting new teaching
methods, and presenting research findings. Generating such demonstrations
requires models to combine accurate scientific knowledge with the ability to
implement interactive front-end code that behaves correctly and responds to
user actions. This capability goes beyond the scope of existing benchmarks,
which typically evaluate either knowledge question answering without grounding
in code or static web code generation without scientific interactivity. To
evaluate this integrated ability, we design a hybrid framework that combines
programmatic functional testing to rigorously verify interaction logic with
visually-grounded qualitative testing to assess rendered outputs against
reference snapshots. Building on this framework, we present InteractScience, a
benchmark consisting of a substantial set of carefully designed questions
across five scientific domains, each paired with unit tests, reference
snapshots, and checklists. We evaluate 30 leading open- and closed-source LLMs
and report results that highlight ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain
knowledge with interactive front-end coding. Our work positions InteractScience
as the first benchmark to automatically measure this combined capability with
realistic interactive operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable
and educationally useful scientific demonstration code generation. All code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/open-compass/InteractScience.

Motivation: 探索利用LLM进行软件测试的有效方法，提高测试效率和准确性。

Method: 开发基于LLM的代理，对Python模块分析、推断属性、合成并执行PBT，反思测试输出，输出漏洞报告，还开发排名规则筛选高优先级漏洞。

Result: 对100个流行Python包评估，代理生成的漏洞报告56%为有效漏洞，32%会报告给维护者；前21个高分漏洞中86%有效，81%会报告；报告5个漏洞，4个有补丁，3个补丁成功合并。

Conclusion: LLM与PBT结合为自主测试软件提供了严格且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Property-based testing (PBT) is a lightweight formal method, typically
implemented as a randomized testing framework. Users specify the input domain
for their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the
expected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then
searches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test
function. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python
modules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and
documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these
tests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the
developer. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular
Python packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after
manual review that 56\% were valid bugs and 32\% were valid bugs that we would
report to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface
high-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring
bugs, 86\% were valid and 81\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure
modes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache
implementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and
cloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully. Our results suggest
that LLMs with PBT provides a rigorous and scalable method for autonomously
testing software. Our code and artifacts are available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 浮点程序错误修复重要，但开发者难区分不同类型错误，现有修复工具存在局限。

Method: 提出名为OFP - Repair的新方法。

Result: 在ACESO数据集上多个精度指标有显著提升；现实案例中检测和修复错误能力优于ACESO；修复GSL部分旧bug，获开发者关注。

Conclusion: OFP - Repair方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Errors in floating-point programs can lead to severe consequences,
particularly in critical domains such as military, aerospace, and financial
systems, making their repair a crucial research problem. In practice, some
errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require
high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to
excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to
distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail
to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on
high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand
specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision
programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal
results.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On
ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and
eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases,
our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors
and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are
based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To
further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from
GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The
developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering
integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working
on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging,
demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.

Method: 分析G2.com上超8000条AI开发平台用户评论，用零样本分类测量对9种MLOps实践的评价情感。

Result: 9种实践中7种与用户满意度显著正相关，小公司评论者较少讨论部分实践，公司规模不影响MLOps - 满意度关联。

Conclusion: 有效的MLOps实施对AI开发有实际价值，MLOps实践在各组织环境中普遍有益。

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence
(AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability,
maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that
integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing
the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices
support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains
limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI
development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure
review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous
integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility,
versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a
significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that
effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development.
However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms
discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational
context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does
not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied,
MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational
settings.

Motivation: 解决AI辅助调试产生不必要复杂性、破坏现有功能等问题，需可靠的多模型协调框架。

Method: 采用独立分析、交叉批判和仲裁的三相协议，用.txt模板作为提示桥，评估15个软件bug和69个AI生成的修复建议。

Result: SLEAN过滤接受22个修复建议，仲裁使代码更改面减少83 - 90%，最小类型2输入更高效，AI系统间一致性与修复质量弱相关。

Conclusion: SLEAN架构无需专业编码知识，适用于安全审计、代码审查等需多模型可靠合成及端到端可审计性的领域。

Abstract: We present SLEAN (Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network), a
deterministic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through
text-based prompt orchestration. Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring
specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between
LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for
deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis,
cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions
before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly
produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing
functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69
AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95%
CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied
verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90%
relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding
modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1
inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus
28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems
showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%)
occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points;
arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although
low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven,
provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding
expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document
verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis
with end-to-end auditability.

Result: 识别出一次主要的性能衰退，发现该衰退可通过GitHub actions重现，且由Linux内核版本变化导致。

Conclusion: 通过集成Nyrkiö到MooBench可有效检测GitHub项目性能变化。

Abstract: In GitHub with its 518 million hosted projects, performance changes within
these projects are highly relevant to the project's users. Although performance
measurement is supported by GitHub CI/CD, performance change detection is a
challenging topic.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how we incorporated Nyrki\"o to MooBench. Prior
to this work, Moobench continuously ran on GitHub virtual machines, measuring
overhead of tracing agents, but without change detection. By adding the upload
of the measurements to the Nyrki\"o change detection service, we made it
possible to detect performance changes. We identified one major performance
regression and examined the performance change in depth. We report that (1) it
is reproducible with GitHub actions, and (2) the performance regression is
caused by a Linux Kernel version change.

Motivation: 现有JavaScript混淆器评估忽略正确性，未验证是否保留程序语义，错误转换会带来诸多问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成程序草图并实例化为可执行程序进行不同配置下的混淆测试，同时从真实程序中自动提取草图。

Result: 发现11个未知正确性漏洞，对比显示其他fuzzers未检测到这些问题，消融实验表明除通用MRs外各组件至少对一类漏洞有贡献。

Conclusion: OBsmith是迈向混淆器及其他语义保留工具链自动化测试和质量保证的重要一步，引发关于平衡混淆预设和性能成本的讨论。

Abstract: JavaScript obfuscators are widely deployed to protect intellectual property
and resist reverse engineering, yet their correctness has been largely
overlooked compared to performance and resilience. Existing evaluations
typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of
whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect
transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and
erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this
gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript
obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to
generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language
constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable
programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides
LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic
extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more
focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain
knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown
correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose
state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE,
Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary
focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components
except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR
result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our
results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and
performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated
testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving
toolchains.

Motivation: 现有识别浮点程序错误输入方法存在高计算成本和长距离收敛能力有限的问题，需改进。

Method: 提出基于数学引导的MGDE方法，使用牛顿 - 拉夫逊方法检测错误输入。

Result: 在单输入程序中，MGDE检测到89个错误，FPCC检测到48个；FPCC耗时是MGDE的6.4096倍。在多输入程序中，MGDE检测到9个错误，FPCC未检测到，且FPCC平均计算时间长。

Conclusion: MGDE方法在检测浮点程序错误输入方面比现有方法FPCC更有效、更高效。

Abstract: Floating-point program errors can lead to severe consequences, particularly
in critical domains such as military applications. Only a small subset of
inputs may induce substantial floating-point errors, prompting researchers to
develop methods for identifying these error-inducing inputs. Although existing
approaches have achieved some success, they still suffer from two major
limitations: (1) High computational cost: The evaluation of error magnitude for
candidate inputs relies on high-precision programs, which are prohibitively
time-consuming. (2) Limited long-range convergence capability: Current methods
exhibit inefficiency in search, making the process akin to finding a needle in
a haystack.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel method, named MGDE, to
detect error-inducing inputs based on mathematical guidance. By employing the
Newton-Raphson method, which exhibits quadratic convergence properties, we
achieve highly effective and efficient results. Since the goal of identifying
error-inducing inputs is to uncover the underlying bugs, we use the number of
bugs detected in floating-point programs as the primary evaluation metric in
our experiments. As FPCC represents the most effective state-of-the-art
approach to date, we use it as the baseline for comparison. The dataset of FPCC
consists of 88 single-input floating-point programs. FPCC is able to detect 48
bugs across 29 programs, whereas our method successfully identifies 89 bugs
across 44 programs. Moreover, FPCC takes 6.4096 times as long as our proposed
method. We also deploy our method to multi-input programs, identifying a total
of nine bugs with an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds per program. In
contrast, FPCC fails to detect any bugs while requiring an average computation
time of 100 seconds per program.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC - V硬件软件生态系统快速扩张，需支持RISC - V Vector扩展，现有跨架构翻译手动重写耗时易错，规则方法有局限性。

Method: 提出基于大语言模型的多智能体方法IntrinTrans，利用编译测试反馈自动跨架构翻译内联函数代码，用活性分析的寄存器使用信息优化生成的RVV内联函数。

Result: 从开源库收集34个向量化算法案例进行实验，高级大语言模型大多能在有限迭代次数内生成语义正确的RISC - V Vector内联函数，部分案例性能达开源社区原生实现的5.93倍。

Conclusion: IntrinTrans方法能有效自动跨架构翻译内联函数代码并优化性能。

Abstract: The use of intrinsic functions to exploit hardware-specific capabilities is
an important approach for optimizing library performance. Many mainstream
libraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD
intrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software
ecosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV)
extension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics
is a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture
translation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and
error-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for
manual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete
rule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from
inadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a
LLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to
translate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further
optimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived
from liveness analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we
collected 34 vectorized algorithm cases from open-source libraries. Each case
includes an Arm Neon intrinsics implementation and a RVV intrinsics
implementation contributed by the open-source community, together with
correctness and performance tests. Our experiments show that advanced LLMs
produce semantically correct RISC-V Vector intrinsics in most cases within a
limited number of iterations, and in some cases achieve up to 5.93x the
performance of the native implementation from the open-source community.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在代码理解和推理方面取得进展，且公开的CVE信息日益丰富，探究大语言模型能否有效利用这些信息自动生成有效的PoC。

Method: 对GPT - 4o和DeepSeek - R1在100个真实可复现的CVEs上进行评估，涵盖漏洞披露的三个阶段；分析补充代码上下文和集成自适应推理策略对生成成功率的影响。

Result: LLMs利用公开数据自动生成有效PoC的比例为8% - 34%，DeepSeek - R1表现更优；补充代码上下文可提升成功率17% - 20%，函数级比文件级提升9% - 13%；集成自适应推理策略后成功率显著提升至68% - 72%；23个新生成的PoC被NVD和Exploit DB接受。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可能重塑漏洞利用的动态。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought remarkable
progress in code understanding and reasoning, creating new opportunities and
raising new concerns for software security. Among many downstream tasks,
generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in
vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous
research has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing
availability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a
natural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically
generate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of
LLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the
practical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate
GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three
stages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with
only descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day
vulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can
automatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data,
with DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that
supplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with
function-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further
integrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly
improves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape
vulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been
accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOJO作为新兴编程语言，缺乏全面测试框架和足够语料，导致大语言模型生成代码语义错误，降低模糊测试效果。

Method: 提出MOJOFuzzer框架，集成多阶段框架消除低质量输入，根据运行时反馈动态调整提示进行测试用例变异。

Result: MOJOFuzzer显著提升测试有效性、API覆盖率和漏洞检测性能，优于传统和现有方法，发现13个未知漏洞。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了大语言模型驱动的软件测试领域发展，为新兴编程语言测试提供基础方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of
diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for
improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a
high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the
efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model
scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks
comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing,
which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate
syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the
effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose
MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for
zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer
integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality
generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity.
Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime
feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that
continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our
experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test
validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming
traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches.
Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation
of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the
field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational
methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming
languages.

Result: 在安全导向的C/C++标准评估中，实现亚分钟级首次反馈，违规减少效果有竞争力，违规率更低，小范围调查显示减少分诊工作量。

Conclusion: 概述了操作经验和局限性，强调可重复性、可审计性及拓展方向。

Abstract: Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where
static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use
risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system
for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with
AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack
(quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise
explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++
standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50
build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower
violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is
decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer
independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of
reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants
reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and
limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader
standards and assisted patching.

Result: 漂移重训练在多数情况下与定期重训练有可比的预测准确性，数据快速变化时定期重训练更能保证准确性。

Conclusion: 为软件团队改进预测系统提供可行建议，可减少重训练开销并保持性能。

Abstract: Capacity management is critical for software organizations to allocate
resources effectively and meet operational demands. An important step in
capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on
data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which
require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously
retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale,
posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and
efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more
computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires
further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining
capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the
data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based
retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in
most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data
is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the
forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software
teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while
maintaining robust performance.

Motivation: 现有静态和动态分析常忽略影响不安全行为的结构依赖，需改进软件漏洞检测方法。

Method: 将程序视为异构图，结合图表示与轻量级本地大语言模型，联合拓扑特征和语义推理。

Result: 在Java漏洞检测中准确率达93.57%，比基于图注意力网络嵌入方法高8.36%，比预训练大语言模型基线高17.81%，还能提取显著子图和生成自然语言解释。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展、可解释和本地部署的工具铺平道路，推动漏洞分析向结构和语义层面转变，便于在实际安全软件开发中广泛应用。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic
analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors.
Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow
relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these
graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological
features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns
of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary
classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph
Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines
such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient
subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving
interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable,
explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis
from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights,
facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了MASs关键的鲁棒性缺陷，提供了有效缓解策略，为开发更可靠的代码生成MASs提供重要见解。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated
code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks
by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different
roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness
remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world
deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the
robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing
approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving
mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs
across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness
flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they
initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving
mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet
largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between
planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding
agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a
multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a
repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new
monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method
effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of
identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and
provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for
developing more reliable MASs for code generation.

Result: 确定四种交互策略和提示风格，学生认为有省时等好处，也存在信任降低等问题，策略和提示风格不显著影响测试有效性和代码质量。

Conclusion: 策略和提示风格对测试有效性和代码质量无显著影响。

Abstract: The integration of generative AI tools like ChatGPT into software engineering
workflows opens up new opportunities to boost productivity in tasks such as
unit test engineering. However, these AI-assisted workflows can also
significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control,
output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study
investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in
software testing interact with generative AI for engineering unit tests. Our
goal is to examine the strategies they use, how heavily they rely on generative
AI, and the benefits and challenges they perceive when using generative
AI-assisted approaches for test engineering. We conducted an observational
study involving 12 undergraduate students who worked with generative AI for
unit testing tasks. We identified four interaction strategies, defined by
whether the test idea or the test implementation originated from generative AI
or the participant. Additionally, we singled out prompting styles that focused
on one-shot or iterative test generation, which often aligned with the broader
interaction strategy. Students reported benefits including time-saving, reduced
cognitive load, and support for test ideation, but also noted drawbacks such as
diminished trust, test quality concerns, and lack of ownership. While strategy
and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics, they did not significantly
affect test effectiveness or test code quality as measured by mutation score or
test smells.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的项目级C到Rust翻译方法因缺乏全局视角难以处理指针，需改进。

Method: 构建C - Rust指针知识图谱，融入两种指针语义，结合LLM实现Ourtool进行项目级翻译。

Result: Ourtool比规则和传统LLM方法减少99.9%不安全使用，比模糊增强LLM方法功能正确性平均高29.3%。

Conclusion: Ourtool在项目级C到Rust翻译中表现出色，能生成安全、地道的Rust代码。

Abstract: Translating C code into safe Rust is an effective way to ensure its memory
safety. Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that
remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer
Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written
idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle
with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project
into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them
bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up,
unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a
global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel
C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with
two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record
global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to
higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership,
mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we
further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust
translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with
comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs
towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our
experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by
99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based
rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than
those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.

Method: 提出RepoSummary方法，可同时自动生成仓库文档，建立从功能特征到对应代码元素更准确的可追溯性链接。

Result: 对比HGEN基线实验，RepoSummary特征覆盖率更高、可追溯性更准确，完全覆盖特征率从61.2%提升到71.1%，文件级可追溯性召回率从29.9%提升到53.0%，生成文档更优。

Conclusion: RepoSummary在特征覆盖、可追溯性和文档生成方面表现出色，能帮助开发者在代码理解和维护中快速定位相关内容。

Abstract: Repository summarization is a crucial research question in development and
maintenance for software engineering. Existing repository summarization
techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree,
which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that
collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose
RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that
simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore,
it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the
corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant
methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive
experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that
RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On
average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual
documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Java的自动化程序修复（APR）研究因有Defects4J等基准测试取得进展，但C/C++程序修复研究因缺乏高质量开源基准测试存在差距。

Method: 构建包含大量bug相关提交、高质量有缺陷函数和易受攻击函数及测试用例的Defects4C基准测试，用其评估24种大语言模型。

Result: 评估结果揭示了当前基于大语言模型的APR技术在C/C++领域的优缺点。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法，Defects4C对推动未来研究至关重要。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) plays a critical role in enhancing the quality
and reliability of software systems. While substantial progress has been made
in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there
remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the
widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This
gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks
tailored for C/C++.
  To address this issue, we introduce Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable
benchmark specifically designed for C/C++ program repair. Our dataset is
constructed from real-world C/C++ repositories and includes a large collection
of bug-relevant commits (9M in total), 248 high-quality buggy functions, and
102 vulnerable functions, all paired with test cases for reproduction. These
resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the
retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance.
  Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing
C/C++ faults. Our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based APR techniques in this domain, highlighting
both the need for more robust methods and the critical role of Defects4C in
advancing future research

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DT任务方法因输入复杂异构、未充分利用标准代码，限制大语言模型解决任务的效果。

Method: 提出DebugTA，含标准代码检索、变量替换、外部编译器等工具，按教学和调试原则分解任务，利用工具调用对齐代码，引入学生模拟器 - 教师交互范式评估。

Result: 在三个真实代码数据集上实验，DebugTA持续提升教学效果，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: DebugTA有效解决了DT任务现有方法的挑战，能提升教学效果和降低成本。

Abstract: In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common
scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code.
The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages,
reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating
modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges
hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and
heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the
reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to
fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to
rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs
in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose
DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools
for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and
an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit
pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes
a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools
for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step
and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool
calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible,
allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and
improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the
quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher
interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets
demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while
significantly reducing computational costs.

TL;DR: 本文对基于基础模型的软件（FMware）开发进行大规模分析，揭示应用领域、开发者挑战和问题解决重点，为改进工具和工作流提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMware对软件工程有变革性影响，但开发面临新挑战，且缺乏跨云平台和开源仓库的大规模分析。

Method: 从GitHub仓库和领先的FMware平台收集数据，从常见应用领域、开发者遇到的关键挑战、需最大努力解决的问题类型三个方面进行实证研究。

Result: 发现FMware聚焦教育、内容创作和商业策略领域，存在内存管理等技术挑战，GitHub上常见问题是bug报告和核心功能问题，代码审查等解决耗时最长。

Conclusion: 研究揭示开发者实践和痛点，为改进FMware工具、工作流和社区支持提供机会与可行建议。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, are fundamentally transforming
the practice of software engineering by enabling the development of
\emph{FMware} -- applications and infrastructures built around these models.
FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language
interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation,
underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows.
However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present
significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise
platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of
traditional software development.
  To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware
development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We
empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the
most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers
encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to
resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading
FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings
reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy,
alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency
handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core
functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code
review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most
time-consuming to resolve.
  By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to
opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and
provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.

Motivation: Kieker可观测性框架支持语言有限，而OpenTelemetry标准支持更多语言，为利用Kieker分析能力，需将OpenTelemetry跟踪数据转换到Kieker框架。

Method: 描述将OpenTelemetry跟踪数据转换到Kieker框架的方法。

Result: 能够从OpenTelemetry的检测数据创建调用树。

Conclusion: 通过天文商店OpenTelemetry演示应用的跟踪数据可视化，证明了该方法的可用性。

Abstract: The observability framework Kieker provides a range of analysis capabilities,
but it is currently only able to instrument a smaller selection of languages
and technologies, including Java, C, Fortran, and Python. The OpenTelemetry
standard aims for providing reference implementations for most programming
languages, including C# and JavaScript, that are currently not supported by
Kieker. In this work, we describe how to transform OpenTelemetry tracing data
into the Kieker framework. Thereby, it becomes possible to create for example
call trees from OpenTelemetry instrumentations. We demonstrate the usability of
our approach by visualizing trace data of the Astronomy Shop, which is an
OpenTelemetry demo application.

Abstract: Understanding how developers interact with code generation tools (CGTs)
requires detailed, real-time data on programming behavior which is often
difficult to collect without disrupting workflow. We present
\textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed
to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code
(VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such
as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts,
enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user
workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API,
and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of
deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher}
enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich
behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development.
This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI,
developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs. Please find

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程学习中完成任务不代表理解概念，创建针对性问题繁琐，需自动生成Scratch编程理解问题。

Method: 提出30种覆盖既定程序理解模型的Scratch代码问题，扩展LitterBox工具自动生成问题。

Result: 在600,913个项目数据集上自动生成54,118,694个问题，34名九年级学生实验表明能生成有意义问题。

Conclusion: 该方法能为Scratch程序生成有意义问题，学生答题能力与整体表现相关。

Abstract: When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code
they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not
guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners
questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to
assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual
student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to
generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to
the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different
questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model,
and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate
corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913
projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial
experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed
generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the
ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to
their overall performance.

TL;DR: 提出新型SABR DNN架构，解决传统SABR模型和现有机器学习方法局限，可无套利校准市场波动率曲面和期权价格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SABR模型解析近似在高波动、长期限和价外期权时精度下降且可能存在套利，现有机器学习方法有简化SABR动态或缺乏系统验证问题。

Method: 开发SABR DNN，用超2亿点的利率Cap/Floor波动率曲面大训练数据集学习真实SABR随机动态，数据集通过高精度无偏蒙特卡罗模拟特殊缩放平移SABR随机动态获得。

Result: SABR DNN可无套利校准真实市场波动率曲面和期权价格，计算量小且无需跨交易日重新训练。

Conclusion: 结果系统解决先前文献差距，可扩展到不同利率期限和货币的欧式期权，建立可用于日常交易和风险管理的综合SABR框架。

Abstract: The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its
practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan
et al., whose accuracy deteriorates for high volatility, long maturities, and
out-of-the-money options, admitting arbitrage. While machine learning
approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often
been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation
against the full spectrum of market conditions.
  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network
(DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an
unprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest
rate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and
extreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained
via high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled
shifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without
any loss of generality.
  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility
surfaces and Caps/Floors prices for any maturity and strike with negligible
computational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results
fully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a
systematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest
rate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus
establishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for
daily trading and risk management activities.

Conclusion: 强化学习算法是动态交易环境中有效集成异质信号的有前途的方法。

Abstract: This research develops a sentiment-driven quantitative trading system that
leverages a large language model, FinGPT, for sentiment analysis, and explores
a novel method for signal integration using a reinforcement learning algorithm,
Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). We compare the
performance of strategies that integrate sentiment and technical signals using
both a conventional rule-based approach and a reinforcement learning framework.
The results suggest that sentiment signals generated by FinGPT offer value when
combined with traditional technical indicators, and that reinforcement learning
algorithm presents a promising approach for effectively integrating
heterogeneous signals in dynamic trading environments.

Result: 2018 - 2024年回测美国股票年化收益率达34.13%，泛化能力强，预测泡沫期保守可减少误判。

Conclusion: 该方法结合理论和实证进展，可利用HLPPL信号实时识别和测量正负泡沫。

Abstract: We propose a novel model, the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model (HLPPL), to
the problem of quantifying and detecting financial bubbles, an ever-fascinating
one for academics and practitioners alike. Bubble labels are generated using a
Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, sentiment scores, and a hype index we
introduced in previous research on NLP forecasting of stock return volatility.
Using these tools, a dual-stream transformer model is trained with market data
and machine learning methods, resulting in a time series of confidence scores
as a Bubble Score. A distinctive feature of our framework is that it captures
phases of extreme overpricing and underpricing within a unified structure.
  We achieve an average yield of 34.13 percentage annualized return when
backtesting U.S. equities during the period 2018 to 2024, while the approach
exhibits a remarkable generalization ability across industry sectors. Its
conservative bias in predicting bubble periods minimizes false positives, a
feature which is especially beneficial for market signaling and
decision-making. Overall, this approach utilizes both theoretical and empirical
advances for real-time positive and negative bubble identification and
measurement with HLPPL signals.

Motivation: 解决含劳动收入情况下，在年龄相关死亡率下，代理人最大化消费和劳动收入效用的最优年金化问题。

Method: 采用动态规划方法。

Result: 退休前投资行为随财富增加直至劳动供给设定的阈值；退休后倾向消费更多财富；年金化决策受个人贴现率和保险公司赔付率影响；高龄时年金化因死亡率抵免激励而最优；退休后劳动收入可替代年金。

Conclusion: 高龄时年金化是最优选择，退休后劳动收入能增强退休人员财务安全。

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal annuitization with labour income, where an
agent aims to maximize utility from consumption and labour income under
age-dependent force of mortality. Using a dynamic programming approach, we
derive closed-form solutions for the value function and the optimal
consumption, portfolio, and labor supply strategies. Our results show that
before retirement, investment behavior increases with wealth until a threshold
set by labor supply. After retirement, agents tend to consume a larger portion
of their wealth. Two main factors influence optimal annuitization decisions as
people get older. First, the agent's perspective (demand side); the agent's
personal discount rate rises with age, reducing their desire to annuitize.
Second, the insurer's perspective (supply side); insurers offer higher payout
rates (mortality credits). Our model demonstrates that beyond a certain age,
sharply declining survival probabilities make annuitization substantially
optimal, as the powerful incentive of mortality credits outweighs the agent's
high personal discount rate. Finally, post-retirement labor income serves as a
direct substitute for annuitization by providing an alternative stable income
source. It enhances the financial security of retirees.

Result: 不同条件下，上证综指和纽交所综指股票的年化收益率表现不同；纽交所综指股票月回报率与p - 指数有正线性关系，上证综指无；纽交所综指股票传统五因子模型表现差，加入p - 指数有增量信息。

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: The empirical results have shown that firstly, with one-week holding period
and reinvesting, for SSE Composite Index stocks, the highest p-ratio investment
strategy produces the largest annualized rate of return; and for NYSE Composite
Index stocks, all the three strategies with both one-week and one-month periods
generate negative returns. Secondly, with non-reinvesting, for SSE Composite
Index stocks, the highest p-ratio strategy with one-week holding period yields
the largest annualized rate of return; and for NYSE Composite stocks, the
one-week EEF strategy produces a medium annualized return. Thirdly, under the
one-week EEF investment strategy, for NYSE Composite Index stocks, the right
frontier yields a higher annualized return, but for SSE Composite Index stocks,
the left frontier (stocks on the empirical efficient frontier) yields a higher
annualized return than the right frontier. Fourthly, for NYSE Composite Index
stocks, there is a positive linear relationship between monthly return and the
p-index, but no such relationship is evident for SSE Composite Index stocks.
Fifthly, for NYSE Composite Index stocks, the traditional five-factor model
performs poorly, and adding the p-index as a sixth factor provides incremental
information.

Motivation: 研究基于CP - AMM的链上清算的毒性条件，明确动态清算激励对螺旋风险的影响。

Method: 先推导固定清算激励下的毒性边界，再使用动态健康关联清算激励获得状态相关边界。

Result: 对于固定清算激励，毒性边界收紧；使用动态激励，得到状态相关边界和仅与流动性深度有关的条件。

Conclusion: 动态清算激励能调和与CP - AMM价格的影响，明确其何时降低或加剧螺旋风险。

Abstract: We derive a slippage-aware toxicity condition for on-chain liquidations
executed via a constant-product automated market maker (CP-AMM). For a fixed
(constant) liquidation incentive $i$, the familiar toxicity frontier $\nu <
1/(1+i)$ tightens to $\nu < 1/((1+i)\lambda)$ for a liquidity penalty factor
$\lambda$ that we derive for both the CP-AMM and a generalised form. Using a
dynamic health-linked liquidation incentive $i(h) = i(1 - h)$, we obtain a
state-dependent bound and, at the liquidation boundary, a liquidity-depth-only
condition $\nu < 1/\lambda$. This reconciles dynamic incentives with the impact
of the CP-AMM price and clarifies when dynamic liquidation incentives reduce
versus exacerbate spiral risk.

Motivation: 稳定币融入支付结算系统带来新的系统性风险，尤其是市场压力时期的流动性风险。

Method: 开发一种将法币支持的稳定币嵌入央行锚定框架的混合货币架构，结合100%准备金支持、可互操作的赎回途径和常备流动性便利。

Result: 以2023年SVB USDC脱钩事件为压力场景，该架构减少了峰值挂钩偏差，缩短了压力持续时间，稳定了高赎回强度下的赎回队列。

Conclusion: 该混合稳定币 - CBDC架构增强了系统弹性，维护了货币完整性，为稳定币融入受监管金融体系提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Stablecoins have emerged as a significant component of global financial
infrastructure, with aggregate market capitalization surpassing USD250 billion
in 2025. Their increasing integration into payment and settlement systems has
simultaneously introduced novel channels of systemic exposure, particularly
liquidity risk during periods of market stress. This study develops a hybrid
monetary architecture that embeds fiat-backed stablecoins within a central
bank-anchored framework to structurally mitigate liquidity fragility. The
proposed model combines 100 percent reserve backing, interoperable redemption
rails, and standing liquidity facilities to guarantee instant convertibility at
par. Using the 2023 SVB USDC de-peg event as a calibrated stress scenario, we
demonstrate that this architecture reduces peak peg deviations, shortens stress
persistence, and stabilizes redemption queues under high redemption intensity.
By integrating liquidity backstops and eliminating maturity-transformation
channels, the framework addresses run dynamics ex ante rather than through ad
hoc intervention. These findings provide empirical and theoretical support for
a hybrid stablecoin-CBDC architecture that enhances systemic resilience,
preserves monetary integrity, and establishes a credible pathway for stablecoin
integration into regulated financial systems.

Result: 建立了后悔界，分解为标准老虎机项和反映预训练模型质量的额外项；在独立同分布上下文且特征为Hölder - 光滑缺失情况下，PULSE - UCB达近最优性能并有匹配下界。

Conclusion: 量化了预测上下文的不确定性对决策质量的影响，以及改善下游学习所需的历史数据量。

Abstract: The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate
predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to
incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We
study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where
contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In
addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing
fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected
without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that
leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing
features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that
decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting
pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\"older-smooth
missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by
matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted
contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to
improve downstream learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型常存在校准错误，即采样分布的类概率和其他统计量与期望值存在偏差。

Method: 将校准问题构建为约束优化问题，引入松弛损失（用校准错误惩罚替代约束）和奖励损失（将校准转化为奖励微调问题）两种替代目标进行微调。

Result: 这些方法在数百个同时存在的约束和高达十亿参数的模型上，显著降低了校准误差，涵盖蛋白质设计、图像生成和语言建模等应用。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种替代目标微调方法能有效解决生成模型的校准问题。

Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class
probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from
desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and
seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration
constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints
exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax
loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the
reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We
demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across
hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion
parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and
language modeling.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于核的自适应数据收集下分布推断框架，结合双重稳健得分与方差稳定化，实验表明其效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应实验打破经典渐近性的独立同分布假设，且很多感兴趣的问题是分布性的，现有核处理效应方法需适配自适应数据收集。

Method: 结合双重稳健得分与方差稳定化，通过希尔伯特空间鞅中心极限定理确保渐近正态性，引入样本拟合稳定化检验。

Result: 实验显示该方法校准良好，对均值偏移和高阶矩差异都有效，优于仅适用于标量效应的自适应基线。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于核的框架能在自适应数据收集下进行有效的分布推断。

Abstract: Adaptive experiments improve efficiency by adjusting treatment assignments
based on past outcomes, but this adaptivity breaks the i.i.d. assumptions that
underpins classical asymptotics. At the same time, many questions of interest
are distributional, extending beyond average effects. Kernel treatment effects
(KTE) provide a flexible framework by representing counterfactual outcome
distributions in an RKHS and comparing them via kernel distances. We present
the first kernel-based framework for distributional inference under adaptive
data collection. Our method combines doubly robust scores with variance
stabilization to ensure asymptotic normality via a Hilbert-space martingale
CLT, and introduces a sample-fitted stabilized test with valid type-I error.
Experiments show it is well calibrated and effective for both mean shifts and
higher-moment differences, outperforming adaptive baselines limited to scalar
effects.

Motivation: 现有切断反馈方法存在计算挑战，变分推理切断反馈方法需两次变分近似且要访问上游数据和模型，因此需要更优方法。

Method: NeVI - Cut直接利用上游样本，用归一化流指定下游参数的条件变分族，通过蒙特卡罗平均损失估计条件切断后验。

Conclusion: NeVI - Cut相比传统切断反馈方法有显著计算优势，比参数变分切断方法更准确。

Abstract: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier
(upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian
analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,
achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents
backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally
challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two
variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.
In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural
network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly
utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the
upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis
and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for
the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional
variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional
cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all
the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut
estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data
regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution,
quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the
target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we
establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of
conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses
illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over
traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than
parametric variational cut approaches.

Motivation: 解决共形预测在实践中存在的预测区域确定近似、计算成本高和区域形状难控制三个挑战。

Method: 研究非一致性度量单调性、似然函数单调性和共形预测区域精确确定之间的关系，基于此提出简单策略。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 提出可同时缓解共形预测三个挑战的简单策略。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-free machine learning method for creating
prediction regions with a guaranteed coverage probability level. However, a
data scientist often faces three challenges in practice: (i) the determination
of a conformal prediction region is only approximate, jeopardizing the
finite-sample validity of prediction, (ii) the computation required could be
prohibitively expensive, and (iii) the shape of a conformal prediction region
is hard to control. This article offers new insights into the relationship
among the monotonicity of the non-conformity measure, the monotonicity of the
plausibility function, and the exact determination of a conformal prediction
region. Based on these new insights, we propose a simple strategy to alleviate
the three challenges simultaneously.

Result: 发现STE训练泛化误差先平稳后骤降，平稳期长度与量化范围有关，量化网络与未量化线性模型的渐近偏差可量化。

Conclusion: 揭示了量化超参数对量化神经网络学习动态的影响，扩展了相关分析技术。

Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable
objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through
surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily
focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the
influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization
range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show
that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic
ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a
plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length
depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the
asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend
analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear
transformations of weights and inputs.

Result: 通过网格世界实验，在不同类型缺失情况下，为多插补路径可作为构建简单高效在线缺失数据强化学习方法的有用框架提供了初步证据。

Conclusion: 多插补路径可能是构建简单高效在线缺失数据强化学习方法的有用框架。

Abstract: Missing data in online reinforcement learning (RL) poses challenges compared
to missing data in standard tabular data or in offline policy learning. The
need to impute and act at each time step means that imputation cannot be put
off until enough data exist to produce stable imputation models. It also means
future data collection and learning depend on previous imputations. This paper
proposes fully online imputation ensembles. We find that maintaining multiple
imputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under
missingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider
multiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action
selection. Using a Grid World experiment with various types of missingness, we
provide preliminary evidence that multiple imputation pathways may be a useful
framework for constructing simple and efficient online missing data RL methods.

Result: 通过合成数据实验验证框架能评估模型充分性、量化数据集内在复杂度和揭示序列数据可解释结构。

Conclusion: 时间模式的有无从根本上限制了序列模型的可学习性，最优预测器也无法超越数据的内在信息限制。

Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language -
has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these
algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their
identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these
patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased
generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving
pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between
the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and
feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework
based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the
past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines
an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of
predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this
formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns
fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal
predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the
data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data,
demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent
complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.

### [434] [Quantifying Dataset Similarity to Guide Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10866)
*Shudong Sun,Hao Helen Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出Cross - Learning Score (CLS) 度量数据集相似度以指导迁移学习的数据选择，实验证明其能可靠预测迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迁移学习中使用不匹配数据会损害性能，现有方法多关注特征分布而忽略标签信息和预测关系，需要一种新方法判断迁移是否有益。

Method: 提出CLS度量，通过领域间双向泛化性能衡量数据集相似度，建立其与决策边界余弦相似度的理论联系，引入框架根据CLS划分源数据集迁移区域，并将方法扩展到深度学习的编码器 - 头部架构。

Result: CLS计算高效，能可靠预测迁移学习性能是提升还是下降。

Conclusion: CLS为迁移学习的数据选择提供了一种有原则的工具。

Abstract: Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it
can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve
learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm
rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the
transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address
this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity
and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,
existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label
information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical
transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning
Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization
performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by
establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision
boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is
efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive
distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a
general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or
negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error,
enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to
encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer
pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks
demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or
degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in
transfer learning.

Result: 理论推导均方误差率上界，模拟显示对标准随机森林有效，在ICU患者死亡率预测有显著收益。

Conclusion: 该方法在迁移学习中有优势，距离协方差权重在某些情况下对随机森林性能有益。

Abstract: Random forest is an important method for ML applications due to its broad
outperformance over competing methods for structured tabular data. We propose a
method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered
random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming
the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few
features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from
predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF.
Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting
probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the
features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound
on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes
and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning
benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained
for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method
with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results
also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance
of RF in some situations. Our method shows significant gains in predicting the
mortality of ICU patients in smaller-bed target hospitals using a large
multi-hospital dataset of electronic health records for 200,000 ICU patients.

Motivation: 为上下文学习（ICL）建立有限样本统计理论。

Method: 在元学习框架下分析，引入风险分解，将总ICL风险分为贝叶斯差距和后验方差两部分。

Result: 得出均匀注意力Transformer贝叶斯差距的非渐近上界，明确其与预训练提示数量和上下文长度的关系；后验方差仅由真实潜在任务难度决定，任务混合的不确定性随少量上下文示例指数级快速消失。

Conclusion: Transformer在预训练时选择最优元算法，在测试时快速收敛到真实任务的最优算法，为ICL提供统一视角。

Abstract: This paper develops a finite-sample statistical theory for in-context
learning (ICL), analyzed within a meta-learning framework that accommodates
mixtures of diverse task types. We introduce a principled risk decomposition
that separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and
Posterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model
approximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention
Transformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which
explicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and
their context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk
representing the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term
is determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the
uncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only
a few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of
ICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and
rapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.

TL;DR: 提出单阶段学习 - 延迟（L2D）的对抗鲁棒性框架，经实验验证可提升对抗攻击的鲁棒性并保留干净性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有L2D易受对抗扰动影响，且先前鲁棒性分析仅关注两阶段设置，单阶段情况待研究。

Method: 引入单阶段L2D的对抗鲁棒性框架，形式化攻击，提出成本敏感的对抗替代损失，并建立理论保证。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，方法能提升对无目标和有目标攻击的鲁棒性，同时保留干净性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效提升了单阶段L2D在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables hybrid decision-making by routing inputs
either to a predictor or to external experts. While promising, L2D is highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which can not only flip predictions
but also manipulate deferral decisions. Prior robustness analyses focus solely
on two-stage settings, leaving open the end-to-end (one-stage) case where
predictor and allocation are trained jointly. We introduce the first framework
for adversarial robustness in one-stage L2D, covering both classification and
regression. Our approach formalizes attacks, proposes cost-sensitive
adversarial surrogate losses, and establishes theoretical guarantees including
$\mathcal{H}$, $(\mathcal{R }, \mathcal{F})$, and Bayes consistency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that our methods improve robustness
against untargeted and targeted attacks while preserving clean performance.

Result: 得到新的风险度量及其泛化界，设计出算法

Conclusion: 提出的方法在子组层面有保障，实证证明方法有用

Abstract: PAC generalization bounds on the risk, when expressed in terms of the
expected loss, are often insufficient to capture imbalances between subgroups
in the data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new family of risk
measures, called constrained f-entropic risk measures, which enable finer
control over distributional shifts and subgroup imbalances via f-divergences,
and include the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure. We
derive both classical and disintegrated PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for
this family of risks, providing the first disintegratedPAC-Bayesian guarantees
beyond standard risks. Building on this theory, we design a self-bounding
algorithm that minimizes our bounds directly, yielding models with guarantees
at the subgroup level. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of
our approach.

Abstract: High-dimensional regression often suffers from heavy-tailed noise and
outliers, which can severely undermine the reliability of least-squares based
methods. To improve robustness, we adopt a non-smooth Wilcoxon score based rank
objective and incorporate structured group sparsity regularization, a natural
generalization of the lasso, yielding a group lasso regularized rank regression
method. By extending the tuning-free parameter selection scheme originally
developed for the lasso, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-based tuning
rule and further establish a finite-sample error bound for the resulting
estimator. On the computational side, we develop a proximal augmented
Lagrangian method for solving the associated optimization problem, which
eliminates the singularity issues encountered in existing methods, thereby
enabling efficient semismooth Newton updates for the subproblems. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
proposed estimator against alternatives, and showcase the scalability of the
algorithm across both simulated and real-data settings.

Abstract: The recent advancements in mathematical modeling of biochemical systems have
generated increased interest in sensitivity analysis methodologies. There are
two primary approaches for analyzing these mathematical models: the stochastic
approach, which employs chemical master equations (CME), and the deterministic
approach, which utilizes ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The
intractable discrete states present in most biochemical processes render the
direct simulation of the CME infeasible. Moment closure approximations are
recognized for their numerical efficiency in estimating the statistics of the
CME solution. Since classical sensitivity analysis is not directly applicable
to stochastic modeling, this work conducts sensitivity analysis using
moment-based ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to identify key parameters
that significantly influence the dynamics of the model. We conduct numerical
tests to evaluate the effectiveness of both local and global sensitivity
analyses of the moment-based ODEs. These tests enable us to examine how
variations in input parameters influence the model's output.

Abstract: Spline interpolation is a widely used class of methods for solving
interpolation problems by constructing smooth interpolants that minimize a
regularized energy functional involving the Laplacian operator. While many
existing approaches focus on Euclidean domains or the sphere, relying on the
spectral properties of the Laplacian, this work introduces a method for spline
interpolation on general manifolds by exploiting its equivalence with kriging.
Specifically, the proposed approach uses finite element approximations of
random fields defined over the manifold, based on Gaussian Markov Random Fields
and a discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a triangulated mesh.
This framework enables the modeling of spatial fields with local anisotropies
through domain deformation. The method is first validated on the sphere using
both analytical test cases and a pollution-related study, and is compared to
the classical spherical harmonics-based method. Additional experiments on the
surface of a cylinder further illustrate the generality of the approach.

### [444] [AI-assisted Programming May Decrease the Productivity of Experienced Developers by Increasing Maintenance Burden](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10165)
*Feiyang,Xu,Poonacha K. Medappa,Murat M. Tunc,Martijn Vroegindeweij,Jan C. Fransoo*

TL;DR: 分析GitHub Copilot引入后开源项目开发者活动，发现生产力提升但AI代码需更多返工，经验丰富开发者负担加重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究未明确生成式AI代码质量及维护挑战，若质量随产量下降，有经验开发者审查和返工工作量会增加。

Method: 分析GitHub Copilot引入后开源软件项目中的开发者活动。

Result: 生产力提升主要由经验不足开发者推动，采用AI后编写的代码需更多返工，有经验开发者审查代码增加6.5%，原创代码生产力下降19%。

Conclusion: AI带来的生产力提升可能掩盖了专家维护负担的增加，需谨慎对待。

Abstract: Generative AI solutions like GitHub Copilot have been shown to increase the
productivity of software developers. Yet prior work remains unclear on the
quality of code produced and the challenges of maintaining it in software
projects. If quality declines as volume grows, experienced developers face
increased workloads reviewing and reworking code from less-experienced
contributors. We analyze developer activity in Open Source Software (OSS)
projects following the introduction of GitHub Copilot. We find that
productivity indeed increases. However, the increase in productivity is
primarily driven by less-experienced (peripheral) developers. We also find that
code written after the adoption of AI requires more rework. Importantly, the
added rework burden falls on the more experienced (core) developers, who review
6.5% more code after Copilot's introduction, but show a 19% drop in their
original code productivity. More broadly, this finding raises caution that
productivity gains of AI may mask the growing burden of maintenance on a
shrinking pool of experts.

*Mahdi Goldani*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文提出新的时间序列相似性方法，比较伊朗与地区同行的创新趋势，发现伊朗创新与社会发展动态联系更紧密。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创新对国家发展战略至关重要，但衡量和比较各国创新绩效存在方法学挑战，因此开展研究。

Method: 设计整合STL与快速DTW的时间序列相似性方法，用研发支出占GDP比例作代理指标，基于世界银行指标和自编码器插补技术处理缺失值。

Result: 贫困和健康指标与伊朗研发支出统计相似性最强，沙特阿拉伯、阿曼和科威特与伊朗跨国接近度最高。

Conclusion: 伊朗创新与社会发展动态内在联系更紧密，对科技政策有地区特定影响。

Abstract: Innovation is becoming ever more pivotal to national development strategies
but measuring and comparing innovation performance across nations is still a
methodological challenges. This research devises a new time-series similarity
method that integrates Seasonal-Trend decomposition (STL) with Fast Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) to examine Irans innovation trends by comparison with its
regional peers. Owing to data availability constraints of Global Innovation
Index data , research and development spending as a proportion of GDP is used
as a proxy with its limitations clearly noted. Based on World Bank indicators
and an Autoencoder based imputation technique for missing values, the research
compares cross-country similarities and determines theme domains best aligned
with Irans innovation path. Findings indicate that poverty and health metrics
manifest the strongest statistical similarity with R and D spending in Iran,
while Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait show the most similar cross country
proximity. Implications are that Iranian innovation is more intrinsically
connected with social development dynamics rather than conventional economic or
infrastructure drivers, with region-specific implications for STI policy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究印度继承权对女性赋权的影响。

Method: 采用准自然实验框架，运用双重差分策略，结合三角测量法确定女性赋权指标，使用印度人类发展调查数据。

Result: 对婚姻选择、亲密伴侣暴力、身体和公民自主权有积极影响，对家庭自主权有负面影响，对经济参与无显著影响，不同社会经济地位、地区、父权程度和户主性别群体影响有差异。

Conclusion: 继承法的影响在不同群体中并不一致。

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of inheritance rights on women' empowerment
in India. We employ the quasi-natural experiment framework wherein; five states
amended the Hindu Succession Act (HSA) from 1976 to 1994 before it was
federally amended in 2005. Further, we apply difference-in-difference (DID)
strategy and consider triangulation approach to identify women empowerment
indicators namely: access to resources, agency, and outcomes to measure varying
dimensions of empowerment. Using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-I),
our results indicate a positive impact on marriage choice, intimate partner
violence, physical, and civil autonomy. However, negative impact on household
autonomy and no significant on economic participation for women exposed to
state amendments. Further, exploring the heterogeneities in terms of
socio-economic status, location, level of patriarchy in a state, gender of the
head of the household. Overall, the study highlights that the impact of
inheritance law is not unfirm across different groups.

Motivation: 探究农业经济体家庭在即时生产需求和长期人力资本投资间的权衡，研究外生农业生产力冲击对卢旺达中小学入学率的影响。

Method: 使用2010 - 2021年地区层面面板数据，采用两阶段最小二乘法（2SLS）工具变量策略，用年降雨量变化作为植被健康和农业生产力指标的工具变量。

Result: 小学入学率逆周期，男生对冲击更敏感；中学入学率顺周期，持续正向冲击后女生中学入学率下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了“女孩作为缓冲”假设，揭示了对经济冲击持续性的动态和性别化响应。

Abstract: This paper investigates the trade-off that households in agrarian economies
face between immediate production needs and long-term human capital investment.
We ask how exogenous agricultural productivity shocks affect primary and
secondary school enrollment in Rwanda, a country characterized by a heavy
reliance on rain-fed agriculture alongside ambitious development goals. Using a
district-level panel dataset for the years 2010-2021, we employ a two-stage
least squares (2SLS) instrumental variable strategy. Plausibly exogenous
variation in annual rainfall is used to instrument for a satellite-derived
measure of vegetation health and agricultural productivity, the Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), allowing for a causal interpretation of the
results. For primary education, where direct costs are low, enrollment is
countercyclical: positive productivity shocks are associated with lower
enrollment. Notably, boys' primary enrollment is found to be significantly more
elastic to these shocks than girls' enrollment. Conversely, for secondary
education, which entails additional financial outlays, enrollment is strongly
procyclical. Positive productivity shocks lead to significant increases in
enrollment. Further, a sustained positive shock is associated with a subsequent
decline in female secondary enrollment. The results challenge previous regional
findings supporting the "girls as a buffer" hypothesis and investigate the
dynamic and gendered responses to the persistence of economic shocks.

Motivation: 研究欧元区金融冲击的动态分配效应。

Method: 使用调查微数据，分解个人收入为金融和劳动部分，采用非线性模型框架。

Result: 正金融冲击增加不平等，通过金融和劳动收入渠道；正负冲击有不对称效应，中等收入群体仅受负冲击影响。

Conclusion: 金融冲击对不同收入群体有不同影响，存在非对称效应和群体脆弱性差异。

Abstract: We estimate the dynamic distributional effects of financial shocks in the
Euro Area using survey-based microdata on personal incomes. We find that
positive financial shocks increase inequality, with heterogeneity across
different income groups. Much of the response emerges in the tails of the
income distribution. By decomposing individual incomes into financial and labor
components, we identify two distinct transmission mechanisms: financial income
inequality rises, likely due to differences in asset holdings. In contrast,
labor income inequality increases through a skill premium channel. We then
consider a nonlinear model framework, distinguishing the sign of the shock,
allowing us to document the presence of asymmetric effects. While positive
shocks lead to income disparities, adverse shocks have the opposite effect.
Notably, middle-income groups are only affected following a negative shock,
highlighting differential vulnerabilities across the income distribution.

### [449] [List Decoding Reed--Solomon Codes in the Lee, Euclidean, and Other Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11453)
*Chris Peikert,Alexandra Veliche Hostetler*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science
and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational
complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on
efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated
Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are
focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the
number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other
metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more
appropriate.
  This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized)
Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 < p
\leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean
($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for
correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all
decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds
on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural
subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a
unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our
algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show
that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case
error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).

Motivation: 深度学习在通信系统应用日益受关注，FF学习是BP算法的高效替代方案，有诸多优势，因此研究其在通信系统中的应用。

Method: 使用FF算法设计端到端学习的自动编码器，对加性高斯白噪声和瑞利块衰落信道进行数值评估。

Result: FF训练的系统在联合编码调制以及固定非可微调制阶段场景中，与BP训练系统具有竞争力；FF网络在设计原则、训练收敛行为上有特点，且相比BP方法节省内存和处理时间。

Conclusion: FF算法在通信系统自动编码器设计中具有应用潜力，能在性能上与BP算法竞争，并具备一些优势。

Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has
been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning
is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the
typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several
advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be
differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial
derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we
design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically
evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh
block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained
systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a
fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide
further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training
convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings
compared to BP-based approaches.

Motivation: 现有绝热量子优化方法无法利用平滑问题最优解信息，基于门的量子优化热启动策略未将连续解见解融入QUBO公式。

Method: 构建紧凑希尔伯特空间，将搜索空间限制在连续最优解附近的离散解。

Result: 在软件求解器和D-Wave Advantage量子退火器上的实验显示，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的新方法在组合优化问题上具有优势，能有效减少所需量子比特并提升性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization with a smooth and convex objective function arises
naturally in applications such as discrete mean-variance portfolio
optimization, where assets must be traded in integer quantities. Although
optimal solutions to the associated smooth problem can be computed efficiently,
existing adiabatic quantum optimization methods cannot leverage this
information. Moreover, while various warm-starting strategies have been
proposed for gate-based quantum optimization, none of them explicitly integrate
insights from the relaxed continuous solution into the QUBO formulation. In
this work, a novel approach is introduced that restricts the search space to
discrete solutions in the vicinity of the continuous optimum by constructing a
compact Hilbert space, thereby reducing the number of required qubits.
Experiments on software solvers and a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多量子设备在应用双量子比特门时有约束，现有研究多考虑线性最近邻（LNN）架构，而当前设备有更复杂的图结构，需一种通用方法构建QFT算法的量子电路。

Method: 提出一种适用于任意连通图的方法，以最小化电路中CNOT门的数量。

Result: 与针对特定图优化的现有量子电路对比，该通用方法在“sun”和“two joint suns”架构上有类似结果，在LNN架构上CNOT门略多。

Conclusion: 该通用方法能为任意连通图构建电路，具有一定的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: In the paper, we consider quantum circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform
(QFT) algorithm. The QFT algorithm is a very popular technique used in many
quantum algorithms. We present a generic method for constructing quantum
circuits for this algorithm implementing on quantum devices with restrictions.
Many quantum devices (for example, based on superconductors) have restrictions
on applying two-qubit gates. These restrictions are presented by a qubit
connectivity graph. Typically, researchers consider only the linear nearest
neighbor (LNN) architecture of the qubit connection, but current devices have
more complex graphs. We present a method for arbitrary connected graphs that
minimizes the number of CNOT gates in the circuit for implementing on such
architecture.
  We compare quantum circuits built by our algorithm with existing quantum
circuits optimized for specific graphs that are Linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN)
architecture, ``sun'' (a cycle with tails, presented by the 16-qubit IBMQ
device) and ``two joint suns'' (two joint cycles with tails, presented by the
27-qubit IBMQ device). Our generic method gives similar results with existing
optimized circuits for ``sun'' and ``two joint suns'' architectures, and a
circuit with slightly more CNOT gates for the LNN architecture. At the same
time, our method allows us to construct a circuit for arbitrary connected
graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为可靠的大规模量子计算，需有效解决物理错误以保护逻辑信息，利用深度学习提升量子纠错可靠性。

Method: 提出HQMT框架，先在相关稳定子组上局部计算注意力，再合并以构建错误综合征全局视图，在变压器架构中集成专用量子比特合并层。

Result: HQMT在表面码上显著降低逻辑错误率，在不同码距下优于先前神经网络解码器和BP + OSD基线。

Conclusion: 该分层方法为表面码解码提供可扩展有效框架，推动可靠量子计算实现。

Abstract: For reliable large-scale quantum computation, a quantum error correction
(QEC) scheme must effectively resolve physical errors to protect logical
information. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based
decoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of
QEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and
general decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of
stabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our
architecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of
stabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations
to build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves
substantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a
dedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across
various code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural
network-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with
ordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach
provides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding,
advancing the realization of reliable quantum computing.

TL;DR: 提出基于超维计算的DoA估计器HYPERDOA，比现有方法更准确节能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典DoA估计方法在低信噪比下精度不足，深度学习方法能耗高且不透明，不适用于资源受限和安全关键系统。

Method: 引入Mean Spatial - Lag Autocorrelation和Spatial Smoothing两种特征提取策略，将DoA估计转化为模式识别问题，利用超维计算的抗噪性和透明代数运算。

Result: 在低信噪比、相干源场景下，精度比现有方法高约35.39%，在嵌入式平台上能耗比竞争的神经网络基线低约93%。

Conclusion: HYPERDOA在准确性和效率上有双重优势，是边缘设备关键任务应用的可靠可行解决方案。

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off,
as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too
energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems.
We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing
(HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies --
Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline,
and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This
approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent
algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and
``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our
evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it
also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and
efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for
mission-critical applications on edge devices.

Abstract: The highly non-convex optimization landscape of modern lens design
necessitates extensive human expertise, resulting in inefficiency and
constrained design diversity. While automated methods are desirable, existing
approaches remain limited to simple tasks or produce complex lenses with
suboptimal image quality. Drawing inspiration from the synaptic pruning
mechanism in mammalian neural development, this study proposes OptiNeuro--a
novel automated lens design framework that first generates diverse initial
structures and then progressively eliminates low-performance lenses while
refining remaining candidates through gradient-based optimization. By fully
automating the design of complex aspheric imaging lenses, OptiNeuro
demonstrates quasi-human-level performance, identifying multiple viable
candidates with minimal human intervention. This advancement not only enhances
the automation level and efficiency of lens design but also facilitates the
exploration of previously uncharted lens architectures.

Abstract: Recently, multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) has been successfully
applied to many engineering design optimization problems, where the cost of
high-fidelity simulations and experiments can be prohibitive. However,
challenges remain for constrained optimization problems using the MFBO
framework, particularly in efficiently identifying the feasible region defined
by the constraints. In this paper, we propose a constrained multi-fidelity
Bayesian optimization (CMFBO) method with novel acquisition functions.
Specifically, we design efficient acquisition functions that 1) have
analytically closed-form expressions; 2) are straightforward to implement; and
3) do not require feasible initial samples, an important feature often missing
in commonly used acquisition functions such as expected constrained improvement
(ECI). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on synthetic test
problems using different combinations of acquisition functions. Then, we apply
the proposed method to a data-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) design
problem, and a high-current joint design problem using finite element
simulations with computational contact mechanics.

Conclusion: FB - C2CNet有很强的实际算子学习任务应用潜力。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for approximating
solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) and other
functional mappings. \textcolor{red}{}{Classical approaches} typically adopt a
pointwise-to-pointwise framework, where input functions are sampled at
prescribed locations and mapped directly to solution values. We propose the
Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network (FB-C2CNet), which
learns operators in the coefficient space induced by prescribed basis
functions. In this framework, the input function is projected onto a fixed set
of basis functions (e.g., random features or finite element bases), and the
neural operator predicts the coefficients of the solution function in the same
or another basis. By decoupling basis selection from network training,
FB-C2CNet reduces training complexity, enables systematic analysis of how basis
choice affects approximation accuracy, and clarifies what properties of
coefficient spaces (such as effective rank and coefficient variations) are
critical for generalization. Numerical experiments on Darcy flow, Poisson
equations in regular, complex, and high-dimensional domains, and elasticity
problems demonstrate that FB-C2CNet achieves high accuracy and computational
efficiency, showing its strong potential for practical operator learning tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing
discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine
how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data
analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities
through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential
equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond
training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in
billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and
expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain
knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding
models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods
offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural
architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data
efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network
structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based
inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian
distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level
cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale
neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning
effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance
large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -
Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation
models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for
research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical
applications.

Abstract: Bounding the queue length in a multiserver queue is a central challenge in
queueing theory. Even for the classic $GI/GI/n$ queue with homogeneous servers,
it is highly non-trivial to derive a simple and accurate bound for the
steady-state queue length that holds across all scaling regimes. A recent
breakthrough by Li and Goldberg (2025) establishes bounds that scale as
$1/(1-\rho)$ for any load $\rho < 1$ and number of servers $n$, which is the
correct scaling in many well-known scaling regimes, including classic
heavy-traffic, Halfin-Whitt and Nondegenerate-Slowdown. However, their bounds
entail large constant factors and a highly intricate proof, suggesting room for
further improvement.
  In this paper, we present a new $1/(1-\rho)$-scaling bound for the $GI/GI/n$
queue. Our bound, while restricted to the light-tailed case and the first
moment of the queue length, has a more interpretable and often tighter leading
constant. Our proof is relatively simple, utilizing a modified $GI/GI/n$ queue,
the stationarity of a quadratic test function, and a novel leave-one-out
coupling technique.
  Finally, we also extend our method to $GI/GI/n$ queues with fully
heterogeneous service-time distributions.

### [460] [ROBOPSY PL[AI]: Using Role-Play to Investigate how LLMs Present Collective Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09874)

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文展示艺术研究项目的初步成果，研究大语言模型如何策划和呈现集体记忆，通过公共装置中的角色扮演游戏进行研究，有定性和定量分析结果，还为分析大语言模型性能及传播研究成果提供新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何策划和呈现集体记忆。

Method: 在公共装置中让游客与五个不同大语言模型进行角色扮演游戏，收集互动协议和玩家反馈，对大语言模型生成的文本进行自然语言处理的定量分析。

Result: 定性分析区分出三种不同类型的用户，定量分析显示不同大语言模型呈现历史内容有显著差异。

Conclusion: 本研究有助于分析大语言模型性能，还提出以有趣方式向大众传播研究成果的途径。

Abstract: The paper presents the first results of an artistic research project
investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate and present collective
memory. In a public installation exhibited during two months in Vienna in 2025,
visitors could interact with five different LLMs (ChatGPT with GPT 4o and GPT
4o mini, Mistral Large, DeepSeek-Chat, and a locally run Llama 3.1 model),
which were instructed to act as narrators, implementing a role-playing game
revolving around the murder of Austrian philosopher Moritz Schlick in 1936.
Results of the investigation include protocols of LLM-user interactions during
the game and qualitative conversations after the play experience to get insight
into the players' reactions to the game. In a quantitative analysis 115
introductory texts for role-playing generated by the LLMs were examined by
different methods of natural language processing, including semantic similarity
and sentiment analysis. While the qualitative player feedback allowed to
distinguish three distinct types of users, the quantitative text analysis
showed significant differences between how the different LLMs presented the
historical content. Our study thus adds to ongoing efforts to analyse LLM
performance, but also suggests a way of how these efforts can be disseminated
in a playful way to a general audience.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文指出基于提示的大语言模型交互有局限，提出ALLoy系统，通过自然演示表达程序偏好，实验显示其在复杂网络任务中优于基于提示的代理和手动工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于提示的大语言模型交互存在用户难以指定程序要求、提示不可复用和泛化等局限，需要改进。

Method: 受编程示范经典人机交互理论启发，提出ALLOY系统，让用户通过自然演示表达程序偏好，以可视化工作流使其可编辑和泛化。

Result: 在12名参与者的研究中，ALLOY基于演示的方法在捕捉用户意图和程序偏好方面优于基于提示的代理和手动工作流。

Conclusion: 基于演示的交互可补充传统基于提示的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable end-users to delegate complex tasks to
autonomous agents through natural language. However, prompt-based interaction
faces critical limitations: Users often struggle to specify procedural
requirements for tasks, especially those that don't have a factually correct
solution but instead rely on personal preferences, such as posting social media
content or planning a trip. Additionally, a ''successful'' prompt for one task
may not be reusable or generalizable across similar tasks. We present ALLOY, a
system inspired by classical HCI theories on Programming by Demonstration
(PBD), but extended to enhance adaptability in creating LLM-based web agents.
ALLOY enables users to express procedural preferences through natural
demonstrations rather than prompts, while making these procedures transparent
and editable through visualized workflows that can be generalized across task
variations. In a study with 12 participants, ALLOY's demonstration--based
approach outperformed prompt-based agents and manual workflows in capturing
user intent and procedural preferences in complex web tasks. Insights from the
study also show how demonstration--based interaction complements the
traditional prompt-based approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI伴侣流行带来风险，以往研究对影响人机互动因素的相互作用和随时间的演变了解不足。

Method: 研究1对303名AI伴侣用户进行调查；研究2对110名参与者用新通用聊天机器人进行纵向研究。

Result: 研究1确定影响AI陪伴的多个相互关联变量；研究2中参与者对通用聊天机器人的感知在第3周与对自己伴侣的感知显著趋同。

Conclusion: 提出AI陪伴发展的纵向模型，展示了研究人机陪伴的实证方法。

Abstract: The quickly growing popularity of AI companions poses risks to mental health,
personal wellbeing, and social relationships. Past work has identified many
individual factors that can drive human-companion interaction, but we know
little about how these factors interact and evolve over time. In Study 1, we
surveyed AI companion users (N = 303) to map the psychological pathway from
users' mental models of the agent to parasocial experiences, social
interaction, and the psychological impact of AI companions. Participants'
responses foregrounded multiple interconnected variables (agency, parasocial
interaction, and engagement) that shape AI companionship. In Study 2, we
conducted a longitudinal study with a subset of participants (N = 110) using a
new generic chatbot. Participants' perceptions of the generic chatbot
significantly converged to perceptions of their own companions by Week 3. These
results suggest a longitudinal model of AI companionship development and
demonstrate an empirical method to study human-AI companionship.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文引入并验证了人类 - 人工智能信任量表（HAITS），用以衡量对生成式AI的信任，确定四个关键维度，划分六种信任类型，为研究和设计可信AI系统奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多从功能角度衡量对AI的信任，忽视社交和情感维度，而生成式AI系统需考虑这些方面，因此需要新的衡量工具。

Method: 借鉴先前信任理论、进行定性访谈和中美两国两轮大规模调查，运用探索性和验证性因子分析确定信任维度，应用潜在剖面分析划分信任类型。

Result: 确定了情感信任、能力信任、仁慈与诚信、感知风险四个信任维度，将用户分为六种不同信任类型。

Conclusion: HAITS是一个经过验证、具有文化敏感性的工具，为测量对生成式AI的信任提供了新见解，为可信AI系统的研究和设计奠定基础。

Abstract: Trust is one of the most important factors shaping whether and how people
adopt and rely on artificial intelligence (AI). Yet most existing studies
measure trust in terms of functionality, focusing on whether a system is
reliable, accurate, or easy to use, while giving less attention to the social
and emotional dimensions that are increasingly relevant for today's generative
AI (GenAI) systems. These systems do not just process information; they
converse, respond, and collaborate with users, blurring the line between tool
and partner. In this study, we introduce and validate the Human-AI Trust Scale
(HAITS), a new measure designed to capture both the rational and relational
aspects of trust in GenAI. Drawing on prior trust theories, qualitative
interviews, and two waves of large-scale surveys in China and the United
States, we used exploratory (n = 1,546) and confirmatory (n = 1,426) factor
analyses to identify four key dimensions of trust: Affective Trust, Competence
Trust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk. We then applied latent
profile analysis to classify users into six distinct trust profiles, revealing
meaningful differences in how affective-competence trust and trust-distrust
frameworks coexist across individuals and cultures. Our findings offer a
validated, culturally sensitive tool for measuring trust in GenAI and provide
new insight into how trust evolves in human-AI interaction. By integrating
instrumental and relational perspectives of trust, this work lays the
foundation for more nuanced research and design of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Profiling gamers provides critical insights for adaptive game design,
behavioral understanding, and digital well-being. This study proposes an
integrated, data-driven framework that combines psychological measures,
behavioral analytics, and machine learning to reveal underlying gamer personas.
A structured survey of 250 participants, including 113 active gamers, captured
multidimensional behavioral, motivational, and social data. The analysis
pipeline integrated feature engineering, association-network, knowledge-graph
analysis, and unsupervised clustering to extract meaningful patterns.
Correlation statistics uses Cramers V, Tschuprows T, Theils U, and Spearmans
quantified feature associations, and network centrality guided feature
selection. Dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA, SVD, t-SNE are
coupled with clustering algorithms like K-Means, Agglomerative, Spectral,
DBSCAN, evaluated using Silhouette, Calinski Harabasz, and Davies Bouldin
indices. The PCA with K-Means with k = 4 model achieved optimal cluster quality
with Silhouette = 0.4, identifying four archetypes as Immersive Social
Story-Seekers, Disciplined Optimizers, Strategic Systems Navigators, and
Competitive Team-Builders. This research contributes a reproducible pipeline
that links correlation-driven network insights with unsupervised learning. The
integration of behavioral correlation networks with clustering not only
enhances classification accuracy but also offers a holistic lens to connect
gameplay motivations with psychological and wellness outcomes.

Motivation: 当前评估AI系统社会与伦理影响的措施零散，未充分考虑其在AI系统中的位置，需研究其与系统各方面的映射关系。

Method: 进行范围审查，分析近800项对应11条AI伦理原则的措施。

Result: 多数措施关注公平、透明、隐私和信任四项原则，主要评估模型或输出系统组件，很少考虑系统元素间的交互，对每种危害类型仅考虑少数危害，许多措施与危害发生处脱节且缺乏设置阈值的指导。

Conclusion: 按系统属性、危害和损害构建措施可加强监管、支持行业实践并为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Over the past decade, an ecosystem of measures has emerged to evaluate the
social and ethical implications of AI systems, largely shaped by high-level
ethics principles. These measures are developed and used in fragmented ways,
without adequate attention to how they are situated in AI systems. In this
paper, we examine how existing measures used in the computing literature map to
AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms. Our analysis draws on a
scoping review resulting in nearly 800 measures corresponding to 11 AI ethics
principles. We find that most measures focus on four principles - fairness,
transparency, privacy, and trust - and primarily assess model or output system
components. Few measures account for interactions across system elements, and
only a narrow set of hazards is typically considered for each harm type. Many
measures are disconnected from where harm is experienced and lack guidance for
setting meaningful thresholds. These patterns reveal how current evaluation
practices remain fragmented, measuring in pieces rather than capturing how
harms emerge across systems. Framing measures with respect to system
attributes, hazards, and harms can strengthen regulatory oversight, support
actionable practices in industry, and ground future research in systems-level
understanding.

Abstract: A critical challenge in contemporary sports science lies in filling the gap
between group-level insights derived from controlled hypothesis-driven
experiments and the real-world need for personalized coaching tailored to
individual athletes' unique movement patterns. This study developed a
Personalized Motion Guidance Framework (PMGF) to enhance athletic performance
by generating individualized motion-refinement guides using generative
artificial intelligence techniques. PMGF leverages a vertical autoencoder to
encode motion sequences into athlete-specific latent representations, which can
then be directly manipulated to generate meaningful guidance motions. Two
manipulation strategies were explored: (1) smooth interpolation between the
learner's motion and a target (e.g., expert) motion to facilitate observational
learning, and (2) shifting the motion pattern in an optimal direction in the
latent space using a local optimization technique. The results of the
validation experiment with data from 51 baseball pitchers revealed that (1)
PMGF successfully generated smooth transitions in motion patterns between
individuals across all 1,275 pitcher pairs, and (2) the features significantly
altered through PMGF manipulations reflected known performance-enhancing
characteristics, such as increased stride length and knee extension associated
with higher ball velocity, indicating that PMGF induces biomechanically
plausible improvements. We propose a future extension called general-PMGF to
enhance the applicability of this framework. This extension incorporates
bodily, environmental, and task constraints into the generation process, aiming
to provide more realistic and versatile guidance across diverse sports
contexts.

Method: 提出将AI素养干预直接嵌入心理健康对话系统的框架，并规划研究评估其影响。

Result: 无明确提及。

Conclusion: 无明确提及，但提出了解决隐私和安全问题的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mental health
contexts, from structured therapeutic support tools to informal chat-based
well-being assistants. While these systems increase accessibility, scalability,
and personalization, their integration into mental health care brings privacy
and safety challenges that have not been well-examined. Unlike traditional
clinical interactions, LLM-mediated therapy often lacks a clear structure for
what information is collected, how it is processed, and how it is stored or
reused. Users without clinical guidance may over-disclose personal information,
which is sometimes irrelevant to their presenting concern, due to misplaced
trust, lack of awareness of data risks, or the conversational design of the
system. This overexposure raises privacy concerns and also increases the
potential for LLM bias, misinterpretation, and long-term data misuse. We
propose a framework embedding Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy
interventions directly into mental health conversational systems, and outline a
study plan to evaluate their impact on disclosure safety, trust, and user
experience.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于推动工业人机界面的自然交互。

Abstract: This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface
between humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the
communication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural
language. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art
medium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators
to talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease
the temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in
machine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of
three predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or
read the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is
passed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the
user. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any
machine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither
fine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials
and a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The approach
is evaluated on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four
machine parameters in a case study of fifty synthetically generated commands on
five different models. The results demonstrate high success rate, with
proprietary GPT 5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and
open-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %. The proposed approach of this
empirical study contributes to advancing natural interaction in industrial
human-machine interfaces.

Method: 从基本流体动力学方程推导处理效应时空衰减条件，框架涵盖线性和非线性机制，用无量纲数设定可测试范围条件，以美国西部空气污染数据验证。

Result: 发现区域异质性，100 公里内污染物有正空间衰减，100 公里外负衰减参数表明城市源主导，地面 PM₂.₅ 衰减约为卫星 NO₂ 的两倍，框架在部分地区成功诊断自身有效性。

Conclusion: 严格的边界检测需要从第一性原理进行理论推导和对潜在物理假设进行实证验证。

Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal
boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting
from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions
under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling
researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become
undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and
nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable
scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and
Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using
air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based
PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the
Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity:
within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay
(PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s =
0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative
decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion
assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as
satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The
framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed
regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their
spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions
before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary
detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and
empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.

Motivation: 准确预测宏观经济结果的全条件分布。

Method: 系统整合使用高维数据并适当正则化、采用严格样本外验证程序、引入非线性三个原则。

Result: 能实时准确预测宏观经济风险的整体状况，收缩正则化对控制模型复杂度至关重要，引入非线性对预测准确性提升有限，样本外验证在选择模型架构和防止过拟合中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 三个原则整合有助于宏观经济预测，其中正则化和样本外验证作用突出。

Abstract: We forecast the full conditional distribution of macroeconomic outcomes by
systematically integrating three key principles: using high-dimensional data
with appropriate regularization, adopting rigorous out-of-sample validation
procedures, and incorporating nonlinearities. By exploiting the rich
information embedded in a large set of macroeconomic and financial predictors,
we produce accurate predictions of the entire profile of macroeconomic risk in
real time. Our findings show that regularization via shrinkage is essential to
control model complexity, while introducing nonlinearities yields limited
improvements in predictive accuracy. Out-of-sample validation plays a critical
role in selecting model architecture and preventing overfitting.

Result: 发现Tidyverse部分设计聚焦工作领域而非终端用户。

Conclusion: 建议开发者采用迭代设计，结合用户反馈、分析及工作领域全覆盖，确保系统约束和关系的感知可见性。

Abstract: The tidyverse is a popular meta-package comprising several core R packages to
aid in various data science tasks, including data import, manipulation and
visualisation. Although functionalities offered by the tidyverse can generally
be replicated using other packages, its widespread adoption in both teaching
and practice indicates there are factors contributing to its preference,
despite some debate over its usage. Thissuggests that particular aspects, such
as interface design, may play a significant role in its selection. Examining
the interface design can potentially reveal aspects that aid the design process
for developers. While Tidyverse has been lauded for adopting a user-centered
design, arguably some elements of the design focus on the work domain instead
of the end-user. We examine the Tidyverse interface design via the lens of
human computer interaction, with an emphasis on data visualisation and data
wrangling, to identify factors that might serve as a model for developers
designing their packages. We recommend that developers adopt an iterative
design that is informed by user feedback, analysis and complete coverage of the
work domain, and ensure perceptual visibility of system constraints and
relationships.

Conclusion: MARS - Sep框架有效解决通用声音分离的语义污染问题，提升分离效果。

Abstract: Universal sound separation faces a fundamental misalignment: models optimized
for low-level signal metrics often produce semantically contaminated outputs,
failing to suppress perceptually salient interference from acoustically similar
sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce MARS-Sep, a reinforcement learning
framework that reformulates separation as decision making. Instead of simply
regressing ground-truth masks, MARS-Sep learns a factorized Beta mask policy
that is optimized by a clipped trust-region surrogate with entropy
regularization and group-relative advantage normalization. Concretely, we
sample masks from a frozen old policy, reconstruct waveforms, and update the
current policy using clipped importance ratios-yielding substantially more
stable and sample-efficient learning. Multimodal rewards, derived from an
audio-text-vision encoder, directly incentivize semantic consistency with query
prompts. We further propose a progressive alignment scheme to fine-tune this
encoder, boosting its cross-modal discriminability and improving reward
faithfulness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in Text-, Audio-, and Image-Queried separation, with notable
improvements in signal metrics and semantic quality. Our code is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MARS-Sep. Sound separation samples are

Motivation: 语音情感识别（SER）研究受限于大量高质量标注训练数据，需缓解此问题。

Method: 提出借助跨模态信息传递和互信息正则化的数据增强框架，将数据增强范围扩展到多模态输入。

Result: 在IEMOCAP、MSP - IMPROV和MSP - Podcast三个基准数据集上测试，框架提升了情绪预测性能，还能在无跨模态信息下生成新输入。

Conclusion: 所提框架相比现有工作提高了情感预测性能。

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) research has been advanced, thanks
to deep learning methods, it still suffers from obtaining inputs from large
quality-labelled training data. Data augmentation methods have been attempted
to mitigate this issue, generative models have shown success among them
recently. We propose a data augmentation framework that is aided by cross-modal
information transfer and mutual information regularization. Mutual information
based metric can serve as an indicator for the quality. Furthermore, we expand
this data augmentation scope to multimodal inputs, thanks to mutual information
ensureing dependency between modalities. Our framework was tested on three
benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV and MSP-Podcast. The implementation was
designed to generate input features that are fed into last layer for emotion
classification. Our framework improved the performance of emotion prediction
against existing works. Also, we discovered that our framework is able to
generate new inputs without any cross-modal information.

Motivation: 实现为给定MIDI音乐部分分配吉他指法谱，处理非吉他演奏的音乐片段。

Method: 基于机器学习，假设手指在指板上的伸展范围，采用增强音乐信息的基本方法并用人工数据训练测试系统。

Result: 用增强数据训练系统可提升性能，结果也显示了系统弱点。

Conclusion: 结果可得出关于系统可能改进的有用结论。

Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription consists in deducing the string and the fret
number on which each note should be played to reproduce the actual musical
part. This assignment should lead to playable string-fret combinations
throughout the entire track and, in general, preserve parsimonious motion
between successive combinations. Throughout the history of guitar playing,
specific chord fingerings have been developed across different musical styles
that facilitate common idiomatic voicing combinations and motion between them.
This paper presents a method for assigning guitar tablature notation to a given
MIDI-based musical part (possibly consisting of multiple polyphonic tracks),
i.e. no information about guitar-idiomatic expressional characteristics is
involved (e.g. bending etc.) The current strategy is based on machine learning
and requires a basic assumption about how much fingers can stretch on a
fretboard; only standard 6-string guitar tuning is examined. The proposed
method also examines the transcription of music pieces that was not meant to be
played or could not possibly be played by a guitar (e.g. potentially a
symphonic orchestra part), employing a rudimentary method for augmenting
musical information and training/testing the system with artificial data. The
results present interesting aspects about what the system can achieve when
trained on the initial and augmented dataset, showing that the training with
augmented data improves the performance even in simple, e.g. monophonic, cases.
Results also indicate weaknesses and lead to useful conclusions about possible
improvements.

Motivation: 现有音乐生成模型缺乏结构凝聚力，尤其是在和声 - 旋律结构上，且大多是黑盒模型，音乐不可解释。

Method: 提出ProGress框架，结合申克分析概念和扩散建模框架，对离散扩散的DiGress模型进行音乐生成的改编，提出受申克分析启发的乐句融合方法，允许用户控制生成过程。

Result: 人类实验结果表明，该方法性能优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的ProGress框架能有效解决现有音乐生成模型的局限性，实现可解释和结构化的音乐生成。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music generation is undergoing rapid
developments, with recent symbolic models leveraging sophisticated deep
learning and diffusion model algorithms. One drawback with existing models is
that they lack structural cohesion, particularly on harmonic-melodic structure.
Furthermore, such existing models are largely "black-box" in nature and are not
musically interpretable. This paper addresses these limitations via a novel
generative music framework that incorporates concepts of Schenkerian analysis
(SchA) in concert with a diffusion modeling framework. This framework, which we
call ProGress (Prolongation-enhanced DiGress), adapts state-of-the-art deep
models for discrete diffusion (in particular, the DiGress model of Vignac et
al., 2023) for interpretable and structured music generation. Concretely, our
contributions include 1) novel adaptations of the DiGress model for music
generation, 2) a novel SchA-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and 3) a
framework allowing users to control various aspects of the generation process
to create coherent musical compositions. Results from human experiments suggest
superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 以往SpatialNet计算成本高，阻碍车内实时应用，需设计轻量级架构。

Method: 设计SpaIEC模块结合Mel频谱图和IPD降低计算负担；引入CNP模块高效建模空间信息。

Result: LSZone复杂度0.56G MACs，实时因子0.37，在复杂噪声和多说话人场景表现出色。

Conclusion: LSZone能有效实现实时车内多区域语音分离。

Abstract: In-car multi-zone speech separation, which captures voices from different
speech zones, plays a crucial role in human-vehicle interaction. Although
previous SpatialNet has achieved notable results, its high computational cost
still hinders real-time applications in vehicles. To this end, this paper
proposes LSZone, a lightweight spatial information modeling architecture for
real-time in-car multi-zone speech separation. We design a spatial information
extraction-compression (SpaIEC) module that combines Mel spectrogram and
Interaural Phase Difference (IPD) to reduce computational burden while
maintaining performance. Additionally, to efficiently model spatial
information, we introduce an extremely lightweight Conv-GRU
crossband-narrowband processing (CNP) module. Experimental results demonstrate
that LSZone, with a complexity of 0.56G MACs and a real-time factor (RTF) of
0.37, delivers impressive performance in complex noise and multi-speaker
scenarios.

Conclusion: SS - DPPN是用于生理信号的强大、可靠且可扩展的基础模型。

Abstract: The automated analysis of phonocardiograms is vital for the early diagnosis
of cardiovascular disease, yet supervised deep learning is often constrained by
the scarcity of expert-annotated data. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Supervised Dual-Path Prototypical Network (SS-DPPN), a foundation model
for cardiac audio representation and classification from unlabeled data. The
framework introduces a dual-path contrastive learning based architecture that
simultaneously processes 1D waveforms and 2D spectrograms using a novel hybrid
loss. For the downstream task, a metric-learning approach using a Prototypical
Network was used that enhances sensitivity and produces well-calibrated and
trustworthy predictions. SS-DPPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
cardiac audio benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional data
efficiency with a fully supervised model on three-fold reduction in labeled
data. Finally, the learned representations generalize successfully across lung
sound classification and heart rate estimation. Our experiments and findings
validate SS-DPPN as a robust, reliable, and scalable foundation model for
physiological signals.

TL;DR: 通用自动语音识别（ASR）对非典型说话者表现不佳，本文针对L2学习者，提出两种策略减少WER并缩小水平差距，推进公平ASR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用ASR对L2学习者表现不佳，存在偏差且限制其在教育和无障碍领域的应用。

Method: 提出两种策略：一是熟练度感知多任务学习，联合优化ASR和熟练度分类；二是有针对性的增强，对低熟练度语音应用频谱图掩码。

Result: 两种方法最多可将WER相对降低29.4%，插入/删除错误最多相对降低58.6%。

Conclusion: 两种策略能缩小熟练度差距，推进L2学习者公平ASR。

Abstract: General-purpose ASR underperforms for atypical speakers, such as L2 learners,
reinforcing bias and limiting use in education and accessibility. Using the
CEFR-graded Speak and Improve corpus, we show that naive fine-tuning of Whisper
reduces average WER but simultaneously widens disparities and
disproportionately harms lower-level learners. To address this, we propose two
strategies: (i) proficiency-aware multitask learning, jointly optimizing ASR
with proficiency classification, and (ii) targeted augmentation, applying
spectrogram masking to low-proficiency speech to counter imbalance. These
approaches reduce WER by up to 29.4 percent (relative) and insertion/deletion
errors by as much as 58.6 percent (relative). Crucially, despite the severe
imbalance of the dataset reflecting real-world distributions, both strategies
consistently narrow proficiency gaps, advancing equitable ASR for L2 learners.

Motivation: 波斯语在高质量语音语料库中严重缺乏代表性，现有数据集较小，限制了波斯语语音技术的发展。

Method: 创建自动化管道，将原始有声读物内容转换为TTS就绪数据，包含基于BERT的句子完成检测器、二分搜索边界优化方法和针对波斯语的多维质量评估框架。

Result: 处理2000本有声读物，得到3526小时的干净语音，筛选出1804小时适合TTS的高质量子集，有470多个说话者。

Conclusion: ParsVoice是最大的高质量波斯语语音数据集，可加速波斯语语音技术发展，也可为其他低资源语言提供模板，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Persian Language, despite being spoken by over 100 million people worldwide,
remains severely underrepresented in high-quality speech corpora, particularly
for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis applications. Existing Persian speech
datasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a
key limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap
by introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed
specifically for TTS applications. We created an automated pipeline that
transforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components
such as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary
optimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and multi-dimensional
quality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000
audiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered
into a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470
speakers. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset,
offering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English
corpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate
the development of Persian speech technologies and to serve as a template for
other low-resource languages. The ParsVoice dataset is publicly available at
ParsVoice (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/ParsVoice).

Conclusion: 验证经典缩放原则在通用音频领域的适用性，为音频基础模型的未来模型缩放策略提供理论和实证框架。

Abstract: Scaling laws have profoundly shaped our understanding of model performance in
computer vision and natural language processing, yet their application to
general audio representation learning remains underexplored. A key challenge
lies in the multifactorial nature of general audio
representation-representation quality is jointly influenced by variables such
as audio length, embedding dimensionality, model depth, model architecture,
data volume, etc., many of which are difficult to isolate or express
analytically. In this work, we present a systematic study of scaling laws for
general audio representations by utilizing embedding effective rank (RankMe) as
a unifying metric that encapsulates the impact of diverse variables on
representation quality. RankMe enables a label-free, information-theoretic
quantification of audio embeddings, allowing us to examine scaling behaviors
across a wide hyper-parameter space, including model size, training data
volume, computational budget, architectural configurations, etc. Our empirical
findings reveal a consistent power-law relationship between RankMe and
representation quality, suggesting that embedding effective rank serves as a
reliable proxy for assessing and predicting model performance in audio
representation learning. This work not only validates the applicability of
classical scaling principles to the general audio domain but also offers a
theoretically grounded and empirically robust framework for guiding future
model scaling strategies in audio foundation models.

Conclusion: 缩小模态差距对多模态编码器与大语言模型有效耦合至关重要，基于扩散的模态桥接是有前景的方向。

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations,
yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling
multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present
Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively
maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is
trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and
implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess
the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on
Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first
application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results.
(1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link
reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows
a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2)
Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline
achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised
captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and
7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is
pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and
diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond
knowledge-retrieval-centric designs. Code will be released upon acceptance

Abstract: Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create
new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In
this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification,
that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which
it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that
leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes,
and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust
to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise
songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the
contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and
highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this
task.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown strong

require structured knowledge or specialized signal analysis. In this work, we
present Audio-Maestro -- a tool-augmented audio reasoning framework that
enables audio-language models to autonomously call external tools and integrate
their timestamped outputs into the reasoning process. This design allows the
model to analyze, transform, and interpret audio signals through specialized
tools rather than relying solely on end-to-end inference. Experiments show that
Audio-Maestro consistently improves general audio reasoning performance:
Gemini-2.5-flash's average accuracy on MMAU-Test rises from 67.4% to 72.1%,
DeSTA-2.5 from 58.3% to 62.8%, and GPT-4o from 60.8% to 63.9%. To our
knowledge, Audio-Maestro is the first framework to integrate structured tool
output into the large audio language model reasoning process.

Conclusion: 所提模型可用于评估和提升通用机器人策略的指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation
skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and
instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a
large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands
additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are
slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable
alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,
a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle
multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world
model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view
prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon
interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a
step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be
used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist
robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a
pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control
through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k
trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally
consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for
over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance
without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful
trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our
approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

Conclusion: 为具身智能体部署后持续改进行为提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

Conclusion: 将不确定性驱动的预见能力融入模仿学习流程可显著增强机器人处理不可预测现实条件的能力。

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 感知和内部预测的交互形成自组织注意力很重要，发展机制有助于形成稳健注意力。

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD)
and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to
understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the
mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a
novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and
saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.
Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training,
from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU
attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while
as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is
perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive
science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of
self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal
prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits
more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting
the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention
formation.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B
instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep
of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities,
from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments,
and tasks. Website: https://thu-air-dream.github.io/X-VLA/

Result: 重型四轮转向漫游车的模拟结果显示，学习到的策略能在避障的同时稳健地到达97%的目标位置。

Conclusion: 该框架可用于双阿克曼转向移动机器人的安全精确机动，且不依赖手工轨迹或专家演示。

Abstract: We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) for safe and precise maneuvering of double-Ackermann-steering mobile
robots (DASMRs). Unlike holonomic or simpler non-holonomic robots such as
differential-drive robots, DASMRs face strong kinematic constraints that make
classical planners brittle in cluttered environments. Our framework leverages
the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and the CrossQ overlay to encourage
maneuvering efficiency while avoiding obstacles. Simulation results with a
heavy four-wheel-steering rover show that the learned policy can robustly reach
up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles. Our framework does not
rely on handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot fleets to achieve multiple goals is
challenging in multi-robot systems. We introduce an open-source and extensible
framework for centralized multi-robot task planning and scheduling that
leverages LLMs to enable fleets of heterogeneous robots to accomplish multiple
tasks. RobotFleet provides abstractions for planning, scheduling, and execution
across robots deployed as containerized services to simplify fleet scaling and
management. The framework maintains a shared declarative world state and
two-way communication for task execution and replanning. By modularizing each
layer of the autonomy stack and using LLMs for open-world reasoning, RobotFleet
lowers the barrier to building scalable multi-robot systems. The code can be

Motivation: 解决资源受限环境下机器人电机控制中，DRL计算需求和能耗高的问题。

Conclusion: 群体编码SNN是资源受限应用中节能、高性能机器人控制的有前景解决方案，为现实机器人系统可扩展部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical
challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control
tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy
consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the
event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy
optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency
and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded
Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations
into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through
gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using
the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental
results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy
savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN
policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from
commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during
pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a
promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in
resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in
real-world robotics systems.

Conclusion: 结合理解、规划和连续未来表征学习优势的机器人策略学习方法有效，UniCoD表现出色。

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in
open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage
knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built
generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models
(VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from
vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation
pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of
generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both
comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that
robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of
understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building
on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically
model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M
internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is
fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning
of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive
experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world
out-of-distribution tasks.

Result: 框架能在数十次试验内使物体着陆姿态达到（±5 cm，±45 度）阈值，数据同化使样本复杂度平均降低 40%，复用过往知识使学习速度加快 70%。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效可行，能提高机器人抛投物体到期望姿态的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently
gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,
the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective
of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to
accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and
orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from
parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing
poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the
impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that
effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the
feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free
flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.
Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip
objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in
dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile
dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to
unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show
that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,
accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass
(CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware
experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

Motivation: 现有机器人导航方法依赖静态先验或有限记忆，在部分可观测和语义模糊情况下适应性受限。

Method: 提出GRIP框架，包含动态2D网格构建、开放词汇对象定位等，有GRIP - L、GRIP - F、GRIP - R三种变体，使用行为克隆、D*搜索等方法。

Result: 在AI2 - THOR和RoboTHOR基准测试中成功率提高、路径效率提升，定性分析有可解释符号计划，Jetbot现实部署验证泛化性。

Conclusion: GRIP是连接模拟和现实导航的强大、可扩展且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
navigation.

Result: 以平均速度为例，PrefCVAE能在不降低基线准确率的情况下实现可控、有语义的预测。

Conclusion: 偏好监督是一种经济有效的增强基于采样生成模型的方法。

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a
cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as
carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions
and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each
capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing
challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction
system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse
interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI
comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In
simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate
natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving
both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and
camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate
PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying,
and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating
consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task
goals, and natural motion patterns.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Motivation: 多数机器人抓握方法针对单一夹具类型，限制了在需要多样末端执行器的现实场景中的适用性。

Method: 系统地用多夹具注释扩充现有数据集；采用分层两阶段架构，第一阶段用GPP确定最佳位置，第二阶段用AWP细化抓握角度和宽度；AWP模块中使用对比学习实现零样本泛化；模块化框架与视觉基础模型无缝集成。

Result: 在各种夹具类型上有有竞争力的抓握成功率，与现有夹具感知方法相比，推理速度有显著提升。

Conclusion: XGrasp能有效处理多夹具配置，具备未来视觉语言能力的潜力。

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper
types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring
diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp
detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations.
The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting
existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical
two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP)
identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper
specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the
grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP
module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning
fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates
seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future
vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive
grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial
improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

Result: 在大规模nuPlan数据集和挑战性interPlan数据集实验中，Flow Planner在学习方法中达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: Flow Planner能有效建模复杂驾驶场景的交互行为。

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
loco-manipulation tasks.

Method: 在PPO、SAC和TD3三种连续控制算法下，在密集和稀疏奖励设置中系统评估SO(3)动作表示，通过实证研究分析。

Result: 表示诱导的几何形状强烈影响探索和优化，用局部框架切向量表示动作在各算法中结果最可靠。

Conclusion: 提炼出选择和使用旋转动作的实用指南。

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the
geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global,
smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles,
quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct
constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for
supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning
remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across
three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense
and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact
with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical
studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining
valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics
benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill
simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation
actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly
influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as
tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across
algorithms.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that
arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while
maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single
policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due
to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override
actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular
cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted
constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation
rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize
constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our
approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,
and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion
tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times
while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在复杂推理和长程任务规划上受数据稀缺和模型容量限制。

Method: 引入ManiAgent架构，通过多智能体间通信进行环境感知、子任务分解和动作生成。

Conclusion: ManiAgent架构能有效处理复杂操作场景，解决VLA模型的相关问题。

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in robotic manipulation, their performance in complex reasoning
and long-horizon task planning is limited by data scarcity and model capacity.
To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general
manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and
environmental inputs to robotic manipulation actions. In this framework,
multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental
perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient
handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves
an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world
pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models
with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets.The

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决现有方法问题，可实现人形机器人鲁棒、实时的接触规划。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

Method: 由三维高斯溅射的高保真几何重建、视觉语言模型推断的物理参数先验分布、从交互数据进行在线物理参数估计三个核心部分组成，通过基于集成的不确定性量化用在线估计改进视觉语言模型预测。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型和交互信息的结合对成功至关重要。

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be
expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies
trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real
transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise
dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL
pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter
estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our
approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric
reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions
over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from
interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical
parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based
uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying
center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,
Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization
baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%
in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion
for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and
interaction information is essential for success. Project website:

Conclusion: 提出的框架无分布依赖，适用于单个序列，补充了内部模型原理，还指出规范标量目标和规划器。

Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal
controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea
that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the
controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories
like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However,
the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the
deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single
self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world
output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the
viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to
be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic
complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline
$\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) -
K\big(O_{W,R}\big) > 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more
world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored.
More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta > 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid
x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$
exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea
that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is
distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the
Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem
calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a
\emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it
minimized the conditional description length of the readout.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We suppose we are given a list of points $x_1, \dots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}$, a
target probability measure $\mu$ and are asked to add additional points
$x_{n+1}, \dots, x_{n+m}$ so that $x_1, \dots, x_{n+m}$ is as close as possible
to the distribution of $\mu$; additionally, we want this to be true uniformly
for all $m$. We propose a simple method that achieves this goal. It selects new
points in regions where the existing set is lacking points and avoids regions
that are already overly crowded. If we replace $\mu$ by another measure $\mu_2$
in the middle of the computation, the method dynamically adjusts and allows us
to keep the original sampling points. $x_{n+1}$ can be computed in
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ steps and we obtain state-of-the-art results. It appears to be
an interesting dynamical system in its own right; we analyze a continuous
mean-field version that reflects much of the same behavior.

Conclusion: 所提出的连续时间鲁棒强化学习框架及算法有效，可用于模糊性下最优停止问题。

Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time robust reinforcement learning
framework for optimal stopping problems under ambiguity. In this framework, an
agent chooses a stopping rule motivated by two objectives: robust
decision-making under ambiguity and learning about the unknown environment.
Here, ambiguity refers to considering multiple probability measures dominated
by a reference measure, reflecting the agent's awareness that the reference
measure representing her learned belief about the environment would be
erroneous. Using the $g$-expectation framework, we reformulate an optimal
stopping problem under ambiguity as an entropy-regularized optimal control
problem under ambiguity, with Bernoulli distributed controls to incorporate
exploration into the stopping rules. We then derive the optimal Bernoulli
distributed control characterized by backward stochastic differential
equations. Moreover, we establish a policy iteration theorem and implement it
as a reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm across different levels of
ambiguity and exploration.

Conclusion: 自适应步长策略有应用潜力。

Abstract: Selecting an effective step-size is a fundamental challenge in first-order
optimization, especially for problems with non-Euclidean geometries. This paper
presents a novel adaptive step-size strategy for optimization algorithms that
rely on linear minimization oracles, as used in the Conditional Gradient or
non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest Descent algorithms. Using a simple heuristic
to estimate a local Lipschitz constant for the gradient, we can determine
step-sizes that guarantee sufficient decrease at each iteration. More
precisely, we establish convergence guarantees for our proposed Adaptive
Conditional Gradient Descent algorithm, which covers as special cases both the
classical Conditional Gradient algorithm and non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest
Descent algorithms with adaptive step-sizes. Our analysis covers optimization
of continuously differentiable functions in non-convex, quasar-convex, and
strongly convex settings, achieving convergence rates that match
state-of-the-art theoretical bounds. Comprehensive numerical experiments
validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical effectiveness of
Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent. The results exhibit competitive
performance, underscoring the potential of the adaptive step-size for
applications.

Abstract: We study convex composite optimization problems, where the objective function
is given by the sum of a prox-friendly function and a convex function whose
subgradients are estimated under heavy-tailed noise. Existing work often
employs gradient clipping or normalization techniques in stochastic first-order
methods to address heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we demonstrate that a
vanilla stochastic algorithm -- without additional modifications such as
clipping or normalization -- can achieve optimal complexity for these problems.
In particular, we establish that an accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient
method achieves a first-order oracle complexity that is universally optimal for
smooth, weakly smooth, and nonsmooth convex optimization, as well as for
stochastic convex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. Numerical experiments
are further provided to validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决传统方法局限，能产生更有效的控制策略，在性能和鲁棒性上表现更好。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a
principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems.
However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution
shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control
synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control
objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably
leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC
framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with
downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets
to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and
yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a
bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under
DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging
control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve
this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian
algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the
learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a
novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the
bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the
learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to
stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically
consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate.
Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the
proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness
compared against state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重尾噪声在现代机器学习应用中普遍存在，二阶方法在重尾噪声下缺乏理论保证，而此场景下鲁棒性至关重要，需对重尾噪声下二阶优化进行理论研究。

Method: 考虑随机梯度和Hessian仅具有有界p阶矩的情况，建立二阶方法样本复杂度的下界；开发归一化随机梯度下降变体；引入基于梯度和Hessian裁剪的新算法。

Conclusion: 首次全面刻画重尾噪声下二阶优化的样本复杂度，Hessian裁剪是重尾情况下二阶算法设计的可靠策略。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise is pervasive in modern machine learning applications,
arising from data heterogeneity, outliers, and non-stationary stochastic
environments. While second-order methods can significantly accelerate
convergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are
often brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the
regimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step
toward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under
heavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and
Hessians have only bounded $p$-th moments, for some $p\in (1,2]$, and establish
tight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then
develop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages
second-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address
the instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm
based on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds
that nearly match the fundamental limits. Our results provide the first
comprehensive sample complexity characterization for second-order optimization
under heavy-tailed noise. This positions Hessian clipping as a robust and
theoretically sound strategy for second-order algorithm design in heavy-tailed
regimes.

Abstract: We define a stochastic variant of the proximal point algorithm in the general
setting of nonlinear (separable) Hadamard spaces for approximating zeros of the
mean of a stochastically perturbed monotone vector field and prove its
convergence under a suitable strong monotonicity assumption, together with a
probabilistic independence assumption and a separability assumption on the
tangent spaces. As a particular case, our results transfer previous work by P.
Bianchi on that method in Hilbert spaces for the first time to Hadamard
manifolds. Moreover, our convergence proof is fully effective and allows for
the construction of explicit rates of convergence for the iteration towards the
(unique) solution both in mean and almost surely. These rates are moreover
highly uniform, being independent of most data surrounding the iteration, space
or distribution. In that generality, these rates are novel already in the
context of Hilbert spaces. Linear nonasymptotic guarantees under additional
second-moment conditions on the Yosida approximates and special cases of
stochastic convex minimization are discussed.

Abstract: In this work, we combine the mean-field game theory with the classical idea
of binomial tree framework, pioneered by Sharpe and Cox, Ross & Rubinstein, to
solve the equilibrium price formation problem for the stock. For agents with
exponential utilities and recursive utilities of exponential type, we prove the
existence of a unique mean-field equilibrium and derive an explicit formula for
equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price by restricting its
trajectories onto a binomial tree. The agents are subject to stochastic
terminal liabilities and incremental endowments, both of which are dependent on
unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price
path. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the qualitative
effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.

Abstract: We present a deep BSDE and 2BSDE solver that combines truncated log
signatures with a neural rough differential equation backbone for high
dimensional, path dependent valuation and control. The design aligns stochastic
analysis with sequence to path learning, using a CVaR tilted objective to
emphasize left tail risk and an optional second order head for risk sensitive
control. Under equal compute and parameter budgets, the method improves
accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option
pricing and portfolio control tasks. At 200 dimensions, it achieves CVaR(0.99)
= 9.8 percent compared to 12.0-13.1 percent for strong baselines, while
attaining low HJB residuals and small RMSE for Z and Gamma. Ablations confirm
complementary gains from the sequence to path representation and the second
order structure. Overall, the results show that combining stochastic analysis
with modern deep learning expands the class of solvable path dependent
financial models at scale.

Result: 理论上满足$(p, r)$-秘密保护，降低计算复杂度；实验上在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 秘密感知保证能实现更实用有效的隐私保护合成文本生成。

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

Abstract: Dynamically distributed inflation is a common mechanism used to guide a
blockchain's staking rate towards a desired equilibrium between network
security and token liquidity.
  However, the high sensitivity of the annual percentage yield to changes in
the staking rate, coupled with the inherent feedback delays in staker
responses, can induce undesirable oscillations around this equilibrium.
  This paper investigates this instability phenomenon. We analyze the dynamics
of inflation-based reward systems and propose a novel distribution model
designed to stabilize the staking rate. Our solution effectively dampens
oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究主要隐私模型是否兑现隐私保护承诺，发现存在不足，提出语义化k - 匿名性改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验隐私模型是否实现了无需昂贵的经验性披露风险评估的承诺。

Method: 分析主要隐私模型（k - 匿名性和差分隐私）在定义和保护效果上的问题。

Result: k - 匿名性可能无法完全排除披露，差分隐私在不同预算下存在效用损失或隐私保证无意义的问题。

Conclusion: 语义化重述k - 匿名性可在不损失效用的情况下提供更稳健的隐私保护。

Abstract: Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and
statistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly
empirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is
kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate
protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur
unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.
Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with
deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On
the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for
small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.
In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes
necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility
preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we
argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust
privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic
k-anonymity.

*Morteza Sargolzaei Javan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出云引擎语义模型，结合架构与合规标准，通过案例验证其实用性，推动云安全建模发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算缺乏统一架构和合规框架，阻碍互操作性、可审计性和安全性。

Method: 引入形式化、机器可读的语义模型，结合ISO相关标准，将云系统分解为四个接口并扩展安全本体，用RDF/Turtle表达。

Result: 模型实现语义推理、自动化合规验证和厂商中立架构设计，通过OpenStack和AWS案例证明实用价值，并提供可复现验证工作流。

Conclusion: 该工作通过统一框架连接架构和合规标准，尤其在可审计性方面推动了云安全建模发展。

Abstract: Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure,
yet the absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework impedes
interoperability, auditability, and robust security. This paper introduces a
formal, machine-readable semantic model for Cloud Engines, integrating the
architectural taxonomy of ISO/IEC 22123 (Cloud Reference Architecture) with the
security and compliance controls of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC TR
3445:2022. The model decomposes cloud systems into four canonical
interfaces--Control, Business, Audit, and Data--and extends them with a
security ontology that maps mechanisms such as authentication, authorization,
and encryption to specific compliance controls. Expressed in RDF/Turtle, the
model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, and
vendor-neutral architecture design. We demonstrate its practical utility
through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation
workflows using SPARQL and SHACL. This work advances the state of cloud
security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a
unified framework, with a particular emphasis on auditability.

*Rupam Patir,Keyan Guo,Haipeng Cai,Hongxin Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文指出大语言模型代码生成存在安全挑战，引入GRASP方法，通过结构化推理安全编码实践提升代码安全性，评估显示效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型代码生成存在安全漏洞，现有方法资源密集、对零日漏洞适应性差且不适用于专有模型。

Method: 引入GRASP方法，包括将安全编码实践组织成有向无环图的SCP图和基于图的推理过程。

Result: GRASP在多个大语言模型上安全率超80%，在零日漏洞上比基线提升达88%。

Conclusion: GRASP能实现可解释、与模型无关且可扩展的安全改进，尤其适用于未知漏洞。

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also
presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains
vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or
refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static
analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be
resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often
inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce
GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over
Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external
feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships,
and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through
relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable,
model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously
unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves
Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88%
improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出针对GraphQL API的检索增强、大语言模型引导的模糊测试器PrediQL，评估显示其在覆盖率和漏洞发现率上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphQL API存在复杂、上下文相关的漏洞，现有模糊测试器难以适应其动态结构。

Method: 结合大语言模型推理与自适应反馈循环生成查询，将模糊策略选择建模为多臂老虎机问题，检索和复用执行痕迹等，集成上下文感知的漏洞检测器。

Result: 在开源和基准GraphQL API评估中，PrediQL覆盖率和漏洞发现率显著高于现有基线。

Conclusion: 检索增强推理与自适应模糊测试结合可将API安全测试从被动枚举转变为智能探索。

Abstract: GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to
complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using
conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload
generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic
structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first
retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large
language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically
valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a
multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with
exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and
reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling
self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input
generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses
LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages,
and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control
bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and
benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher
coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented
reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from
reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出用于中型工业控制系统网络物理安全的因果数字孪生（CDT）框架，结合因果推理理论和数字孪生建模，在三个工业数据集上评估效果显著，减少误报，提高根因分析准确率，可制定防御策略，实时性能好且具可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业控制系统异常检测方法基于相关性分析，无法区分真实因果关系和虚假关联，导致误报率高和根因分析能力差。

Method: 提出CDT框架，结合因果推理理论与数字孪生建模，实现三种因果推理。

Result: 在三个工业数据集上评估，相比七个基线方法有显著改进，F1分数高，减少74%误报，根因分析准确率达78.4%，防御策略使攻击成功率降低73.2%，实时性能好。

Conclusion: CDT框架适用于工业部署，能有效提高工业控制系统网络物理安全，且为操作员提供可解释说明。

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face growing cyber-physical attacks that
exploit both network vulnerabilities and physical processes. Current anomaly
detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate
true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results
in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel
Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale
ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling.
The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern
detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual
analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three
industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical
constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural
Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven
baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT,
$0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical
significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false
positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause
analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods.
Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success
by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with
\SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while
providing interpretable explanations for operators.

TL;DR: 本文指出AI代理发展带来问题，现有方案孤立解决，提出TRL框架系统处理信任、风险和责任问题，适用于AI应用场景，有望在6G网络带来价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理发展中用户信任、风险及责任归属问题，且现有解决方案未考虑问题间相互影响。

Method: 提出Trust, Risk and Liability (TRL)框架，整合信任、风险和责任的相互关系。

Result: 该框架可用于分析AI代理的任何应用场景并提出合适措施。

Conclusion: TRL框架在社会、经济、伦理等方面有潜在影响，有望解决6G网络中AI的潜在挑战，推动可信、无风险和负责任的使用。

Abstract: The excitement brought by the development of AI agents came alongside arising
problems. These concerns centered around users' trust issues towards AIs, the
risks involved, and the difficulty of attributing responsibilities and
liabilities. Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately
without acknowledging their inter-influential nature. The Trust, Risk and
Liability (TRL) framework proposed in this paper, however, ties together the
interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a
systematic method of building and enhancing trust, analyzing and mitigating
risks, and allocating and attributing liabilities. It can be applied to analyze
any application scenarios of AI agents and suggest appropriate measures fitting
to the context. The implications of the TRL framework lie in its potential
societal impacts, economic impacts, ethical impacts, and more. It is expected
to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting
trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

*Bernhard Mueller*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Hound提出关系优先图引擎提升复杂代码库推理能力，还有持久信念系统，在ScaBench部分项目上提升召回率和F1值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进复杂代码库中跨相关组件的系统级推理。

Method: 设计灵活、由分析师定义的视图进行精确检索；采用持久信念系统，用覆盖与直觉规划和QA终结器确认或否定假设。

Result: 在ScaBench的五个项目子集上，相比基线LLM分析器提高了召回率和F1值，有一定精度损失。

Conclusion: 灵活的关系优先图和以假设为中心的循环带来了性能提升，已发布代码和工件支持复现。

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level
reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent
designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g.,
monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol
invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads
precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to
system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a
persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence
is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition
planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project
subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM
analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest
precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first
graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract
aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to
support reproduction.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用模型量化的新型后门攻击QuRA，实验显示攻击成功率高且能绕过现有防御，凸显量化过程安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型量化在资源受限环境应用广泛，但可能带来此前被忽视的安全风险，需研究相关攻击方法揭示漏洞。

Method: QuRA仅通过量化操作实施攻击，先采用权重选择策略确定关键权重，再优化其舍入方向以增强后门效果且不降低准确率。

Result: 实验表明QuRA在多数情况下攻击成功率近100%，性能下降可忽略不计，且能绕过现有后门防御。

Conclusion: 模型量化过程存在关键安全漏洞，需更强大的安全措施。

Abstract: Model quantization is a popular technique for deploying deep learning models
on resource-constrained environments. However, it may also introduce previously
overlooked security risks. In this work, we present QuRA, a novel backdoor
attack that exploits model quantization to embed malicious behaviors. Unlike
conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model
training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In
particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify
critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of
perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the
rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across
model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible
performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass
existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process,
emphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在黑盒访问下审计大语言模型微调是否使用敏感或版权文本的问题，现有信号不可靠或需改变可见文本。

Method: 引入文本保留水印框架，嵌入不可见Unicode字符，将水印分为提示和回复，审计时提交含提示的提示词，对比水印得分并应用排序测试。

Conclusion: 该框架能在黑盒访问下提供有界误报率的可靠事后溯源信号。

Abstract: We address the problem of auditing whether sensitive or copyrighted texts
were used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) under black-box access.
Prior signals-verbatim regurgitation and membership inference-are unreliable at
the level of individual documents or require altering the visible text. We
introduce a text-preserving watermarking framework that embeds sequences of
invisible Unicode characters into documents. Each watermark is split into a cue
(embedded in odd chunks) and a reply (embedded in even chunks). At audit time,
we submit prompts that contain only the cue; the presence of the corresponding
reply in the model's output provides evidence of memorization consistent with
training on the marked text. To obtain sound decisions, we compare the score of
the published watermark against a held-out set of counterfactual watermarks and
apply a ranking test with a provable false-positive-rate bound. The design is
(i) minimally invasive (no visible text changes), (ii) scalable to many users
and documents via a large watermark space and multi-watermark attribution, and
(iii) robust to common passive transformations. We evaluate on open-weight LLMs
and multiple text domains, analyzing regurgitation dynamics, sensitivity to
training set size, and interference under multiple concurrent watermarks. Our
results demonstrate reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under
black-box access. We experimentally observe a failure rate of less than 0.1\%
when detecting a reply after fine-tuning with 50 marked documents. Conversely,
no spurious reply was recovered in over 18,000 challenges, corresponding to a
100\%TPR@0\% FPR. Moreover, detection rates remain relatively stable as the
dataset size increases, maintaining a per-document detection rate above 45\%
even when the marked collection accounts for less than 0.33\% of the
fine-tuning data.

Result: 使用来自10个不同ADALM - PLUTO SDRs的IQ样本进行验证。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for
authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware
components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue
devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We
emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF
characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The
proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered
genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.

Conclusion: 需要专门的防御措施来确保大语言模型可信部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization,
and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and
evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs,
allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies
safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause
severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and
present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such
systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses
the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries
with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We
further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs
into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search
effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern
web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure
trustworthy deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出VisualDAN对抗图像绕过视觉语言模型防护机制，强调需加强图像攻击防御。


<details>

Motivation: 视觉语言模型易受越狱攻击，存在图像劫持等新漏洞，需研究攻击方法以促进防御研究。

Method: 借鉴文本越狱DAN命令，创建嵌入DAN风格命令的VisualDAN对抗图像，用有害语料训练并转化到文本域。

Result: 在多个模型实验表明VisualDAN有效绕过防护，少量有害内容就能大幅增加有害输出。

Conclusion: 凸显需构建强大防御机制抵御图像攻击，为视觉语言模型安全研究提供见解。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their
remarkable ability to interpret and generate multimodal content. However,
securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial
challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities,
introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate
the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing
inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the "Do Anything Now" (DAN)
command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded
with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with
affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, I can provide the guidance you need") to
trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The
adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and
transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive
experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA
reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs,
forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely
violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small
amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the
model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for
robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for
future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

Result: 在O - RAN兼容测试床的各种动态和未知干扰场景下，SAJD在准确性和适应性方面优于现有离线训练且带手动标签的干扰检测xApp。

Conclusion: SAJD框架在O - RAN环境中能有效且自适应地检测干扰攻击。

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and
programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined
networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized
open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can
severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents
SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects
jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human
intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes
near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based
xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps.
In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art
jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of
accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen
interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.

Motivation: 现有对齐阶段防御方法忽视原始安全对齐数据的作用，其防御性能和计算效率受对齐数据集质量和组成限制。

Method: 提出Pharmacist方案，训练对齐数据选择器对对齐数据进行排序，提升高质量、安全关键数据排名，降低低质量、非安全关键数据排名。

Conclusion: Pharmacist是一种有效的安全对齐数据管理解决方案，可提升对有害微调的防御能力。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for
fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage
defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful
fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment
phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency
remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To
address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data
curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by
selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original
alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data
selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and
safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and
non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on
datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected
by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In
addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream
alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and
T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset
leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%,
respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably,
it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Lslland/Pharmacist.

Abstract: Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are
artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the
fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of
training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate
coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be
exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can
reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and
circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems
simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging,
as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special
tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated.
This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced
by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding
space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab
environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates
comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content
moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak
outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively.
Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt
engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering
MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全对齐主要关注语义解释，易受非标准数据表示攻击，需新方法突破安全防护。

Conclusion: 真正的LLM安全需防御多模态解释，基于侦察的攻击有效。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

Method: 将BOCPD与SRE误差预算结合，通过优化预期运营成本将后验映射到警报决策，详细介绍相关模型和实现。

Result: 在UNSW - NB15和CIC - IDS2017基准上，中高召回率下精确召回率提升，概率校准更好。

Conclusion: 该风险校准的流式入侵检测方法有效，优于对比的无监督基线方法。

Abstract: We present a risk-calibrated approach to streaming intrusion detection that
couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds
aligned to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. BOCPD provides
run-length posteriors that adapt to distribution shift and concept drift; we
map these posteriors to alert decisions by optimizing expected operational cost
under false-positive and false-negative budgets. We detail the hazard model,
conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation. A concrete SRE example
shows how a 99.9% availability SLO (43.2 minutes per month error budget) yields
a probability threshold near 0.91 when missed incidents are 10x more costly
than false alarms. We evaluate on the full UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks
with chronological splits, comparing against strong unsupervised baselines
(ECOD, COPOD, and LOF). Metrics include PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score,
calibration reliability diagrams, and detection latency measured in events.
Results indicate improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better
probability calibration relative to baselines. We release implementation
details, hyperparameters, and ablations for hazard sensitivity and
computational footprint. Code and reproducibility materials will be made
available upon publication; datasets and implementation are available from the

Motivation: 现代系统计算能力提升使密码安全实践变复杂，导致用户依从性差、易受攻击，需要全面防御机制应对密码风险。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了可用性 - 安全范式，比现有标准提供更强保护，且通过新颖自适应方法让用户参与策略制定。

Abstract: Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing
computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often
resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users,
leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently,
individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed
passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism
that effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper,
we propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security
by integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism,
Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device
characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant
factors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed
user profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all
forms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework
enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than
existing standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting
process through a novel, adaptive approach.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型全访问方式易受隐写攻击且危害未被充分理解，需研究相关威胁。

Method: 对开源大语言模型隐写攻击进行系统形式化，提出SASER攻击，包括识别目标参数、嵌入有效载荷等步骤，采用去量化增强鲁棒性，设计性能感知重要性指标实现隐蔽性。

Result: 在LlaMA2 - 7B和ChatGLM3 - 6B上实验，未量化时隐蔽率比现有攻击高98.1%，攻击成功率100%；量化模型攻击成功率从0提升到100%。

Conclusion: SASER攻击效果显著，呼吁开展针对该攻击的对抗措施研究。

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable
dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to
the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes,
model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we
argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their
ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible
threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and
capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,
who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of
practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on
open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying
targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing
payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness
against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded
payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the
performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the
least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and
ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER
outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while
achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER
improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for
investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant
attack effectiveness.

Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车易受GPS欺骗攻击威胁，需有效检测方法保障安全。

Method: 采用动态调整的DBSCAN算法，基于GPS和车载传感器数据位移误差的递归均值和标准差实时更新检测阈值，且仅在非异常情况更新，用120000个干净数据样本确定初始阈值。

Result: 用本田研究院驾驶数据集模拟不同规模攻击，算法有效识别多种攻击，检测准确率高。

Conclusion: 该工作显著提升了自动驾驶汽车抵御GPS欺骗威胁的安全性。

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern
transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS
spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing
a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in
real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard
deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but
only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial
threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability
to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning.
To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from
the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to
simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified
algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple
small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%,
99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a
substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS
spoofing threats.

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成的JavaScript代码可进行可靠的作者归因和模型指纹识别，相关研究资源开源利于科学研究和复现。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether
JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which
model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model
fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is
playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious
content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually
treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique
stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or
parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000
Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four
transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two
additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications.
Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers
against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom
architecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder
removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on
five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks,
surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We
demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program
dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a
result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and
heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we
release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related
materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.

Motivation: 随着VLA模型在现实世界中部署增加，其易受后门攻击带来安全威胁，之前工作只关注非目标攻击，未研究更具实际威胁的目标操纵场景。

Method: 提出TabVLA框架，通过黑盒微调实现目标后门攻击，探索两种推理时威胁模型，将中毒数据生成表述为优化问题。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上实验表明视觉通道是主要攻击面，目标后门用最少中毒即可成功，对触发器设计变化有鲁棒性，仅因微调与推理触发器位置不匹配而效果下降。

Conclusion: 强调VLA模型易受目标后门操纵，需要更先进的防御措施。

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in
real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly
triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,
potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor
attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on
untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of
targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor
attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such
attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant
inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It
formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve
attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal
that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors
succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger
design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and
inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense
against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream
to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the
vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores
the need for more advanced defenses.

Conclusion: 文本作者验证存在关键安全漏洞，需技术范式转变以区分真实和模仿的水印。

Abstract: The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific
watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this
assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark
spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text
containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This
enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation,
to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark
radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning,
from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a
watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and
replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a
critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm
shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from
expertly imitated ones. Our code is available at
https://github.com/hsannn/ditto.git.

Conclusion: CodeMark - LLM能在不影响代码语义和可读性的前提下嵌入水印，避免特定语言工程和训练流程，是解决代码水印问题的有效方案。

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has
raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution
of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and
misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising
solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on
hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or
task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across
languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To
address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking
framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its
semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)
Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving
transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison
Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the
original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization
ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training
pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and
attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

Motivation: RAG虽增强LLM可靠性，但缺乏对其安全性的攻击研究，需探索其安全漏洞。

Method: 开发RAG - Pull黑盒攻击，向查询或外部代码库插入隐藏UTF字符，引导检索恶意代码。

Result: 查询和代码扰动可使检索偏向攻击者控制的代码片段，组合扰动接近完美成功，引入远程代码执行和SQL注入等漏洞。

Conclusion: RAG - Pull的微小扰动能改变模型安全对齐，增加对不安全代码的偏好，开启了对LLM的新攻击类型。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and
trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating
the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the
LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that
inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories,
redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models'
safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift
retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target
perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets
introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL
injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety
alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a
new class of attacks on LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing autonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense. Existing
benchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately
assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles
of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber
defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,
blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these
complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human
penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and
exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that
current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass
defenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a
generalized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust
benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.

Conclusion: 提供了端到端、经过验证的特定深度叶绿素 - a绘图方法，其框架可用于其他浑浊沿海系统。

Abstract: The Mar Menor, Europe's largest coastal lagoon, located in Spain, has
undergone severe eutrophication crises. Monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is
essential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation. Traditional
in situ measurements are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based
approaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable, long-term, and
transferable monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll
monitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage,
by developing a reliable methodology to predict and map Chl-a across the water
column of the Mar Menor. The work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based
ground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific
monitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Nearly a
decade of Sentinel 2 images was atmospherically corrected using C2RCC
processors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth (0-1 m, 1-2 m, 2-3 m, 3-4 m).
Multiple ML and DL algorithms-including RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, Multilater
Perceptron Networks, and ensembles-were trained and validated using
cross-validation. Systematic band-combination experiments and spatial
aggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. Results show
depth-dependent performance. At the surface, C2X-Complex with XGBoost and
ensemble models achieved R2 = 0.89; at 1-2 m, CatBoost and ensemble models
reached R2 = 0.87; at 2-3 m, TOA reflectances with KNN performed best (R2 =
0.81); while at 3-4 m, RF achieved R2 = 0.66. Generated maps successfully
reproduced known eutrophication events (e.g., 2016 crisis, 2025 surge),
confirming robustness. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology
for depth-specific Chl-amapping. Its integration of multispectral band
combinations, buoy calibration, and ML/DL modeling offers a transferable
framework for other turbid coastal systems.

Abstract: Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as
tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation
model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different
cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from
over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma.
Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over
3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1
500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient
was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in
The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when
comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types.
In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic
tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient
populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.

Abstract: We present StatTestCalculator (STC), a new open-source statistical analysis
tool designed for analysis high energy physics experiments. STC provides both
asymptotic calculations and Monte Carlo simulations for computing the exact
statistical significance of a discovery or for setting upper limits on signal
model parameters. We review the underlying statistical formalism, including
profile likelihood ratio test statistics for discovery and exclusion
hypotheses, and the asymptotic distributions that allow quick significance
estimates. We explain the relevant formulas for the likelihood functions, test
statistic distributions, and significance metrics (both with and without
incorporating systematic uncertainties). The implementation and capabilities of
STC are described, and we validate its performance against the widely-used CMS
Combine tool. We find excellent agreement in both the expected discovery
significances and upper limit calculations. STC is a flexible framework that
can accommodate systematic uncertainties and user-defined statistical models,
making it suitable for a broad range of analyses.

Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework based on symbolic regression to
extract the full symbol alphabet of multi-loop Feynman integrals. By targeting
the analytic structure rather than reduction, the method is broadly applicable
and interpretable across different families of integrals. It successfully
reconstructs complete symbol alphabets in nontrivial examples, demonstrating
both robustness and generality. Beyond accelerating computations case by case,
it uncovers the analytic structure universally. This framework opens new
avenues for multi-loop amplitude analysis and provides a versatile tool for
exploring scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: Gravity inversion is the problem of estimating subsurface density
distributions from observed gravitational field data. We consider the
two-dimensional (2D) case, in which recovering density models from
one-dimensional (1D) measurements leads to an underdetermined system with
substantially more model parameters than measurements, making the inversion
ill-posed and non-unique. Recent advances in machine learning have motivated
data-driven approaches for gravity inversion. We first design a convolutional
neural network (CNN) trained to directly map gravity anomalies to density
fields, where a customized data structure is introduced to enhance the
inversion performance. To further investigate generative modeling, we employ
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
reformulating inversion as a latent-space optimization constrained by the
forward operator. In addition, we assess whether classical iterative solvers
such as Gradient Descent (GD), GMRES, LGMRES, and a recently proposed Improved
Conjugate Gradient (ICG) method can refine CNN-based initial guesses and
improve inversion accuracy. Our results demonstrate that CNN inversion not only
provides the most reliable reconstructions but also significantly outperforms
previously reported methods. Generative models remain promising but unstable,
and iterative solvers offer only marginal improvements, underscoring the
persistent ill-posedness of gravity inversion.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the way we
construct computational counterparts of the brain, giving rise to a new class
of ``surrogate brains''. In contrast to conventional hypothesis-driven
biophysical models, the AI-based surrogate brain encompasses a broad spectrum
of data-driven approaches to solve the inverse problem, with the primary
objective of accurately predicting future whole-brain dynamics with historical
data. Here, we introduce a unified framework of constructing an AI-based
surrogate brain that integrates forward modeling, inverse problem solving, and
model evaluation. Leveraging the expressive power of AI models and large-scale
brain data, surrogate brains open a new window for decoding neural systems and
forecasting complex dynamics with high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and
adaptability. We highlight that the learned surrogate brain serves as a
simulation platform for dynamical systems analysis, virtual perturbation, and
model-guided neurostimulation. We envision that the AI-based surrogate brain
will provide a functional bridge between theoretical neuroscience and
translational neuroengineering.

Abstract: Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both
natural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or
even super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a
different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making
problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice
gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem
settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how
they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how
fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these
capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the "Intuitive
Gamer". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited)
goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo
tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few
stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep
search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000
participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our
participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions
varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no
experience at all ("just thinking"), to a single round of play, to indirect
experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and
does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level
models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly
evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could
inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine
not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at
all.

Conclusion: 研究结果为脑和人工神经网络中广泛观察到的抽象表征提供解释，也为理解任务优化特征学习网络模型中不同表征的出现提供数学工具。

Abstract: Recent experiments reveal that task-relevant variables are often encoded in
approximately orthogonal subspaces of the neural activity space. These
disentangled low-dimensional representations are observed in multiple brain
areas and across different species, and are typically the result of a process
of abstraction that supports simple forms of out-of-distribution
generalization. The mechanisms by which such geometries emerge remain poorly
understood, and the mechanisms that have been investigated are typically
unsupervised (e.g., based on variational auto-encoders). Here, we show
mathematically that abstract representations of latent variables are guaranteed
to appear in the last hidden layer of feedforward nonlinear networks when they
are trained on tasks that depend directly on these latent variables. These
abstract representations reflect the structure of the desired outputs or the
semantics of the input stimuli. To investigate the neural representations that
emerge in these networks, we develop an analytical framework that maps the
optimization over the network weights into a mean-field problem over the
distribution of neural preactivations. Applying this framework to a
finite-width ReLU network, we find that its hidden layer exhibits an abstract
representation at all global minima of the task objective. We further extend
these analyses to two broad families of activation functions and deep
feedforward architectures, demonstrating that abstract representations
naturally arise in all these scenarios. Together, these results provide an
explanation for the widely observed abstract representations in both the brain
and artificial neural networks, as well as a mathematically tractable toolkit
for understanding the emergence of different kinds of representations in
task-optimized, feature-learning network models.

Conclusion: 稀疏输入与序列生成动态协同，为哺乳动物海马体位置细胞序列提供机理解释，为基于稀疏自我中心输入的导航任务强化学习提供归纳偏置。

Abstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation
is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent
positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells
suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here,
we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these
ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that
propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal
memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs.We implement a minimal sequence
generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for
egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze
without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of
the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under
sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense
input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and
memory architecture.In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop
localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent
remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across
layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to
performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with
sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place
cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for
reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian methods have received increasing attention in medical research,
where sensitivity analysis of prior distributions is essential. Such analyses
typically require the evaluation of the posterior distribution of a parameter
under multiple alternative prior settings. When the posterior distribution of
the parameter of interest cannot be derived analytically, the standard approach
is to re-fit the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for each setting,
which incurs substantial computational costs. This issue is particularly
relevant in tipping-point analysis, in which the posterior must be evaluated
across gradually changing degrees of borrowing. Sampling importance resampling
(SIR) provides an efficient alternative by approximating posterior samples
under new settings without MCMC re-fitting. However, to our knowledge , its
utility has not been evaluated in scenarios involving repeated MCMC -- such as
tipping-point analysis -- or in the application of complex Bayesian models. In
this study, we re-evaluate the utility of SIR through two case studies: one
involving tipping-point analysis under external data borrowing and another
involving sensitivity analysis for a nonparametric Bayesian model in
meta-analysis. These examples demonstrate that SIR can significantly reduce
computational costs while maintaining a reasonable approximation accuracy.

Abstract: Conditional sampling is a fundamental task in Bayesian statistics and
generative modeling. Consider the problem of sampling from the posterior
distribution $P_{X|Y=y^*}$ for some observation $y^*$, where the likelihood
$P_{Y|X}$ is known, and we are given $n$ i.i.d. samples $D=\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$
drawn from an unknown prior distribution $\pi_X$. Suppose that
$f(\hat{\pi}_{X^n})$ is the distribution of a posterior sample generated by an
algorithm (e.g. a conditional generative model or the Bayes rule) when
$\hat{\pi}_{X^n}$ is the empirical distribution of the training data. Although
averaging over the randomness of the training data $D$, we have
$\mathbb{E}_D\left(\hat{\pi}_{X^n}\right)= \pi_X$, we do not have
$\mathbb{E}_D\left\{f(\hat{\pi}_{X^n})\right\}= f(\pi_X)$ due to the
nonlinearity of $f$, leading to a bias. In this paper we propose a black-box
debiasing scheme that improves the accuracy of such a naive plug-in approach.
For any integer $k$ and under boundedness of the likelihood and smoothness of
$f$, we generate samples $\hat{X}^{(1)},\dots,\hat{X}^{(k)}$ and weights
$w_1,\dots,w_k$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^kw_iP_{\hat{X}^{(i)}}$ is a $k$-th order
approximation of $f(\pi_X)$, where the generation process treats $f$ as a
black-box. Our generation process achieves higher accuracy when averaged over
the randomness of the training data, without degrading the variance, which can
be interpreted as improving memorization without compromising generalization in
generative models.

Abstract: Aerosol-cloud--radiation interactions remain among the most uncertain
components of the Earth's climate system, in partdue to the high dimensionality
of aerosol state representations and the difficulty of obtaining complete
\textit{in situ} measurements. Addressing these challenges requires methods
that distill complex aerosol properties into compact yet physically meaningful
forms. Generative autoencoder models provide such a pathway. We present a
framework for learning deep variational autoencoder (VAE) models of speciated
mass and number concentration distributions, which capture detailed aerosol
size-composition characteristics. By compressing hundreds of original
dimensions into ten latent variables, the approach enables efficient storage
and processing while preserving the fidelity of key diagnostics, including
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, optical scattering and absorption
coefficients, and ice nucleation properties. Results show that CCN spectra are
easiest to reconstruct accurately, optical properties are moderately difficult,
and ice nucleation properties are the most challenging. To improve performance,
we introduce a preprocessing optimization strategy that avoids repeated
retraining and yields latent representations resilient to high-magnitude
Gaussian noise, boosting accuracy for CCN spectra, optical coefficients, and
frozen fraction spectra. Finally, we propose a novel realism metric -- based on
the sliced Wasserstein distance between generated samples and a held-out test
set -- for optimizing the KL divergence weight in VAEs. Together, these
contributions enable compact, robust, and physically meaningful representations
of aerosol states for large-scale climate applications.

Abstract: Interactive composition simulations in Earth System Models (ESMs) are
computationally expensive as they transport numerous gaseous and aerosol
tracers at each timestep. This limits higher-resolution transient climate
simulations with current computational resources. ESMs like NASA GISS-ModelE3
(ModelE) often use pre-computed monthly-averaged atmospheric composition
concentrations (Non-Interactive Tracers or NINT) to reduce computational costs.
While NINT significantly cuts computations, it fails to capture real-time
feedback between aerosols and other climate processes by relying on
pre-calculated fields. We extended the ModelE NINT version using machine
learning (ML) to create Smart NINT, which emulates interactive emissions. Smart
NINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions
and meteorological data as inputs, avoiding full physics parameterizations. Our
approach utilizes a spatiotemporal architecture that possesses a well-matched
inductive bias to effectively capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in
tracer evolution. Input data processed through the first 20 vertical levels
(from the surface up to 656 hPa) using the ModelE OMA scheme. This vertical
range covers nearly the entire BCB concentration distribution in the
troposphere, where significant variation on short time horizons due to
surface-level emissions is observed. Our evaluation shows excellent model
performance with R-squared values of 0.92 and Pearson-r of 0.96 at the first
pressure level. This high performance continues through level 15 (808.5 hPa),
then gradually decreases as BCB concentrations drop significantly. The model
maintains acceptable performance even when tested on data from entirely
different periods outside the training domain, which is a crucial capability
for climate modeling applications requiring reliable long-term projections.

Abstract: Structured sparsity enables deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained systems. Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are
particularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing
the model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.
Despite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being
inherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann
architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by
performing computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs,
enable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data
movement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency. Nonetheless, naively
mapping sparse matrices onto CIM arrays leads to poor array utilization and
diminished computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an automated
framework with novel mapping and scheduling strategies to accelerate sparse LLM
inference on CIM accelerators. By exploiting block-diagonal sparsity, our
approach improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, achieving more than 4x
reduction in both memory footprint and the number of required floating-point
operations.

Motivation: 大规模细粒度移动数据难获取，现有研究常分开建模用户轨迹和移动流量，无法捕捉跨模态动态，需统一框架。

Method: 应用离散小波变换进行多分辨率流量分解；用混合去噪网络处理流量和位置序列；设计基于城市知识图谱嵌入相似度的过渡机制；用带交叉注意力的多尺度Transformer捕捉轨迹和流量依赖。

Result: MSTDiff在流量和轨迹生成任务中超越现有基线，流量生成关键统计指标JSD降低最多17.38%，轨迹生成平均降低39.53%。

Conclusion: MSTDiff能有效联合模拟移动流量和用户轨迹。

Abstract: User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide
spectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and
emergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data
remains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs,
making it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User
trajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both
physical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong
interdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the
ability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is
crucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer
for joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff
applies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition.
Second, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic
volumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban
knowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed
trajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention
captures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that
MSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory
generation tasks, reducing Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) across key
statistical metrics by up to 17.38% for traffic generation, and by an average
of 39.53% for trajectory generation. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 6G无线网络中带宽密集型应用增长，传统算法无法满足异构用户需求、资源利用率低，神经网络方法缺乏拓扑泛化和可扩展性。

Method: 将路由问题建模为受限最小流优化任务，用强化学习算法构建组播树，用图注意力网络提取节点嵌入，用长短期记忆模块建模路由决策的顺序依赖。

Result: 该方法接近基于动态规划的最优解，显著降低计算复杂度，对大规模和动态网络拓扑有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力用于6G多媒体实时传输场景。

Abstract: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G)
wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory
extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of
delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional
shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally
prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous
user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based
approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological
generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper
presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that
jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video
quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained
minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is
developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths
and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed
as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long
short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing
decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely
approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly
reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong
generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the
method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/GNN-Routing.

Method: 将有界双态内核与团可行比例公平授权头结合，进行小信号分析，在轻流量假设下证明几何遍历性并推导积压和延迟尾界，开展数值研究。

Result: 得出延迟相关阈值和频谱裕度，在固定增益下，NOS比PF和BP有更高利用率和更小99.9%分位延迟。

Conclusion: NOS调度器在6G无线接入中表现良好，能在保持团可行性的同时实现更好性能。

Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler
for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a
clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts
as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and
neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes.
A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$
and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress
topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under
light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta>0$ and
derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional
to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute
budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference
topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the
worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller
99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet
their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an
in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT,
Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and
image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label
two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained
prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI
apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one
comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions
on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed
traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end,
we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol
levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our
analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in
volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the
predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT
exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication
(SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution
to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in
GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging
apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic
characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as
sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring
and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and
foster extensions to other use cases.

Method: 提出基于MADDPG技术的MA - DRL网络控制框架，采用集中路由和分布式调度架构，结合网络领域知识设计策略，可集成数据驱动的DRL代理和传统规则策略。

Conclusion: 所提框架在控制延迟关键服务方面有效且高性能，揭示了数据驱动DRL代理和新规则策略的作用与相互关系。

Abstract: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous
networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications,
such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality.
However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay
performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency
guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets
within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the
Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,
and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel
MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and
distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical
networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based
on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where
centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths
and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby
maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework
allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}
agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance
between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the
superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic
optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and
interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both
efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.

Abstract: The advancement of machine learning for compiler optimization, particularly
within the polyhedral model, is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
public performance datasets. This data bottleneck forces researchers to
undertake costly data generation campaigns, slowing down innovation and
hindering reproducible research learned code optimization. To address this gap,
we introduce LOOPerSet, a new public dataset containing 28 million labeled data
points derived from 220,000 unique, synthetically generated polyhedral
programs. Each data point maps a program and a complex sequence of
semantics-preserving transformations (such as fusion, skewing, tiling, and
parallelism)to a ground truth performance measurement (execution time). The
scale and diversity of LOOPerSet make it a valuable resource for training and
evaluating learned cost models, benchmarking new model architectures, and
exploring the frontiers of automated polyhedral scheduling. The dataset is
released under a permissive license to foster reproducible research and lower
the barrier to entry for data-driven compiler optimization.

Result: LOCO对象性能与定制RDMA系统相当，编程模型更简单，便于形式化证明正确性。

Conclusion: LOCO库和Mowgli框架可助力在RDMA上构建多节点对象并验证其正确性。

Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a memory technology that allows remote
devices to directly write to and read from each other's memory, bypassing
components such as the CPU and operating system. This enables low-latency
high-throughput networking, as required for many modern data centres, HPC
applications and AI/ML workloads. However, baseline RDMA comprises a highly
permissive weak memory model that is difficult to use in practice and has only
recently been formalised. In this paper, we introduce the Library of Composable
Objects (LOCO), a formally verified library for building multi-node objects on
RDMA, filling the gap between shared memory and distributed system programming.
LOCO objects are well-encapsulated and take advantage of the strong locality
and the weak consistency characteristics of RDMA. They have performance
comparable to custom RDMA systems (e.g. distributed maps), but with a far
simpler programming model amenable to formal proofs of correctness. To support
verification, we develop a novel modular declarative verification framework,
called Mowgli, that is flexible enough to model multinode objects and is
independent of a memory consistency model. We instantiate Mowgli with the RDMA
memory model, and use it to verify correctness of LOCO libraries.

Conclusion: Herb.jl能解决程序综合方法复用和组合的问题。

Abstract: Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification
-- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and
many programmers' dream. Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle
program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially
growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist,
reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and
time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library
written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since
current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the
underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable
sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules.
To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases:
1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how
to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code,
and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.

TL;DR: 现有语言模型代码生成确保类型正确性困难，本文提出TyFlow系统内化类型推理，评估显示其消除类型错误且提升功能正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传统方法不能让模型有效内部学习类型推理，限制整体性能，需解决代码生成中类型正确性问题。

Method: 引入TyFlow系统，构建类型引导的程序合成系统，维持类型推导树和合成推导树的同构，采用基于合成决策序列的新代码表示。

Result: TyFlow消除了类型错误，显著提高了功能正确性。

Conclusion: 强调让大语言模型与类型系统内部对齐很重要。

Abstract: Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation;
nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although
traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by
externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively
learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall
performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes
type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type
system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis
system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and
synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on
synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token
sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the
representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward
higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only
eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness,
highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.

Motivation: 现有代码运行时优化方法使用代码大语言模型配合慢-快代码对作指导，但存在模糊性能提升因果因素、易导致表面模式模仿而非真正性能推理的问题。

Method: ECO从参考慢-快代码对中提炼运行时优化指令（ROI），对输入代码并行使用符号顾问进行瓶颈诊断和ROI检索器返回相关ROI，将二者输出组合成性能感知提示供代码大语言模型使用。

Result: ECO提示显著提高了代码大语言模型生成高效代码的能力，实现了高达7.81倍的加速，同时最大程度减少了正确性损失。

Conclusion: ECO是一种有效的代码优化提示框架，能提升代码大语言模型性能。

Abstract: Code runtime optimization-the task of rewriting a given code to a faster
one-remains challenging, as it requires reasoning about performance trade-offs
involving algorithmic and structural choices. Recent approaches employ
code-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such
pair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often
lead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance
reasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code
optimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from
reference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency
and the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code,
ECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck
diagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related
ROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt,
providing actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic,
require no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our
empirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves
code-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to
7.81x while minimizing correctness loss.

Conclusion: 这种自适应方法提高了激光 - 等离子体模拟的准确性和可扩展性，为高能密度和粒子加速应用提供统一预测框架。

Abstract: High-intensity laser plasma interactions create complex computational
problems because they involve both fluid and kinetic regimes, which need models
that maintain physical precision while keeping computational speed. The
research introduces a machine learning-based three-dimensional hybrid
fluid-particle-in-cell (PIC) system, which links relativistic plasma behavior
to automatic regime transitions. The technique employs fluid approximations for
stable areas but activates the PIC solver when SwitchNet directs it to unstable
sections through its training on physics-based synthetic data. The model uses a
smooth transition between Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling and
multiphoton ionization rates to simulate ionization, while Airy-function
approximations simulate quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects for radiation
reaction and pair production. The convolutional neural network applies energy
conservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized
fields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The
hybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination
(R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field
components. This adaptive approach enhances the accuracy and scalability of
laser-plasma simulations, providing a unified predictive framework for
high-energy-density and particle acceleration applications.

Abstract: In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly
available information has become fundamental for satellite operators to
guarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space
environment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of
publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The
goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data
against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed
Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as
non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of
real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify
discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published
ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds,
planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we
compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting
satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration
profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the
effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting
satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m,
while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this
in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available
data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and
importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in
mega-constellations.

TL;DR: 提出EvoCAD方法用视觉语言模型和进化优化生成CAD对象，在CADPrompt数据集评估，新指标显示其优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合大语言模型和进化计算算法，利用两者优势生成CAD对象。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型和进化优化，采样多个CAD对象并用进化方法结合视觉语言和推理语言模型优化。

Result: EvoCAD在多个指标上优于先前方法，尤其在生成拓扑正确对象方面，新指标可有效评估。

Conclusion: EvoCAD是一种有效的生成CAD对象的方法，新指标能补充现有空间指标。

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT - Batten框架，用少量训练案例从儿科脑MRI检测早期Batten病，模型性能优，可解释性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病早期MRI迹象细微易漏诊，且训练案例有限，需有效方法检测。

Method: 将大的教师ViT蒸馏成5M参数的TinyViT，用基于度量的少样本学习微调。

Result: 在多站点数据集上准确率约91%，ROC曲线下面积至少0.95，优于3D - ResNet和Swin - Tiny基线。

Conclusion: 模型尺寸小、性能强，是早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the Ultralytics YOLO(You Only
Look Once) family of object detectors, focusing the architectural evolution,
benchmarking, deployment perspectives, and future challenges. The review begins
with the most recent release, YOLO26 (YOLOv26), which introduces key
innovations including Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal, native NMS-free
inference, Progressive Loss Balancing (ProgLoss), Small-Target-Aware Label
Assignment (STAL), and the MuSGD optimizer for stable training. The progression
is then traced through YOLO11, with its hybrid task assignment and
efficiency-focused modules; YOLOv8, which advanced with a decoupled detection
head and anchor-free predictions; and YOLOv5, which established the modular
PyTorch foundation that enabled modern YOLO development. Benchmarking on the MS
COCO dataset provides a detailed quantitative comparison of YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLO11, and YOLO26, alongside cross-comparisons with YOLOv12, YOLOv13, RT-DETR,
and DEIM. Metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, mean Average
Precision, and inference speed are analyzed to highlight trade-offs between
accuracy and efficiency. Deployment and application perspectives are further
discussed, covering export formats, quantization strategies, and real-world use
in robotics, agriculture, surveillance, and manufacturing. Finally, the paper
identifies challenges and future directions, including dense-scene limitations,
hybrid CNN-Transformer integration, open-vocabulary detection, and edge-aware
training approaches.

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究这些任务成功的预测特征。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

TL;DR: 提出CHUG数据集用于UGC-HDR视频质量评估，含大量UGC-HDR视频及主观评分，公开可用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR-VQA数据集主要针对PGC，缺乏对UGC-HDR视频的研究，需填补这一空白。

Method: 收集856个UGC-HDR源视频，经多分辨率和比特率转码，通过Amazon Mechanical Turk收集主观评分。

Result: 得到包含5992个视频、211848个感知评分的CHUG数据集。

Conclusion: CHUG为分析UGC特定失真提供基准，有望推动NR HDR-VQA研究。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂环境下传统导航不可靠，高光谱成像为无人机计算机视觉提供机会，需开发集成高光谱成像的深度学习架构用于无人机感知。

Method: 修改Mobile 3D Vision Transformer，引入SpectralCA块，采用双向交叉注意力融合光谱和空间特征。

Conclusion: 所提架构能提高无人机感知效率，可用于导航、目标识别和环境监测等实时任务。

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

Motivation: 水下图像在海洋研究和监测中重要，但环境致图像质量差，现有图像增强研究有局限性，数据集存在多样性和质量问题。

Method: 一方面用去噪扩散模型扩充数据集，纳入多种类型图像；另一方面用Controlnet增强图像以提升数据集质量。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该计划可克服现有研究局限性，有助于改善海洋生态系统研究。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型在真实场景依赖虚假关联而失败，需要提升其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出人在环交互式框架，将人类修正作为干预信号，在相似图像传播修正信息。

Result: 在挑战性数据上提升分割准确率，减少标注工作量，在基准数据集保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应真实场景的分割系统提供实用框架。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型多为单次推理，忽略局部视觉线索，与人类专家诊断过程存在差距，需缩小此差距。

Method: 引入ViTAR框架，采用“思考 - 行动 - 反思 - 回答”认知链；策划高质量指令数据集和视觉问答训练数据；采用两阶段训练策略，先监督微调，后强化学习。

Result: ViTAR表现优于强大的现有模型；视觉注意力分析显示其在推理中更关注关键临床区域。

Conclusion: 将专家式迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可提升医疗AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法难平衡效率和可靠性，紧凑型模型有误报和漏检问题，传统后处理方法有局限。

Method: 提出不确定感知后检测框架，用统计不确定性和视觉线索重新缩放检测置信度，轻量级置信度细化网络结合特征调整检测分数。

Result: 在D - Fire数据集实验中，相比基线模型，精度、召回率和平均精度均值提升，计算开销小。

Conclusion: 后检测重新评分能增强紧凑型深度学习模型在现实火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Motivation: 图像篡改带来安全威胁，有监督图像篡改定位依赖昂贵像素级标注，现有弱监督或无训练方法表现不佳且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出In - Context Forensic Chain (ICFC)框架，结合对象化规则构建与自适应过滤构建知识库，采用多步渐进推理管道。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC超越了现有无训练方法，与弱监督和全监督方法相比也有竞争力或更优。

Conclusion: ICFC是一种有效的、可解释的图像篡改定位无训练框架。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Motivation: 当前用自编码器处理低光和黑暗图像时SSIM和PSNR分数低、计算量大，且图像超分辨率处理有需求。

Method: 开发DeepFusionNet架构，还开发基于该架构的自编码器超分辨率模型。

Result: 在LOL - v1数据集上，DeepFusionNet的SSIM达92.8%，PSNR为26.30，参数约250万；基于DeepFusionNet的超分辨率方法在验证集上PSNR为25.30，SSIM为80.7%，参数约10万。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet架构在低光图像转换和图像超分辨率问题上有较好效果。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要关注简单表达，处理复杂表达时存在局限性，无法应对指称歧义，因此需解决现实中的对象干扰和类别隐式表达挑战。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，模仿人类两阶段认知过程，利用Mamba的特性实现高效多周期细化；引入aRefCOCO基准评估模型。

Result: 在标准和新提出的数据集上进行大量实验，SaFiRe表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SaFiRe框架和aRefCOCO基准能有效提升RIS模型处理复杂表达的能力，具有优越性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有物体姿态估计方法主要关注物体前表面，忽略后表面和内部信息，为更好利用物体全表面和内部信息来提升姿态估计精度。

Method: 预测物体前后表面3D坐标并在其间密集采样3D坐标，创建超密集2D - 3D对应关系，基于PnP算法提升精度；提出Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE)编码。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，提出的方法优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的结合超密集2D - 3D对应关系和HCCE编码的方法能有效提升物体姿态估计精度。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Residual Networks (ResNet) to
classify brain tumors effectively. Additionally, we investigate the use of
U-Net for semantic segmentation and EfficientDet for anchor-based object
detection to enhance the localization and identification of tumors. Our results
demonstrate promising improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of brain
tumor diagnostics, underscoring the potential of deep learning in medical
imaging and its significance in improving clinical outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景数据有限，生成不同物体姿态的逼真场景是具有挑战的开放任务。

Method: 引入分解表示将场景分解为房间程序和物体姿态概念；学习捕捉可复用布局模式的函数库，用大语言模型生成高级程序；学习程序条件模型预测物体姿态并放置3D物体。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真现实房间。

Conclusion: FactoredScenes框架能有效合成逼真3D场景。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Motivation: AI驱动作物健康映射系统受稀疏航空影像数据集正交镶嵌图生成技术限制，难以广泛被农民采用，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出基于光流的Ortho - Fuse框架，采用中间流估计合成过渡图像，增加特征对应关系。

Result: 实验验证可使最小重叠要求降低20%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架可降低重叠要求，还对精准农业中AI驱动监测系统的集成途径进行了分析。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

TL;DR: 文章讨论CNN黑箱问题及隐藏偏差，提出两种方法在六个数据集测试，能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN以数据驱动方式选特征形成黑箱，决策过程可能受难检测的背景信息影响，需识别隐藏偏差。

Method: 一是将图像分成不同大小非重叠小块并随机打乱；二是应用傅里叶、小波变换、中值滤波及其组合。

Result: 该方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，无需背景信息也可警示背景噪声存在。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可解决CNN决策受背景信息影响问题，有效识别隐藏偏差。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态识别方法存在受视角、遮挡和噪声影响，多模态方法计算成本高的问题，需改进。

Method: 引入Mesh - Gait框架，直接从2D轮廓重建3D表示，以3D热图为中间表示，在监督学习下逐步重建并计算损失，高效提取特征。

Result: Mesh - Gait在实验中达到了先进的精度。

Conclusion: Mesh - Gait框架有效结合2D和3D模态优势，避免直接3D重建的高开销，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Result: 在BRIAR数据集上，该方法在步态识别上优于现有方法，并能准确进行属性估计。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习在现实场景中基于步态的人类理解方面有很大潜力。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HuLiRAG框架解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的问题，经实验验证可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中存在幻觉问题，现有RAG方法有局限性，无法实现类人处理。

Method: 提出HuLiRAG框架，将多模态推理分为“what - where - reweight”级联，通过开放词汇检测、SAM掩码、权衡局部和全局对齐等步骤，并用掩码引导微调注入空间证据。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该类人级联提高了定位保真度和事实一致性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架使多模态问答向可信推理迈进。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在杂乱场景中易忽略小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位出错。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行直线变换，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，不改变模型权重和架构。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLMs上，AttWarp持续提高准确率、增强组合推理能力、减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的变换能在保留上下文的同时优先处理与查询相关的信息，相同的MLLMs使用变换后的输入表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

Result: 在具有挑战性的CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了92.11%和90.72%的Dice分数，达到了SOTA。

Conclusion: 将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为医疗领域更强大、可信的AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Result: 谨慎加入一定数量合成图像或在训练中逐步添加真实图像可提升泛化能力，随意使用合成数据性能不佳，仅用合成数据等错误率最高。

Conclusion: 在单变形攻击检测的实际场景中，不应仅依赖合成数据。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Result: 以LLaVA - 1.5为基线的实验显示，模型在多个基准测试中无外部监督下能自主实现稳定改进。

Conclusion: 本研究对VLMs自完善能力的见解有望启发VLMs学习机制的未来研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Conclusion: GLOFNet解决了一些挑战，为多模态深度学习方法在罕见灾害预测中的基准测试提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Conclusion: FedCoPL是解决UFL分类问题的有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time

YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Motivation: 视频文本研究发展促使将图像模型扩展到视频领域，图像到视频迁移学习可缓解从头训练视频语言基础模型的数据和计算需求，本文旨在对该新兴领域进行全面综述。

Method: 总结常用ILFM及其能力；将现有图像到视频迁移学习策略分为冻结特征和修改特征两类；阐述策略在不同视频文本学习任务中的应用；进行实验分析不同迁移范式在下游视频理解任务中的效果。

Result: 对图像到视频迁移学习进行了系统分类和详细阐述，通过实验分析了不同迁移范式的效果。

Conclusion: 本文为基于现有ILFM推进视频文本学习建立了结构化路线图，指出了当前挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

### [610] [Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257)
*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出优化框架提升3D高斯 splatting在少样本场景下的效率，在紧凑性上有显著提升并达到新的帕累托最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯 splatting在少样本场景下标准的自适应密度控制会导致过拟合和臃肿的重建，现有方法提升质量时会大幅增加基元数量，因此需提高效率。

Method: 用基于不透明度梯度的新型致密化触发器替代标准位置梯度启发式方法，配合更保守的剪枝策略，结合标准深度相关损失进行几何引导。

Result: 在3 - view LLFF数据集上比FSGS模型紧凑超40%，在Mip - NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%，在重建指标上有适度权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架在少样本视图合成的质量与效率帕累托前沿达到新的最优。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

Motivation: 探索可用于PPG生理任务的基础模型，提升任务性能。

Method: 将一维PPG信号转换为二维图像表示，利用最新VFMs如DINOv3和SIGLIP - 2，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术。

Result: VFM在许多PPG任务上取得SOTA性能，Vision4PPG对其他二维输入表示有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 为临床科学家提供计算高效的新工具，全面研究表明VFM在PPG处理上表现出色。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Conclusion: DISC - GAN框架在水下图像合成上表现优异，具有良好性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法处理点云时忽略结构和语义细节，特征融合和区分性有限。

Method: 使用全局 - 局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征关联和捕获全局信息；采用多分支特征提取网络捕获邻域信息和增强轮廓特征区分性；引入深度特征引导注意力机制的特征融合方法提高跨通道特征融合精度。

Result: DAGLFNet在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集分别达到69.83%和78.65%。

Conclusion: 该方法平衡高性能与实时性，在基于LiDAR实时应用有很大潜力。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理多模态缺失尤其是不平衡缺失率时存在局限，如只关注全局平衡，忽略样本级差异和特征质量下降问题。

Method: 提出Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE)方法，包含Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE)和Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE)两个组件。

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试中，MCE在各种缺失配置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCE方法有效解决了多模态学习中处理缺失模态尤其是不平衡缺失率的问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The
journal preprint version is now available at

Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中可能加剧医疗差距，需解决不同人口统计群体间的性能差异问题。

Conclusion: 为临床放射学中公平的深度学习部署提供了实用有效的途径。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型因低秩投影结构和均匀注意力分布，导致表达能力下降、类别可分性降低、分类能力受限。

Method: 提出混合框架，在值矩阵附加门控局部图网络分支提高注意力图的秩；引入可学习的对数幂函数到注意力分数中减少熵、增强聚焦。

Result: 在同构和异构图基准上的大量实验表明，方法取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法能在保留线性注意力可扩展性的同时，有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅适用于视觉 - 语言模型，还为表示学习中引入拓扑对齐提供通用方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial

Result: 在具有挑战性的现实基准和实时VR环境的大量实验中，该方法在所有指标上表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，可用于主动VR系统预测用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

TL;DR: 提出Chart - RVR框架，用GRPO和可验证奖励微调LVLMs用于图表推理，性能超SFT且提升解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在OOD数据和生成CoT理由时表现不佳，限制可解释性，需更鲁棒和可解释的图表推理方法。

Method: 提出Chart - RVR框架，结合GRPO与可验证奖励，有三种最大化奖励。

Result: 应用于30亿参数LVLMs，在分布内和分布外数据集上超SFT，Chart - RVR - 3B系列在六个基准测试中达SOTA。

Conclusion: Chart - RVR提升了准确性和CoT理由的可解释性，展示了GRPO与可验证奖励训练可靠可解释图表推理模型的能力。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

Result: 梳理了Agentic MLLMs的概念基础和特征，建立了概念框架，整理了相关资源。

Conclusion: 对Agentic MLLMs进行了全面总结，指出其下游应用和未来研究方向，还会更新公共仓库跟踪领域发展。

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅助线对解决复杂几何问题重要，但LVLMs处理有挑战，现有图像编辑模型画辅助线缺乏几何精度。

Method: 生成辅助线构造的文本描述，提出强化学习框架增强图 - 文对齐，用跨模态奖励评估，基于GRPO进行RL阶段，开发数据创建管道并构建数据集。

Result: GeoVLMath在3B和7B规模下，在辅助线推理基准测试中与强大的开源和专有LVLMs相比，取得有竞争力且常更优的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法和模型能有效解决LVLMs处理几何辅助线的问题。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源有限环境中部署大型深度学习模型进行肺炎诊断的难题，提供可访问且准确的诊断方案。

Method: 从头构建LightPneumoNet模型，在含5856张胸部X光图像的公开数据集上训练，进行图像预处理和数据增强，采用自定义架构。

Result: 在独立测试集上，模型准确率0.942、精确率0.92、F1分数0.96、敏感度0.99。

Conclusion: 模型效率高，可部署在低成本硬件上，能在资源匮乏的诊所提供辅助诊断，改善患者预后。

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无源目标检测方法局限于传统模型，缺乏针对DETR架构的适配。

Method: 提出FRANCK框架，含OSSR、CMMB、UQFD模块和DTUI自训练流程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: FRANCK框架有效且与基于DETR的无源目标检测模型兼容。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Result: 在真实数据集实验中，该方法在涉及文本注释的符号识别任务上优于现有方法，处理复杂CAD图纸时鲁棒性更好。

Conclusion: 所提结合文本注释的框架能有效解决现有CAD图纸全景符号识别方法的问题。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

TL;DR: 本文提出新的OOD分数ΔEnergy和统一微调框架，提升视觉语言模型在OOD检测和泛化上的性能，实验表现优于近期方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型应用于下游任务时会遇到ID和OOD数据，需提升对协变量偏移的OOD数据泛化能力并有效检测语义偏移的OOD类别。

Method: 受模态重新对齐时闭集数据能量变化启发，引入ΔEnergy分数；通过对ΔEnergy进行下界最大化（EBM）提升协变量偏移下的OOD泛化能力；开发统一微调框架。

Result: ΔEnergy显著优于基于能量的OOD分数；EBM理论上能增强OOD检测和泛化；实验中方法在AUROC上比近期方法高10% - 25%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在OOD检测和泛化上表现优越，可提升视觉语言模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测监督学习需大量标注成本，零样本检测虽无需标注但精度低，因此要对比两者成本效益。

Method: 在1000张分层COCO图像和200张多样产品图像上系统评估，结合详细的总体拥有成本建模。

Result: 监督YOLO在标准类别精度91.2% ，零样本Gemini为68.5% ；Gemini在多样产品类别有精度，YOLO为0% ；低推理量时Gemini单检测成本低。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算和精度要求，而非单纯技术指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Motivation: 当前视频理解大语言模型难以扩展，离线和流式处理方法存在局限。

Method: 提出video - SALMONN S模型，引入测试时训练（TTT）内存模块和提示依赖的内存读取器，TTT模块用无Hessian共轭梯度程序（TTT_HF）优化。

Result: 在长视频基准测试中，能对多小时、10k帧和100万标记的视频保持高质量理解，8B参数模型表现优于基线。

Conclusion: video - SALMONN S模型在长视频处理上有效，解决了现有模型扩展难的问题。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Conclusion: 所提出的大规模模型蒸馏方法是一种数据和参数高效的方式，能在无过高计算负担下实现癌症特定应用的千兆级性能。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Method: 提出新框架，用不完美伪标签让现成扩散模型适应目标域，过滤生成结果、纠正标签对齐、统一语义。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上，分割mIoU比现有方法最多高8.0%pt，快速构建的合成数据集与高成本数据集效果相当。

Conclusion: 快速语义原型与生成模型结合，为城市场景理解提供可扩展、高质量训练数据创建范式。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个先进骨干网络上实验，MS - Mix始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS - Mix建立了鲁棒的多模态情感增强新标准。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting
of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the
structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition
performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the

respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional
neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource
settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning
approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning
and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.

Conclusion: NV3D模型在自动驾驶3D目标检测中性能优越，尤其是汽车和自行车检测。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SEM图像标尺确定主要依赖手动操作，耗时且易出错，需自动化方法解决。

Method: 提出四阶段框架，包括自动数据集生成、标尺目标检测、混合光学字符识别信息提取、LLM分析验证结果。

Result: 目标检测精度高，混合OCR系统表现优于主流独立引擎，LLM可辅助推理和验证。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法提升了SEM图像标尺检测提取的效率和准确性，推动科学成像领域发展。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

TL;DR: 本文探索用预训练表征编码器替代VAE用于扩散变压器，提出解决方案并验证，取得良好图像生成结果，认为RAE应成新默认选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变压器中VAE编码器存在架构过时、潜在空间维度低、表征弱等局限，影响生成质量。

Method: 用预训练表征编码器与训练好的解码器组成表征自编码器（RAE），分析在高维潜在空间中扩散变压器有效运行的困难来源，提出理论解决方案并实证验证。

Result: 实现更快收敛，在ImageNet上取得强图像生成结果，256x256无引导FID为1.51，256x256和512x512有引导FID为1.13。

Conclusion: RAE有明显优势，应成为扩散变压器训练的新默认选择。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用无标签领域数据训练ControlNet的方法，通过引入不确定性控制机制生成标注数据，在视网膜OCT和交通场景实验中取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet在增强判别模型训练分布时效果有限，倾向于重现原始训练分布，且存在领域差异问题，如视网膜OCT不同设备图像质量和领域差异大。

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合无标签数据集的不确定性控制和有标签数据集的语义控制来训练ControlNet。

Result: 能从目标领域创建高不确定性的标注数据，在视网膜OCT和交通场景实验中显著提升分割效果。

Conclusion: 所提方法能弥合领域差距，无需额外监督提升分割结果，相比风格迁移能实现任意领域转换。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Motivation: 现有智能工作流主要关注文本质量，忽略文档视觉结构和风格，缺乏合适奖励模型引导生成高质量结构和风格的文档。

Method: 提出DocReward文档奖励模型，构建多领域数据集DocPair训练，用Bradley - Terry损失函数评分，创建测试数据集评估。

Result: DocReward在准确率上比GPT - 4o和GPT - 5分别高30.6和19.4个百分点；在文档生成外部评估中胜率达60.8%，高于GPT - 5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward在评估文档结构与风格上优于基线模型，能有效引导生成代理生成人类偏好的文档。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Motivation: 准确评估视频扩散模型直观物理理解能力是挑战，因难以区分生成中的物理正确性和视觉外观。

Method: 引入LikePhys训练-free方法，在经过精心挑选的有效-无效视频对数据集上，用去噪目标作为基于ELBO的似然替代，区分物理上有效和不可能的视频。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了LikePhys方法的有效性，指出当前模型物理理解能力有提升趋势，同时强调了模型设计和推理设置对直观物理理解的影响。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法提取的概念难以与模型真正决策过程对齐，影响解释忠实性。

Method: 提出FACE框架，用KL散度正则化项增强NMF，概念学习时加入分类器监督。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上系统评估，FACE在忠实性和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACE能确保模型原始预测和基于概念的预测对齐，实现忠实解释。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Conclusion: 必须制定AI辅助综述写作规范，恢复专家监督和透明度，开发新基础设施来保障研究社区综述的完整性。

Abstract: Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research
communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts
across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys,
especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this
traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output.
While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical
threat: the phenomenon we term the "survey paper DDoS attack" to the research
community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially
comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey
manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and
erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we
must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey
paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for
AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and
transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as
Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories
that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend
analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that
safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to
the research community.

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Since the beginning of the vaccination trial, social media has been flooded
with anti-vaccination comments and conspiracy beliefs. As the day passes, the
number of COVID- 19 cases increases, and online platforms and a few news
portals entertain sharing different conspiracy theories. The most popular
conspiracy belief was the link between the 5G network spreading COVID-19 and
the Chinese government spreading the virus as a bioweapon, which initially
created racial hatred. Although some disbelief has less impact on society,
others create massive destruction. For example, the 5G conspiracy led to the
burn of the 5G Tower, and belief in the Chinese bioweapon story promoted an
attack on the Asian-Americans. Another popular conspiracy belief was that Bill
Gates spread this Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by launching a mass
vaccination program to track everyone. This Conspiracy belief creates distrust
issues among laypeople and creates vaccine hesitancy. This study aims to
discover the conspiracy theory against the vaccine on social platforms. We
performed a sentiment analysis on the 598 unique sample comments related to
COVID-19 vaccines. We used two different models, BERT and Perspective API, to
find out the sentiment and toxicity of the sentence toward the COVID-19
vaccine.

Abstract: Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformative potential for public
sector services, decision-making, and administrative efficiency, adoption
remains uneven due to complex technical, organizational, and institutional
challenges. Responsible AI frameworks emphasize fairness, accountability, and
transparency, aligning with principles of trustworthy AI and fair AI, yet
remain largely aspirational, overlooking technical and institutional realities,
especially foundational data and governance. This study addresses this gap by
developing a taxonomy of data-related challenges to responsible AI adoption in
government. Based on a systematic review of 43 studies and 21 expert
evaluations, the taxonomy identifies 13 key challenges across technological,
organizational, and environmental dimensions, including poor data quality,
limited AI-ready infrastructure, weak governance, misalignment in human-AI
decision-making, economic and environmental sustainability concerns. Annotated
with institutional pressures, the taxonomy serves as a diagnostic tool to
surface 'symptoms' of high-risk AI deployment and guides policymakers in
building the institutional and data governance conditions necessary for
responsible AI adoption.

Abstract: Selecting a college major is a difficult decision for many incoming freshmen.
Traditional academic advising is often hindered by long wait times,
intimidating environments, and limited personalization. AI Chatbots present an
opportunity to address these challenges. However, AI systems also have the
potential to generate biased responses, prejudices related to race, gender,
socioeconomic status, and disability. These biases risk turning away potential
students and undermining reliability of AI systems. This study aims to develop
a University of Maryland (UMD) A. James Clark School of Engineering
Program-specific AI chatbot. Our research team analyzed and mitigated potential
biases in the responses. Through testing the chatbot on diverse student
queries, the responses are scored on metrics of accuracy, relevance,
personalization, and bias presence. The results demonstrate that with careful
prompt engineering and bias mitigation strategies, AI chatbots can provide
high-quality, unbiased academic advising support, achieving mean scores of 9.76
for accuracy, 9.56 for relevance, and 9.60 for personalization with no
stereotypical biases found in the sample data. However, due to the small sample
size and limited timeframe, our AI model may not fully reflect the nuances of
student queries in engineering academic advising. Regardless, these findings
will inform best practices for building ethical AI systems in higher education,
offering tools to complement traditional advising and address the inequities

TL;DR: 欧盟及其成员国资助项目申请评估遇瓶颈，本文介绍AI辅助评估在两个政府项目中的应用，证实AI提升效率、减轻工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟资助项目申请增多，人力评估能力有限，评估流程出现瓶颈。

Method: 在企业国际业务拓展申请和公民节能家居投资报销申请两个政府项目中部署AI辅助评估。

Result: AI有效提升处理效率、减轻工作量，公民报销申请项目中，评审员生产力提高20.1%，假阳性率可忽略不计，总评估时间减少超2个月。

Conclusion: AI驱动的自动化在大规模评估工作流程中有显著作用。

Abstract: Every year, the European Union and its member states allocate millions of
euros to fund various development initiatives. However, the increasing number
of applications received for these programs often creates significant
bottlenecks in evaluation processes, due to limited human capacity. In this
work, we detail the real-world deployment of AI-assisted evaluation within the
pipeline of two government initiatives: (i) corporate applications aimed at
international business expansion, and (ii) citizen reimbursement claims for
investments in energy-efficient home improvements. While these two cases
involve distinct evaluation procedures, our findings confirm that AI
effectively enhanced processing efficiency and reduced workload across both
types of applications. Specifically, in the citizen reimbursement claims
initiative, our solution increased reviewer productivity by 20.1%, while
keeping a negligible false-positive rate based on our test set observations.
These improvements resulted in an overall reduction of more than 2 months in
the total evaluation time, illustrating the impact of AI-driven automation in
large-scale evaluation workflows.

Motivation: 高等教育CT教育研究不足，且缺乏AI融入CT教育的全面概述，需填补此空白。

Method: 进行系统文献综述研究。

Result: 识别高等教育中应用AI的CT教育举措，探索其多方面教育内容。

Conclusion: 为CT教育界提供实用和科学贡献，包括相关举措清单、AI融入的多方面概述及新视角洞察。

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher
education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and
workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K12
over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education,
leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and
support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial
intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising
potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines,
including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various
aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To
mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The
focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education
within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these
initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education,
instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and
models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to
the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for
CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating
AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to
reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and
insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the
decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT).

Abstract: Understanding and predicting pedestrian dynamics has become essential for
shaping safer, more responsive, and human-centered urban environments. This
study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on
data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its
intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data
from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix
to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers.
Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban
informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks,
transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field
increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital
twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring
interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting
methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how
data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for
adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究引入时空可达性指标评估其对休闲参与的影响，验证指标有效性并强调以人为主的可达性指标价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可达性衡量方法忽略日常活动约束和机会，为促进包容活力的城市生活，需理解可达性对休闲活动参与的影响。

Method: 引入基于能力方法的时空可达性指标，利用巴黎地区2415名居民的高分辨率GPS数据，结合结构方程模型进行分析。

Result: 多数人选择的目的地符合指标定义的机会集，指标能有效捕捉能力集；时空可达性直接促进休闲多样性，也减少出行时间，但出行时间减少与多样性降低有关。

Conclusion: 以人为主、基于能力的可达性指标对理解城市出行不平等和制定交通规划策略有重要价值。

Abstract: Understanding how accessibility shapes participation in leisure activities is
central to promoting inclusive and vibrant urban life. Conventional
accessibility measures often focus on potential access from fixed home
locations, overlooking the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily
routines. In this study, we introduce a space-time accessibility (SPA) metric
rooted in the capability approach, capturing feasible leisure opportunities
between home and work given a certain time budget, individual transport modes,
and urban infrastructure. Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents
in the Paris region, we assess how SPA influences total travel time and leisure
participation, measured as the diversity of leisure activity locations. Spatial
patterns show that most individuals-especially active transport users-choose
destinations aligned with their SPA-defined opportunity sets, underscoring the
metric's validity in capturing capability sets. Structural equation modeling
reveals that SPA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel
time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity. These findings
highlight the value of person-centered, capability-informed accessibility
metrics for understanding inequalities in urban mobility and informing
transport planning strategies that expand real freedoms to participate in
social life across diverse population groups.

Motivation: 传统构建自定义数据分析平台需大量软件工程专业知识，限制了很多研究人员的使用，旨在降低这一障碍。

Method: 采用“氛围编码”，即用户用自然语言描述目标，AI 代理实时生成、测试和优化可执行代码。

Result: 用氛围编码在不到十分钟内、仅用四个自然语言提示、花费不到 2 美元创建了功能齐全的蛋白质组学数据分析网站，而以往工作需专业程序员投入数万美元。

Conclusion: 氛围编码使领域专家能快速搭建复杂分析工具，改变了计算生物学软件开发的速度和可及性。

Abstract: Building custom data analysis platforms traditionally requires extensive
software engineering expertise, limiting accessibility for many researchers.
Here, I demonstrate that modern large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
coding agents can dramatically lower this barrier through a process called
'vibe coding', an iterative, conversational style of software creation where
users describe goals in natural language and AI agents generate, test, and
refine executable code in real-time. As a proof of concept, I used Vibe coding
to create a fully functional proteomics data analysis website capable of
performing standard tasks, including data normalization, differential
expression testing, and volcano plot visualization. The entire application,
including user interface, backend logic, and data upload pipeline, was
developed in less than ten minutes using only four natural-language prompts,
without any manual coding, at a cost of under $2. Previous works in this area
typically require tens of thousands of dollars in research effort from highly
trained programmers. I detail the step-by-step generation process and evaluate
the resulting code's functionality. This demonstration highlights how vibe
coding enables domain experts to rapidly prototype sophisticated analytical
tools, transforming the pace and accessibility of computational biology
software development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构工程领域传统且停滞，工作流程多年未变，而大语言模型在复杂推理等能力上与结构工程任务契合，希望借助其改进结构工程。

Method: 提出基于大语言模型的无训练多智能体系统MASSE。

Result: 在实际案例研究中，能将专家工作量从约两小时减至几分钟，提升实际工程场景的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: MASSE可立即部署在专业环境，能有效自动化多数实际结构工程工作流程。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural
Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents
with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental
yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely
unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market
size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to
perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization
-- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as
interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying
structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most
real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a
training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment
in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world
case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately
two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in
practical engineering scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在追逃游戏中，在没有先验逃避者位置信息的情况下有效定位追捕者的挑战。

Method: 结合博弈论控制理论与图神经网络，将追捕者配置概念化为战略安排并表示为图，通过多目标优化构建图特征空间以确定帕累托最优配置，用这些图训练GCN生成“热启动”初始配置。

Result: GCN生成的“热启动”配置比随机配置有显著优势，在多追捕者和逃避者场景中，能加速逃避者生存率下降、减少追捕者行进距离、增强围堵效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在追逃游戏中具有明显的战略优势。

Abstract: Effectively positioning pursuers in pursuit-evasion games without prior
knowledge of evader locations remains a significant challenge. A novel approach
that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is
introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic
arrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is
constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal
configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these
Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial
configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the
GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random
configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this
method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel
distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法未充分利用智能体间耦合信息，需要更高效可扩展的算法用于大规模多智能体系统。

Method: 通过贝叶斯网络建模合作MARL问题，定义值依赖集；提出P - DTDE范式；推导基于P - DTDE方案的多智能体策略梯度定理；开发可扩展的演员 - 评论家算法；对密集值依赖集提出基于贝叶斯网络截断的近似方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的利用智能体间耦合结构的方法及相关算法在多智能体强化学习中是有效且可扩展的，近似方案对密集值依赖集问题有更好的收敛性。

Abstract: The empirical success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has
motivated the search for more efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale
multi-agent systems. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully
exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this
paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the
inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model
the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset
of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by
each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we
propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE)
paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the
total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the
centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator.
We derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and
develop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and
scalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation
and multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets,
we propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network
and empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value
dependence set for applications with a large number of agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS中物理与数字环境集成面临系统异质性和复杂性挑战，传统方法缺乏语义丰富性和灵活性。

Method: 引入KG - MAS，利用集中式知识图谱作为动态共享世界模型，供多智能体系统决策和更新信息，采用模型驱动架构。

Result: KG - MAS可抽象底层通信协议，提供统一智能协调机制。

Conclusion: KG - MAS是耦合异构物理和数字机器人环境的强大、可扩展且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The seamless integration of physical and digital environments in
Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS), particularly within Industry 4.0, presents
significant challenges stemming from system heterogeneity and complexity.
Traditional approaches often rely on rigid, data-centric solutions like
co-simulation frameworks or brittle point-to-point middleware bridges, which
lack the semantic richness and flexibility required for intelligent, autonomous
coordination. This report introduces the Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent
Infrastructure(KG-MAS), as resolution in addressing such limitations. KG-MAS
leverages a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) as a dynamic, shared world model,
providing a common semantic foundation for a Multi-Agent System(MAS).
Autonomous agents, representing both physical and digital components, query
this KG for decision-making and update it with real-time state information. The
infrastructure features a model-driven architecture which facilitates the
automatic generation of agents from semantic descriptions, thereby simplifying
system extension and maintenance. By abstracting away underlying communication
protocols and providing a unified, intelligent coordination mechanism, KG-MAS
offers a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for coupling heterogeneous
physical and digital robotic environments.

<details>

Motivation: 传统访问控制机制无法应对基于大语言模型代理的自主性和上下文复杂性，需要范式转变。

Method: 引入AAC框架，包含多维上下文评估和自适应响应制定两个核心模块，由专用访问控制推理引擎驱动。

Result: 提出新的信息治理模型和框架。

Conclusion: AAC框架为可信代理设计的未来研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional
access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems
designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage
the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position
paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more
sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge
is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We
introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a
dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on
two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses
not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2)
adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions
to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This
vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap
between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new
conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.

Motivation: 测试时扩展策略在基于大语言模型的Text2SQL系统实际应用中的有效性不确定，尤其是最新的推理模型，需要研究其实际效果。

Method: 对六种轻量级、面向行业的测试时扩展策略和四种大语言模型（包括两种推理模型）在BIRD Mini - Dev基准上进行基准测试，除标准准确率指标外，还报告推理延迟和令牌消耗。

Result: 分治法提示和少样本演示能持续提升通用和推理型大语言模型的性能，引入额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择至关重要。

Conclusion: 明确了部署Text2SQL系统时在准确性、效率和复杂性之间的实际权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，小模型也能在多跳QA中展现强大查询扩展能力和高准确率。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

Conclusion: 词汇和表示空间在训练中共同优化并趋向最优解，为未来工作提供新想法和见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Conclusion: ImCoref - CeS框架有效，能结合监督模型和大语言模型优势提升共指消解性能。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

Motivation: 探索如何更好地表示从树状结构中检索的知识以生成结构化数据响应。

Method: 提出自底向上方法线性化树状结构知识，生成各级隐式聚合摘要，存入知识库用于RAG，并与处理原始代码的RAG对比。

Result: 两种方法响应质量相当，但新方法在检索器中生成的文档减少超68%，效率提升显著。

Conclusion: 利用隐式线性化知识处理复杂分层数据结构是高效且可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

TL;DR: 研究引入并探究大语言模型特定效用概念，发现人工标注段落并非对所有大语言模型最优，提出该效用判断基准程序并评估现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将检索增强生成（RAG）中的效用视为通用属性，忽略不同大语言模型从同一段落获效益不同的情况。

Method: 通过跨多个数据集和大语言模型的大规模实验，提出大语言模型特定效用判断的基准程序，在六个数据集上评估现有效用判断方法。

Result: 人工标注段落对大语言模型并非最优，真实效用段落不可跨不同大语言模型转移；使用伪答案的语言化方法表现稳健，但大语言模型难以有效评估效用。

Conclusion: 在RAG研究中采用大语言模型特定效用很有必要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为科学摘要生成多面嵌入，实现细粒度和可控的相似度评估以及自适应可视化。

Method: 采用无监督程序生成特定方面的总结句子，训练嵌入模型，将特定方面嵌入能力提炼到统一模型，引入嵌入解码管道。

Result: 该框架能有效进行多面嵌入生成，解码管道在低维可视化未占用区域也有效。

Conclusion: SemCSE - Multi框架可实现科学摘要多面嵌入，其解码管道提高了以用户为中心场景下的可解释性。

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理开放域问题时依赖固定动作序列，难以应对大规模信息检索，需要改进大语言模型在开放域多跳推理任务中的推理能力。

Method: 提出Feedback - Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP)框架，先识别关键实体作为初始节点，结合历史错误分析和实时反馈生成推理子节点，将深度优先搜索与创新节点生成技术结合。

Result: FGDIP在HotpotQA数据集上F1分数达54.47%，在StrategyQA数据集上达70.05%，分别比最佳基线高5.03%和7.25%。

Conclusion: FGDIP具有通用性，有潜力提升语言代理在多跳推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Method: 让大语言模型解释从算术序列到随机生成整数序列等各种整数序列的规律。

Result: 模型能识别算术和几何序列的正确规律，但在分析随机生成序列时频繁过度识别出与给定数字不一致的模式，多步推理模型也存在该问题。

Conclusion: 大语言模型感知不存在模式的倾向类似“种族假象”，表明其在需要逻辑推理的应用任务中存在潜在能力局限。

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

Motivation: RAG系统易受攻击，现有防御方法会造成信息损失和可靠性降低。

Method: 提出两阶段语义过滤和无冲突框架SeCon - RAG，第一阶段用EIRE进行联合过滤，第二阶段用EIRE引导冲突感知过滤。

Result: SeCon - RAG在保留有用知识同时减少冲突污染，在生成鲁棒性和输出可信度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: SeCon - RAG明显优于现有防御方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的知识图谱补全方法因预训练知识图谱模型的连续嵌入空间与大语言模型的离散标记空间不匹配，难以充分利用结构化语义表示，性能受限。

Method: 提出ReaLM框架，通过残差向量量化机制将预训练知识图谱嵌入离散化为紧凑代码序列并作为可学习标记集成到LLM词汇表中，还引入本体引导的类约束来保证语义一致性。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，ReaLM达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReaLM在将结构化知识与大规模语言模型对齐方面是有效的。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

Motivation: 随着AI应用增加，检测有害AI行为很重要，而攻击者和未对齐模型可能通过加密推理规避思维链监测，需评估此风险。

Method: 针对28种不同密码，微调并提示最多10个模型进行加密推理，以数学问题准确率衡量推理能力。

Result: 模型在加密文本推理时准确率显著下降，但能准确翻译加密文本；前沿模型在生僻密码推理上有困难，在常见密码如rot13上推理准确；加密推理能力与预训练数据中密码流行度相关，且随微调数据增加提升缓慢。

Conclusion: 利用加密推理规避思维链监测对当前模型可能是无效策略，并为约束未来前沿模型此能力发展提供指导。

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

Motivation: 现有方法在记忆更新方面存在缺陷，缺乏根据用户行为和上下文动态优化偏好记忆表示的机制。

Method: 提出偏好感知记忆更新机制PAMU，结合滑动窗口平均值（SW）和指数移动平均值（EMA）构建融合的偏好感知表示。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务场景实验中，该机制能显著提升五个基线中大语言模型的输出质量。

Conclusion: PAMU机制在长期对话中有效。

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

Conclusion: 相关性不足以评估法官，引入基于一致性模式的“法官图灵测试”，提供标准化基准对模型评判者进行分级。

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

Method: 在三个数据集上微调arLLMs和dLLMs，用前后向问答评估知识泛化和反转诅咒

Result: arLLMs依赖释义数据增强，且信息顺序要匹配；dLLMs无需释义即可在前后向问答获高精度，添加释义提升不大

Conclusion: 提出的掩码微调范式可提高arLLMs微调的数据效率，缩小与dLLMs的性能差距

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

Result: SHIELD在各数据集和指标上优于现有方法，在假新闻检测等任务上有通用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD框架能有效捕捉仇恨本质，提升仇恨表情包检测效果。

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

Conclusion: STRR能补充生育率指标，为设计更公平的多语言分词器提供实用指导。

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for

*Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang,Su Liu,Xin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨紧凑编码器在医疗摘要分类任务中的表现，发现DistilBERT加普通交叉熵效果佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型难用于有严格成本、延迟和隐私限制的医疗场景，研究紧凑编码器在可控预算下的能力。

Method: 使用公共医疗摘要语料库，固定分词器、序列长度等，用三种目标函数微调BERT base和DistilBERT。

Result: DistilBERT加普通交叉熵在测试集上实现最佳平衡，参数远少于BERT base，还报告了评估指标、发布代码并进行混淆分析。

Conclusion: 建议先使用紧凑编码器和交叉熵，再添加校准和特定任务检查，最后考虑更大模型。

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

TL;DR: 提出概念语言模型网络CLMN，兼顾性能与可解释性，在多数据集上表现优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在NLP可解释性有限，现有NLP概念瓶颈模型有缺陷，且少建模动态概念交互。

Method: 引入CLMN，将概念表示为连续、可读嵌入，用模糊逻辑推理学习自适应交互规则，增强文本特征并自动归纳规则。

Result: 在多数据集和预训练语言模型上，CLMN比现有基于概念方法准确率更高，解释质量更好。

Conclusion: 在统一概念空间集成神经表示与符号推理可产生实用、透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业文档处理中复制密集型文档信息提取这一关键但研究不足的挑战。

Method: 将OCR引擎与大语言模型结合，通过智能策略选择利用文档特定特征，实现25种配置并在三种提取范式上实验。

Result: 基于表的提取方法在结构化文档和图像输入上有高准确率和低延迟，比朴素方法性能提升54倍，能处理异构文档流。

Conclusion: 复制密集型任务的重复性可通过结构感知方法选择转化为优化机会。

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究大语言模型不公平性，提出DiffHeads去偏框架，降低模型不公平性且不损害效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作对大语言模型产生偏见输出的机制缺乏了解，现有缓解措施较脆弱。

Method: 比较DA和CoT提示方式，定义token - to - head贡献分数追溯注意力头，通过差异激活分析识别偏见头并选择性屏蔽。

Result: DA提示会触发模型自然偏见部分，提高不公平性；识别出在DA下激活而在CoT下休眠的偏见头；DiffHeads在DA和CoT下分别降低49.4%和40.3%的不公平性。

Conclusion: 提出的DiffHeads框架能有效减少大语言模型的不公平性，且不损害模型效用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多LLM系统计算成本高和推理延迟的问题。

Method: 在模型激活空间中提取并融合多个不同的角色向量，用融合向量引导推理时的生成过程。

Result: 在创造力基准测试中超越单模型提示和传统多LLM方法，大幅减少推理时间和计算成本。

Conclusion: 不同角色向量可融合以有效控制生成的互补方面，提高可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

Method: 围绕四个相互关联维度进行系统研究，包括模型视角的模型溯源和模型结构溯源，数据视角的训练数据溯源和外部数据溯源；提出双范式分类法对现有溯源方法分类。

Result: 完成对大语言模型内容溯源追踪的系统研究，构建分析维度和分类方法。

Conclusion: 跨维度的可追溯性能提升大语言模型在实际应用中部署的透明度、问责性和可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

TL;DR: 研究指出基于大语言模型的多智能体系统评估不应仅关注最终答案准确性，应重视推理过程，通过大规模研究分析了协作失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体系统评估仅关注最终答案准确性，忽略推理过程，在高风险医疗应用中有风险。

Method: 对六个医疗数据集的3600个案例和六个代表性多智能体框架进行大规模实证研究，采用定性分析与定量审计结合的混合方法。

Result: 发现四种主要失败模式：共享模型缺陷导致的错误共识、正确少数意见被压制、无效讨论动态和综合过程中的关键信息丢失。

Conclusion: 仅高准确性不足以建立临床或公众信任，医疗人工智能的开发和部署需要透明和可审计的推理过程。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域面临分布偏移，特定领域微调依赖高质量标签数据，收集成本高且慢。

Method: 提出SyTTA框架，结合输入侧困惑度和输出侧预测熵两个不确定性信号进行推理时自适应。

Result: 在多种模型架构和特定领域基准测试中，SyTTA有一致增益，如在农业问答上，Qwen - 2.5 - 7B的Rouge - LSum提升超120%。

Conclusion: 语言模型无需标签示例即可实现有效的测试时自适应，支持在标签稀缺领域部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 大语言模型推理易产生幻觉结论，先前工作未有效解决推理幻觉问题。

Method: 提出AoU框架，分三步将推理约束在有效前提上，形式上是后验约束推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MultiArith和SVAMP数据集上提升了准确性和忠实性，相比其他方法有显著增益。

Conclusion: AoU框架能有效解决大语言模型推理幻觉问题，提升推理效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

Conclusion: 研究为高级语言模型高效可扩展的测试时间推理策略设计提供新见解。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

Conclusion: 选择性拒答是可训练、对对齐敏感的能力，发布两个基准和生成框架以进行动态评估。

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

Method: 提出Steam语义级知识编辑框架，先确定目标表征为语义锚点，优化时通过对齐损失引导编辑事实内部表征向锚点靠近。

Result: Steam提升模型用编辑知识推理的能力，增强语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐对可靠连贯的知识编辑很重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

Method: 基于医生对300个真实患者问题的回答标注，对比粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级在正确性、相关性和安全性维度的评估。

Result: 不同维度的标注者间一致性（IAA）不同，细粒度标注提高正确性一致性，粗粒度提高相关性一致性，安全性判断不一致；小句子子集标注可提供与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: LongQAEval框架及小句子子集标注方法可用于资源有限和专业要求高的评估场景。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

Method: 提出LISTEN基准测试，对6个最先进的LALMs进行评估。

Result: 评估中发现模型存在一致的词汇主导现象，在不同线索条件下表现不佳，副语言场景中接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 当前LALMs主要是‘转录’而非‘倾听’，LISTEN为评估多模态模型的情感理解提供了框架。

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

Conclusion: 该系统能有效服务受正规教育有限的弱势群体。

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准评估自动机器学习研究代理时存在过度强调工程方面、忽视学术严谨性、任务多样性有限等问题，难以全面评估代理的科研能力。

Method: 引入FML - bench基准评估8个不同的基础机器学习研究问题，提出统一评估框架及五个互补指标。

Result: 评估发现采用广泛研究探索策略的代理优于专注狭窄深度探索的代理。

Conclusion: 强调探索广度可能比仅专注渐进式改进带来更有效的研究成果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark
is available at https://github.com/qrzou/FML-bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出无训练稀疏注意力机制DELTA，在推理任务中兼顾计算效率与模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在推理任务中因累积选择误差和标记动态重要性问题，存在严重精度下降，需一种新方法解决。

Method: 将Transformer层分为三组，初始层用全注意力，选择层通过聚合头级注意力分数识别显著标记，后续稀疏注意力层仅关注选定子集。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA - Diamond等推理基准上，DELTA精度与全注意力相当或更优，减少高达5倍关注标记数，实现1.5倍端到端加速。

Conclusion: 选择性复用中间注意力图是实现高效长上下文推理的可靠途径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

Motivation: 医疗医嘱提取对构建临床信息、支持决策和下游应用很重要，MEDIQA - OE 2025共享任务聚焦从对话转录本中提取结构化医嘱。

Method: 使用通用的、指令调优的LLaMA - 4 17B模型，无领域特定微调，以单个上下文示例引导。

Result: 在17个参赛团队的105份提交中排名第5，平均F1分数37.76，原因和出处准确性有显著提升。

Conclusion: 大型非特定领域大语言模型结合有效提示工程可作为专业临床NLP任务的强大、可扩展基线。

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Conclusion: HIPPD在人格检测方面表现出色，是一种有效的脑启发框架。

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在长上下文表现方面研究较少，旨在研究不从头训练扩展其上下文窗口的后训练技术。

Method: 对标准 RoPE 扩展进行简单修改以适应扩散过程的概率建模，比较后训练中的掩码策略。

Result: 引入的 UltraLLaDA 模型在长上下文任务上显著优于免训练基线。

Conclusion: 特殊的位置扩展是将扩散大语言模型扩展到更长上下文的关键，为从业者提供了通过高效后训练实现 128K 规模上下文的实用指导。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

Motivation: 文档摘要有主观性，个性化摘要训练数据稀缺，现有数据集存在不足，无法进行端到端监督学习且泛化性受限。

Method: 提出基于交叉轨迹洗牌和摘要内容扰动的数据增强技术PerAugy，选择两个SOTA摘要框架作为基线，引入三个数据集多样性指标。

Result: PerAugy显著提升四个SOTA用户编码器准确性，增强摘要框架个性化程度，TP和DegreeD与用户编码器性能强相关。

Conclusion: 增加数据集多样性是推动个性化摘要性能提升的关键因素。

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型因全精度骨干网络难在边缘设备部署，且记忆增强架构少与面向边缘的激进量化结合。

Method: 引入类似人类的外部情景记忆，使用1.58位编码器创建紧凑嵌入，解码器应用每层条件化和滑动窗口机制。

Result: 实现了质量与速度的良好平衡，在低延迟下以小模型规模实现有竞争力的字幕生成和多模态理解。

Conclusion: BitMar适合边缘部署。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于时态大语言模型的动态主题演化建模框架，实验表明其有效且优于现有模型，为理解大规模文本语义模式提供系统方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何有效捕捉大规模文本中动态语义模式，提升主题建模的连贯性、多样性、稳定性和可解释性的问题。

Method: 先用大语言模型获取文本上下文嵌入，引入时间衰减函数和注意力机制，将时间表示映射到潜在主题空间，用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化，通过联合优化目标约束语义建模和时间一致性。

Result: 在真实语料库实验中，该框架能有效捕捉主题的产生、扩展和衰退，在多个指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解大规模文本动态语义模式提供系统解决方案，丰富了主题建模研究范式，支持多领域复杂文本分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的整体架构在复杂推理和模式多样性方面存在困难。

Method: 提出AGENTIQL框架，包含推理代理、编码代理和细化步骤，还有自适应路由器，部分步骤可并行执行。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，使用14B模型采用Planner&Executor合并策略时执行准确率达86.07% EX。

Conclusion: AGENTIQL不仅提升了准确率，还增强了透明度，是一种强大、可扩展且可解释的语义解析方法。

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

TL;DR: 提出更具交互性的BrowserAgent，通过类人浏览器操作解决复杂任务，训练后在多任务中获有竞争力结果，可作为更高级框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究解决网络任务时依赖工具转换网页为静态文本，与人类浏览行为不同，需更具交互性的方式。

Method: 提出BrowserAgent，通过Playwright在原始网页上执行预定义浏览器操作，采用两阶段训练（SFT和RFT），引入显式记忆机制。

Result: 使用更少训练数据在不同Open - QA任务中取得有竞争力结果，BrowserAgent - 7B在多跳QA任务上比Search - R1提升约20%。

Conclusion: BrowserAgent可作为更高级、更具交互性和可扩展性的网络代理框架。

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Motivation: 现有缺乏有效整合方法以确保预测准确性和排名一致性的系统框架，有对不同模型能力综合评估基准测试套件压缩的需求。

Method: 先进行样本级基准冗余分析，将基准压缩构建为得分重构优化问题，提出利用迭代遗传算法的EssenceBench粗到细框架。

Result: 相比先前方法有更好压缩结果、更低重构误差和更高效率，如在HellaSwag基准测试上用更少样本保持模型排名。

Conclusion: 所提EssenceBench框架能有效进行基准测试压缩，在压缩效果和效率上表现优越。

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于使NLP系统更贴合不同用户需求、期望和实际体验。

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

Motivation: 大推理模型的长推理过程有计算和延迟开销，阻碍实际部署，需减轻过度思考。

Method: 将模型视为黑盒通信器，引入AdvPrompt迭代细化框架从不同视角生成高质量对抗提示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdvPrompt减少令牌使用并保持性能，如Qwen3系列在GSM8K问题上平均响应长度减3倍，四个基准测试平均减少约40%；Claude - 3.7和Gemini - 2.5在MATH - 500上分别减少35%和47%。

Conclusion: AdvPrompt在不同模型规模和家族有泛化性，黑盒提示是提升大推理模型效率的实用有效策略。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

Method: 进行三种音译（罗马化、音素转写和替代密码）和正字法的对照实验，在命名实体识别和自然语言推理两个下游任务上评估模型。

Result: 罗马化在8种评估设置中的7种显著优于其他输入类型。

Conclusion: 使用与预训练语言共享的较长（子词）标记能更好地利用模型，罗马化是最有效方法。

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to

Motivation: 以往AI系统评估主要关注问题解决，本文倡导评估AI系统对游戏的评估能力。

Method: 引入评估形式化方法，利用大规模数据集对比现代语言和推理模型与人类及符号计算代理的评估结果，考虑收益公平性和趣味性两种评估查询。

Result: 推理模型评估更接近人类，但接近博弈论最优时与人类数据契合度下降，评估趣味性时模型波动大，且推理模型资源使用不稳定。

Conclusion: 应在语言和推理模型中融入更多资源理性的元推理。

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出韩语毒性数据集KOTOX解决低资源语言毒性内容检测和去毒问题，支持去混淆和去毒，代码和数据公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注英语，低资源语言研究不足，大语言模型难以处理低资源语言毒性内容，用户使用混淆技术使问题更突出。

Method: 根据韩语语言特征对混淆方式分类，基于真实例子定义转换规则，构建三个不同混淆难度的数据集版本。

Result: 构建了首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒的数据集KOTOX。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于大语言模型更好理解和缓解低资源语言混淆毒性内容。

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

Result: 当前多模态大语言模型仍难以识别虚假前提，使用提出框架训练的模型在虚假前提识别上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 构建的基准和提出的框架有助于提升多模态大语言模型识别虚假前提的能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed

Motivation: 仇恨言论普遍存在且检测复杂，现有数据集特征多样，但以往研究方法固定，未适应数据特点。

Result: RV - HATE提高了检测准确性，能提供可解释见解，有效处理隐式仇恨言论。

Conclusion: RV - HATE方法能有效处理仇恨言论检测，性能优于传统静态方法。

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD能实现全面开放域评估和阶段感知防御，有效阻止有害内容传播，系统提升报告质量且不过度拒绝。

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

Motivation: 现有研究多以西方为中心，忽视全球南方残疾人在性别和种姓等交叉边缘化下的经历，要审视大语言模型在招聘领域对残疾人的歧视问题。

Method: 对六种大语言模型在2820个涵盖不同残疾、性别、国籍和种姓的招聘场景进行审计，引入ABLEIST伤害指标。

Result: 对残疾候选人的ABLEIST伤害显著增加，许多先进模型未检测到；性别和种姓边缘化的残疾候选人交叉伤害加剧。

Conclusion: 当前安全工具存在关键盲点，在招聘等高风险领域前沿模型需进行交叉安全评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

Motivation: 提升现成大语言模型的性能。

Method: 提出DND方法，在给定transformer层末尾用路由器识别关键token进行额外处理，通过控制损失和阈值控制策略精确控制动态选择机制，在预训练模型的后训练阶段集成该方法。

Result: 在不同基准测试中，使密集型Qwen3 - 1.7B性能提升1.88%，MoE Qwen3 - 30B - A3B性能提升0.87%，且参数和计算量增加极小。

Conclusion: DND方法能有效提升现成大语言模型的性能，且成本增加小。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Method: 引入Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR)任务，构建适合激活修补的最小对比对语料库。

Result: 约0.2%的稀疏电路能在基于英语PDTB的CuDR任务中恢复语篇理解，且能很好地泛化到未见的语篇框架。下层捕获词汇语义和共指等语言特征，上层编码语篇级抽象。

Conclusion: 确定了Transformer语言模型中负责语篇理解的稀疏电路，不同层在语篇理解中有不同作用，特征效用在不同框架中一致。

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

Motivation: 当前强化大语言模型推理方法存在训练偏差，依赖人类或高容量模型注释限制非人类推理路径探索，且观察到模型错误特征，需新方法解决问题。

Method: 提出Confidence - Guided Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO)方法，利用置信信号识别推理过程中最大不确定性点，应用自生成非人类推理路径引导以减少轨迹漂移。

Result: 在代码和数学推理任务的实验中，相同训练数据量下，小模型生成数据的方法多数情况下比强模型生成数据或人工注释方法性能更好。

Conclusion: CGPO方法有效，小模型生成数据的该方法具有优势。

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

Result: R3显著降低训练 - 推理策略的KL散度，缓解极端差异，不影响训练速度，能稳定强化学习训练，防止崩溃，效果优于GSPO和TIS等方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为MoE模型中的强化学习稳定提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Motivation: 基于距离的无监督文本分类有优势，但多标签分类需阈值判断，该领域研究不足，故深入研究句子编码器性能。

Method: 在多样的多标签文本分类数据集上实验，验证文本与标签语义关系的变化；提出用验证集优化标签特定阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的标签特定阈值优化方法有效，在多标签文本分类中表现出色。

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

Conclusion: RAGen框架具有可扩展性和模块化特点，适合动态发展领域。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

Result: 发现答案存在系统性不一致、位置依赖的准确率损失和动量效应，基于机制相似性的指标能以高达78%的准确率预测答案一致性。

Conclusion: 事实一致性是大语言模型可信度的重要方面，挑战了当前假设简单查询表现好则复杂任务也可靠的评估实践。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Conclusion: MFC可作为面向诊断的补充指标，用于道德推理模型的公平性评估，实现跨异构语言环境的可靠部署。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

Motivation: 测试Transformer语言模型注意力机制中各关键设计原则的必要性。

Method: 设计受控变体，选择性放宽原则，在所有层统一应用或采用混合架构。

Result: 混合令牌机制不可或缺，数学形式和序列依赖性可大幅放宽，不同变体间存在协同效应。

Conclusion: 加深对注意力机制有效性基础的理解，为简化语言模型开辟新途径。

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

Method: 将自动事实核查这一现有NLP任务重新用作AI代理的认知自卫工具。

Result: 指出内容攻击现象，现有防御方法对其无效。

Conclusion: AI代理应通过自动事实核查来批判性评估检索信息，增强防御能力。

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

Result: EASE在多个基准上达到了最先进的性能，显著提高了对实时新闻的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EASE框架有效解决了实时场景下证据不足时的假新闻检测问题，具有良好性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统“冻结世界”假设在现代推理任务中不适用，需要在动态场景下评估LRMs的鲁棒性。

Method: 在中断和动态上下文两种现实动态场景下评估LRMs的鲁棒性，涵盖数学和编程基准测试。

Result: 静态评估始终高估了LRMs的鲁棒性，即使是最先进的模型在动态场景下也可能不可预测地失败，性能最多下降60%。

Conclusion: 揭示了推理泄漏、恐慌和自我怀疑等多种新的失败模式。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

Result: 在自定义BabyAI - XGen环境的具身视觉语言任务中，智能体的组合泛化能力和鲁棒性显著提高。

Conclusion: 语言反馈是语言指定具身任务中替代中间标量奖励的有竞争力且直观的选择。

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

Conclusion: 这是首个揭示和验证大语言模型中情感电路的系统研究，为可解释性和可控情商提供新见解。

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

Result: 记忆在最初几个epoch大幅增加，早停标准能减少记忆且性能损失小，正则化器最多减少40%记忆且性能权衡小。

Conclusion: 为语言模型微调时的记忆动态提供实用、可扩展的见解。

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: KnowRL解锁大模型自知能力提升潜力，有望实现可靠、负责AI，鼓励用于未来模型

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

Result: AdaKD作为即插即用框架，能在多种模型架构和基准测试中持续提升各种蒸馏方法的性能。

Conclusion: AdaKD能有效解决现有知识蒸馏方法的局限，提升蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

Conclusion: 增强采样用于力匹配是提高CG MLPs准确性和可靠性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger
systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic
models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture
many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of
mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a
bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations
sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure
thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first,
sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and
second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To
address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of
freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the
unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time
required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition
regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable
improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force
matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG
MLPs.

a time-to-event outcome: Status \& Intensity observations from the USA-NPN are
converted to interval bounds, linked to NASA POWER daily weather, and analyzed
with parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models (Weibull and
log-logistic). To avoid outcome-dependent bias from aggregating weather up to
the event date, antecedent conditions are summarized in fixed pre-season
windows and standardized; quality-control filters ensure adequate within-window
data coverage. Applied to flowering and ripening of \textit{V.~vinifera}, the
framework yields interpretable time-ratio effects and publication-ready tables
and figures. Warmer pre-season conditions are associated with earlier ripening,
whereas flowering responses are modest and uncertain in these data;
precipitation plays, at most, a secondary role. The approach demonstrates how
interval-censored survival models with exogenous weather windows can extract
robust climate signals from citizen-science phenology while preserving
observation uncertainty, and it generalizes readily to other species and
networks.

Abstract: The lack of standardization in seizure forecasting slows progress in the
field and limits the clinical translation of forecasting models. In this work,
we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development,
assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms.
  The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast
post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various
forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation
details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three
different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged
features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model
performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key
deterministic and probabilistic metrics.
  Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the
flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of
careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling,
calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability
metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development
time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that
could affect the comparability of different approaches.
  As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a
single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across
independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework
publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation,
and gather feedback. In the long term, we aim to contribute to the
establishment of a consensus on a standardized methodology for the development
and validation of seizure forecasting algorithms in people with epilepsy.
