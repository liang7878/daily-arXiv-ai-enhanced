A key challenge is that a user's search query often leaves their true intent ambiguous. Typically, platforms passively predict relevance based on available signals and in some cases offer query refinements. The shift from traditional search to conversational AI provides a new approach. When a user's query is ambiguous, a Large Language Model (LLM) can proactively offer several clarifying follow-up prompts. In this paper we consider the following: what if some of these follow-up prompts can be ``sponsored,'' i.e., selected for their advertising potential. How should these ``suggestion slots'' be allocated? And, how does this new mechanism interact with the traditional ad auction that might follow?\n  This paper introduces a formal model for designing and analyzing these interactive platforms. We use this model to investigate a critical engineering choice: whether it is better to build an end-to-end pipeline that jointly optimizes the user interaction and the final ad auction, or to decouple them into separate mechanisms for the suggestion slots and another for the subsequent ad slot. We show that the VCG mechanism can be adopted to jointly optimize the sponsored suggestion and the ads that follow; while this mechanism is more complex, it achieves outcomes that are efficient and truthful. On the other hand, we prove that the simple-to-implement modular approach suffers from strategic inefficiency: its Price of Anarchy is unbounded.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u53f0\u5e7f\u544a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u4e0b\u8d5e\u52a9\u8ddf\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5206\u914d\u53ca\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u4e0b\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u610f\u56fe\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u88ab\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8d5e\u52a9\u8ddf\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u914d\u53ca\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "VCG\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8d5e\u52a9\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u4f46\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\uff1b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ef7\u683c\u65e0\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684VCG\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Such insider threats can severely undermine cooperative systems: subtle deviations may degrade collective performance, jeopardize mission success, and compromise operational safety. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating insider threats in cooperative control settings. We introduce an insider-aware, game-theoretic formulation in which the insider's hidden intention is parameterized, allowing the threat identification task to be reformulated as a parameter estimation problem. To address this challenge, we employ an online indirect dual adaptive control approach that simultaneously infers the insider's control strategy and counteracts its negative influence. By injecting properly designed probing signals, the resulting mitigation policy asymptotically recovers the nominal optimal control law - one that would be achieved under full knowledge of the insider's objective. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification-mitigation framework and illustrate its capability to preserve team performance even in the presence of covert adversarial behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5185\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u95f4\u63a5\u53cc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u90e8\u4eba\u5458\u5a01\u80c1\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u7834\u574f\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u96c6\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8003\u8651\u5185\u90e8\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5a01\u80c1\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u95f4\u63a5\u53cc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u63a2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e94\u5bf9\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u8bc6\u522b - \u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u853d\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u961f\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In this paper, we prove that OCP is NP-complete through a polynomial-time reduction from the strongly NP-complete 3-Partition problem. Our reduction constructs a tight budget that forces optimal solutions to correspond exactly to valid 3-partitions.

Existing RAG approaches often focus on general documents, and they overlook the fact that many real-world documents (such as books, booklets, handbooks, etc.) have a hierarchical structure, which organizes their content from different granularity levels, leading to poor performance for the QA task. To address these limitations, we introduce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information. Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intricate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval workflow.

Existing autoscaling policies, often retrofitted from monolithic systems like those in AIBrix and DistServe, rely on lagging indicators such as GPU utilization or coarse-grained request counts. This results in slow reactions to load spikes, leading to significant Time-to First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) SLO violations and costly over-provisioning. We introduce TokenScale, an autoscaling framework that resolves this performance mismatch through two innovations. First, we propose Token Velocity, a novel metric that unifies the prefill, network, and decode stages by quantifying their rate of work. As a leading indicator of system backpressure, it enables proactive scaling. Second, Convertible Decoders allow decoder GPUs to dynamically execute prefill tasks during traffic spikes, creating a rapid-response buffer that absorbs bursts and eliminates the initialization latency of new prefillers. Our evaluation on a GPU cluster with production traces shows TokenScale improves SLO attainment from 50-88% to 80-96% and reduces costs by 4-14% over state-of-the-art systems, including DistServe, BlitzScale, and AIBrix.

Despite these benefits, SNNs still face challenges in achieving state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. Recent work has shown that hybrid rate-temporal coding strategies (particularly those incorporating bit-plane representations of images into traditional rate coding schemes) can significantly improve performance when trained with surrogate backpropagation. Motivated by these findings, this study proposes a hybrid temporal-bit spike coding method that integrates bit-plane decompositions with temporal coding principles. Through extensive experiments across multiple computer vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that blending bit-plane information with temporal coding yields competitive, and in some cases improved, performance compared to established spike-coding techniques.

We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50).

Traditionally, DFMs have been published with conceptual block diagrams, promoting clarity and reproducibility in simulation.

This letter presents a block diagram representation of the Generalized Maxwell Slip (GMS) friction model, an advanced multi-state DFM capable of simulating a wide range of nonlinear friction phenomena. The diagram can be implemented in the MATLAB-Simulink environment using a Stateflow chart or embedded if-else logic to represent the state transition criteria, but it is not limited to this platform. Closed-loop and open-loop simulations were conducted to verify that the block diagram reproduces non-drifting behavior and stick-slip friction, including benchmarking against the LuGre model.

A trading cycle is treated as a non-equilibrium thermodynamic process, where price impact represents dissipative work and market noise plays the role of thermal fluctuations. The paper proves a Financial Second Law: under general convex impact functionals, any round-trip trading strategy yields non-positive expected profit. This structural constraint is complemented by a fluctuation theorem that bounds the probability of profitable cycles in terms of dissipated work and market volatility. The framework introduces a statistical ensemble of trading strategies governed by a Gibbs measure, leading to a free energy decomposition that connects expected cost, strategy entropy, and a market temperature parameter. The framework provides rigorous, testable inequalities linking microstructural impact to macroscopic no-arbitrage conditions, offering a novel physics-inspired perspective on market efficiency.

A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 \u00b0C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 \u00b0C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c1\u89e3\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u94a2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8fde\u7eed\u51b7\u5374\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08CCT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u6750\u6599\uff08\u5982\u94a2\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\u3001\u52a0\u5de5\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c1\u89e3\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8fde\u7eed\u51b7\u5374\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08CCT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u57284100\u4e2a\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u80fd\u57285\u79d2\u5185\u751f\u6210\u542b100\u6761\u51b7\u5374\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574CCT\u56fe\uff1b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u5404\u76f8\u7684\u76f8\u5206\u7c7bF1\u5206\u6570\u8d8588%\uff1b\u76f8\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u9664\u8d1d\u6c0f\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a27\u00b0C\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u4f4e\u4e8e20\u00b0C\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7528\u4e8e\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we study two LLM-centric optimizations, tuple batching and operator fusion, to significantly improve efficiency while managing accuracy loss.\n  Because these optimizations inherently trade accuracy for speed, we present a dynamic optimization framework that uses lightweight shadow executions and cost-aware multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to learn throughput-accuracy frontiers and adapt plans under probing budgets.\n  We implement CPs in the VectraFlow stream processing system. Using operator-level microbenchmarks and streaming pipelines on real datasets, we show that VectraFlow can adapt to workload dynamics, navigate accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and sustain persistent semantic queries over evolving unstructured streams.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faContinuous Prompts (CPs)\u6846\u67b6\u5c06LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5728VectraFlow\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u5355\u6b21\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6d41\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCPs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55RAG\u5230\u6d41\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u4e49\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728VectraFlow\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0CPs\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u6301\u4e45\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "CPs\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Traditional recommendation systems often lack explainability and suffer from issues such as popularity bias. Previous research has also indicated that LLMs, when used as standalone predictors, fail to achieve accuracy comparable to traditional models. To address these challenges, we propose to use LLM as an explainable re-ranker, a hybrid approach that combines traditional recommendation models with LLMs to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We constructed a dataset to train the re-ranker LLM and evaluated the alignment between the generated dataset and human expectations. Leveraging a two-stage training process, our model significantly improved NDCG, a key ranking metric. Moreover, the re-ranker outperformed a zero-shot baseline in ranking accuracy and interpretability.

Leveraging the differentiable nature of hybrid models, researchers have explored their potential to address complex problems through unified optimization strategies. One such development is the Spiking Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), which combines principles from spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantum computing. However, existing SQNN implementations often depend on pretrained SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of spiking activity and the limited scalability of current SNN encoders. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, Spiking-Quantum Data Re-upload Convolutional Neural Network (SQDR-CNN), that enables joint training of convolutional SNNs and quantum circuits within a single backpropagation framework. Unlike its predecessor, SQDR-CNN allow convergence to reasonable performance without the reliance of pretrained spiking encoder and subsetting datasets. We also clarified some theoretical foundations, testing new design using quantum data-reupload with different training algorithm-initialization and evaluate the performance of the proposed model under noisy simulated quantum environments. As a result, we were able to achieve 86% of the mean top-performing accuracy of the SOTA SNN baselines, yet uses only 0.5% of the smallest spiking model's parameters.

Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cdLLM\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u624b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u968f\u96be\u5ea6\u964d\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u624b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0cLLM\u6709\u671b\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7528Codeflaws\u3001Condefects\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684BugT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f306\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c7\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u4e14\u5c11\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff1b\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1bLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u7528\u3002"}}

Experiments show that models based on tree sets (Random Forest and XGBoost) achieve the best performance, with accuracies approaching 99%, significantly outperforming logistic regression and individual decision trees. The ability of each model to detect each attack category is also analyzed, highlighting the challenges in identifying rare attacks (R2L and U2R).

It analyzes the impacts of agriculture, industry, construction and services sectors on unemployment using annual data for the period 2000-2022. ARDL method is applied within the scope of the analysis. The findings are tested with FMOLS and CCR methods. The results show that growth in all sectors reduces the unemployment. A one-unit increase in the share of agriculture sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 0.471 points, 0.680 points in the industrial sector, 0.899 points in the construction sector and 1.383 points in the services sector in the short-run. The long-run coefficients reveal that the impacts of sectoral growth on unemployment are stronger in the long-run than in the short-run. A one unit increase in the share of the agricultural sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 2.380 points, 4.057 points in the industrial sector, 1.761 points in the construction sector and 3.664 points in the services sector in the long-run.

A key component of LLM alignment is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where humans compare pairs of model-generated answers and their preferences are used to train a reward model. However, human feedback is inherently heterogeneous, creating significant challenges for reliable reward learning. To address this, we adopt a heterogeneous preference framework that jointly models the latent reward of answers and human rationality. This leads to a challenging biconvex optimization problem, which we solve via an alternating gradient descent algorithm. We establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting estimator, including its convergence and asymptotic distribution. These results enable the construction of confidence intervals for reward estimates. Leveraging these uncertainty quantification results, we conduct valid statistical comparisons between rewards and incorporate uncertainty into the best-of-$N$ (BoN) policy framework.

We show that the optimization problem reduces to a quadratic program (QP) once the signs of the nonzero coefficients are specified. In this case, the compatibility constant can be obtained by solving QPs for all possible sign combinations. We also formulate a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) approach that can be applied when the number of true nonzero coefficients is moderately large.

If n datasets must serve m environments, up to n*m replicas can emerge, increasing inconsistency and cost. Traditional warehouses copy data into vendor-specific stores; cross-platform access is hard. This study proposes the Enterprise Data Science Platform (EDSP), which builds on data lakehouse architecture and follows a Write-Once, Read-Anywhere principle. EDSP enables federated data access for multi-query engine environments, targeting data science workloads with periodic data updates and query response times ranging from seconds to minutes. By providing centralized data management with federated access from multiple query engines to the same data sources, EDSP eliminates data duplication and vendor lock-in inherent in traditional data warehouses. The platform employs a four-layer architecture: Data Preparation, Data Store, Access Interface, and Query Engines. This design enforces separation of concerns and reduces the need for data migration when integrating additional analytical environments. Experimental results demonstrate that major cloud data warehouses and programming environments can directly query EDSP-managed datasets. We implemented and deployed EDSP in production, confirming interoperability across multiple query engines. For data sharing across different analytical environments, EDSP achieves a 33-44% reduction in operational steps compared with conventional approaches requiring data migration. Although query latency may increase by up to a factor of 2.6 compared with native tables, end-to-end completion times remain on the order of seconds, maintaining practical performance for analytical use cases.

Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations.

A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.

While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x.

Such optimization becomes unfeasible when it is focused on a global search requiring thousands of simulations to be evaluated. Here, we present a viable global shape optimization methodology based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms accelerated by deep neural networks (DNNs). Our methodology alternates between evaluating simulations and utilizing the generated data to train DNNs with various architectures. When a suitable DNN architecture is identified, the DNN replaces the simulation in the rest of the global search. Our methodology was tested on five ZDT benchmark functions, showing itself at the level of and sometimes more flexible than other state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Then, it was applied to a real-life optimization problem, namely the shape optimization of a single-phase ejector. Compared with a non-accelerated methodology, ours was able to save weeks of CPU time in solving this problem. To experimentally confirm the performance of the optimized ejector shapes, four of them were 3D printed and tested on the lab scale confirming the predicted performance.

We employ profiling tools such as gprof, perf, IPM and Darshan, which provide insights into computation, communication, and I/O operations. We implement time-dependent data checkpointing with the openPMD API enabling seamless data movement and in-situ visualization for real-time analysis without interrupting the simulation. We demonstrate improvements in simulation runtime, data accessibility and real-time insights by comparing traditional file I/O with the ADIOS2 BP4 and SST backends.

However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements.

This motivates methods that integrate labelled and unlabelled data within a learning framework. Most SSL approaches assume that label absence is harmless, typically treated as missing completely at random or ignored, but in practice, the missingness process can be informative, as the chances of an observation being unlabelled may depend on the ambiguity of its feature vector. In such cases, the missingness indicators themselves provide additional information that, if properly modelled, may improve estimation efficiency. The \\textbf{SSLfmm} package for R is designed to capture this behaviour by estimating the Bayes' classifier under a finite mixture model in which each component corresponding to a class follows a multivariate normal distribution. It incorporates a mixed-missingness mechanism that combines a missing completely at random (MCR) component with a (non-ignorable) missing at random (MAR) component, the latter modelling the probability of label missingness as a logistic function of the entropy based on the features. Parameters are estimated via an Expectation--Conditional Maximisation algorithm. In the two-class Gaussian setting with arbitrary covariance matrices, the resulting classifier trained on partially labelled data may, in some cases, achieve a lower misclassification rate than the supervised version in the case where all the labels are known. The package includes a practical tool for modelling and illustrates its performance through simulated examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdR\u8bed\u8a00\u7684SSLfmm\u5305\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6807\u7b7e\u7f3a\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7387\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6807\u7b7e\u7f3a\u5931\u65e0\u5bb3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7f3a\u5931\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MCAR\u548cMAR\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7f3a\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u671f\u671b - \u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u9ad8\u65af\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e14\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u4efb\u610f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "SSLfmm\u5305\u4e3a\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs.

We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets.

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task.

With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists.

It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPINS - CAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9ad8\u9700\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u67093D\u91cd\u5efa\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684CFD\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u751f\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPINS - CAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u752820\u4e07\u5408\u6210\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u54081D Navier - Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u538b\u964d\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "PINS - CAD\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6AUC\u8fbe0.73\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0cPINS - CAD\u5c06\u5e38\u89c4\u8840\u7ba1\u9020\u5f71\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u751f\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u9632\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u5b66\u3002"}}

Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea0\u6b63\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5371\u9669\u6c14\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u5e76\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e38\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u6216\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u4e3e\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6709S - PSI\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u6270\u52a8\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u6269\u6563\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u7528Metropolis - Hastings\u68c0\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5371\u9669\u6c14\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u6b63\u786e\u65f6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178SMC\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5DEPF\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3S - PSI\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002"}}

A dataset was compiled using graph instances from TWITTER, COLLAB and IMDB-BINARY benchmarks commonly used in graph machine learning research. A set of 33 generic and 2 problem-specific polynomial-time-computable graph-based features, including several spectral properties, was employed for the ISA. A composite performance mea- sure incorporating both solution quality and algorithm runtime was utilized.

Despite the prevalence of this behavior, a significant disconnect persists between mainstream e-commerce search engines and users' comparison needs. Traditional ranking models often evaluate items in isolation, disregarding the context in which users compare multiple items on a search results page. While recent advances in deep learning have sought to improve ranking accuracy, diversity, and fairness by encoding listwise context, the challenge of aligning search rankings with user comparison shopping behavior remains inadequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking architecture - Learning-to-Comparison-Shop (LTCS) System - that explicitly models and learns users' comparison shopping behaviors. Through extensive offline and online experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant gains in key business metrics - improving NDCG by 1.7% and boosting booking conversion rate by 0.6% in A/B testing - while also enhancing user experience. We also compare our model against state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate that LTCS significantly outperforms them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLearning - to - Comparison - Shop (LTCS)\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u5546\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d2d\u7269\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u7535\u5546\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d2d\u7269\u9700\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6392\u540d\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u7528\u6237\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u641c\u7d22\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLearning - to - Comparison - Shop (LTCS)\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cNDCG\u63d0\u9ad81.7%\uff0cA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9884\u8ba2\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u63d0\u9ad80.6%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LTCS\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u641c\u7d22\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u7528Concordia\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u5408\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u793e\u4ea4\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u65b0\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Concordia\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f19\u4f34\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5171\u540c\u83b7\u5229\u673a\u4f1a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u5408\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8bf4\u670d\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u6267\u884c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u5408\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

However, adapting molecular information to the serialized, token-based processing of LLMs remains a key challenge. Compared to other representations, molecular graphs explicitly encode atomic connectivity and local topological environments, which are key determinants of atomic behavior and molecular properties. Despite recent efforts to tokenize overall molecular topology, there still lacks effective fine-grained tokenization of local atomic environments, which are critical for determining sophisticated chemical properties and reactivity. To address these issues, we introduce AtomDisc, a novel framework that quantizes atom-level local environments into structure-aware tokens embedded directly in LLM's token space. Our experiments show that AtomDisc, in a data-driven way, can distinguish chemically meaningful structural features that reveal structure-property associations. Equipping LLMs with AtomDisc tokens injects an interpretable inductive bias that delivers state-of-the-art performance on property prediction and molecular generation.

However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis.

Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u5bf9\u6c11\u4e3b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7cbe\u82f1\u5851\u9020\u516c\u4f17\u653f\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u6781\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7cbe\u82f1\u9700\u83b7\u5927\u4f17\u652f\u6301\u6765\u6cbb\u7406\uff0cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u5851\u9020\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6781\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e00\u7cbe\u82f1\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7acb\u7cbe\u82f1\u5728\u6743\u529b\u4ea4\u66ff\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u8bf4\u670d\u6210\u672c\u548c\u591a\u6570\u89c4\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u653f\u7b56\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e00\u7cbe\u82f1\u5e72\u9884\u4f1a\u4f7f\u793e\u4f1a\u8d70\u5411\u66f4\u6781\u5316\uff1b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7acb\u7cbe\u82f1\u65f6\uff0c\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6216\u6291\u5236\u6781\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u6781\u5316\u6210\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u968f\u7740AI\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bf9\u6c11\u4e3b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol.

This allows us to study their properties by sampling the most probable states of those systems. However, the sampling capabilities of these methods are not sufficiently accurate when handling complex configuration spaces. This has resulted in the development of new techniques that improve sampling accuracy, usually at the expense of increasing the computational cost. One of such techniques is Parallel Tempering which improves accuracy by running several replicas which periodically exchange their states. Computationally, this imposes a significant slow-down, which can be counteracted by means of parallelization. These schemes enable MCMC/PT techniques to be run more effectively and allow larger models to be studied. In this work, we present a parallel implementation of Metropolis-Hastings with Parallel Tempering, using OpenMP and CUDA for the parallelization in modern CPUs and GPUs, respectively. The results show a maximum speed-up of 52x using OpenMP with 48 cores, and of 986x speed-up with the CUDA version.

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL.

Efficient stack management remains a significant challenge for effect handlers due to the dynamic control flow changes they introduce. This paper explores a novel stack management approach using user-level overcommitting within the libseff C library, which leverages virtual memory mechanisms and protection-based lazy allocation combined with signal-driven memory commitment. Our user-level overcommitting implementation dynamically resizes stacks on-demand, improving memory utilization and reducing waste compared to traditional methods. We rigorously benchmark and evaluate this novel strategy against conventional fixed- size stacks, segmented stacks, and kernel-based overcommitting, using metrics such as context-switch latency, stack expansion efficiency, multi-threaded performance, and robustness under rapid stack growth conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that kernel-based overcommitting achieves an effective balance between performance and flexibility, whereas our user-level implementation, while flexible, incurs additional overheads, highlighting areas for optimization.

This enables early detection of deviations and supports timely control actions to ensure optimal cell growth and product quality. BPM plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and regulatory compliance of biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. However, the development of accurate soft sensors for BPM is hindered by key challenges, including limited historical data, infrequent feedback, heterogeneous process conditions, and high-dimensional sensory inputs. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of machine learning (ML) methods designed to address these challenges, with a focus on learning from historical data with limited volume and relevance in the context of bioprocess monitoring. We evaluate multiple ML approaches including feature dimensionality reduction, online learning, and just-in-time learning across three datasets, one in silico dataset and two real-world experimental datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of training strategies in handling limited data and feedback, with batch learning proving effective in homogeneous settings, while just-in-time learning and online learning demonstrate superior adaptability in cold-start scenarios. Additionally, we identify key meta-features, such as feed media composition and process control strategies, that significantly impact model transferability. The results also suggest that integrating Raman-based predictions with lagged offline measurements enhances monitoring accuracy, offering a promising direction for future bioprocess soft sensor development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u66fc\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6ede\u540e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u6279\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08BPM\uff09\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8f6f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u9762\u4e34\u6709\u9650\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u9891\u7e41\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u964d\u7ef4\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u540c\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5373\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\uff1b\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u66fc\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6ede\u540e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u66fc\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6ede\u540e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f6f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To this end, we analyze the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the pre-trained model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. Specifically, we characterize when tokens move closer to or farther from one another over time, depending on the model parameters. We provide sufficient conditions, based on these parameters, to identify scenarios where tokens either converge to zero or diverge to infinity. Unlike prior works, our conditions are broader in scope and more applicable to real-world models. Furthermore, we investigate how different forms of positional encoding -- specifically absolute and rotary -- affect these dynamical regimes. Empirical evidence reveals that the convergence scenario adversely impacts model performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose simple refinements to Transformer architectures that mitigate convergence behavior in models with absolute or rotary positional encoding. These findings support theoretical foundations and design principles for improving Transformer models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dtoken\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdbTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dtoken\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u89e3\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6536\u655b\u60c5\u51b5\u4f1a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdbTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

The collected data covers more than 55% of the DeFi market cap and is obtained exclusively by protocol executives, board members, or delegates.

In this setting, each vertex corresponds to a geometric object, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their objects intersect. We introduce a new tool for designing such algorithms, which we call a $\u03bb$-linked partition. This is a partition of the vertex set into groups of highly connected vertices. Crucially, such a partition can be computed in polynomial time and does not require access to the geometric representation of the graph. We apply this framework to problems related to paths and cycles in graphs. First, we obtain the first robust ETH-tight algorithms for Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle, running in time $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This resolves an open problem of de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] and completes the study of these problems on geometric intersection graphs from the viewpoint of ETH-tight exact algorithms. We further extend our approach to the parameterized setting and design the first robust subexponential parameterized algorithm for Long Path in any fixed dimension $d$. More precisely, we obtain a randomized robust algorithm running in time $2^{O(k^{1-1/d}\\log^2 k)}\\, n^{O(1)}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $k$ is the natural parameter. Besides $\u03bb$-linked partitions, our algorithm also relies on a low-treewidth pattern covering theorem that we establish for geometric intersection graphs, which may be viewed as a refinement of a result of Marx-Pilipczuk [ESA 2017].

Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory.

However, optimizing EB charging schedules to minimize operational costs while ensuring safe operation without battery depletion remains challenging - especially under real-world conditions, where uncertainties in PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, variable travel times, and limited charging infrastructure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options to enable temporally abstract decision-making. We develop a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian), which integrates Lagrangian relaxation into the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) framework. At the high level, we adopt a centralized PPO-Lagrangian algorithm to learn safe charger allocation policies. At the low level, we incorporate MAPPO-Lagrangian to learn decentralized charging power decisions under the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm.

Instead of listing all cliques, we identify a small collection of clusters with edge density at least $\u03c1$ that collectively contain every maximal clique.\n  In contrast to maximal clique enumeration, we prove that for all $\u03c1< 1$, every graph admits a $\u03c1$-dense aggregator of \\emph{sub-exponential} size, $n^{O(\\log_{1/\u03c1}n)}$, and provide an algorithm achieving this bound.

This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation.

However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \\textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation.\n  To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\\% for C and 81\\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\\%.

Constraining the optimization to the ground-truth crystal family significantly improves recovery, yielding higher match rates and increased mutual information and correlation scores between structural similarity and XRD similarity.

Such systems often display sensitive dependence on initial conditions, reflected in positive Lyapunov exponents, where even small perturbations in short-term forecasts can lead to large deviations in long-term outcomes. Thus, meaningful inference requires not only accurate short-term predictions, but also consistency with the system's long-term attractor that is captured by the marginal distribution of state variables. Existing approaches attempt to address this challenge by incorporating spatial and temporal dependence, but these strategies become impractical when data are extremely sparse. In this work, we show that prior knowledge of marginal distributions offers valuable complementary information to short-term observations, motivating a distribution-informed learning framework. We introduce a calibration algorithm based on normalization and the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to enhance ML predictions. The method here employs KSD within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to calibrate model outputs, improving their fidelity to known physical distributions.

This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRP - ReAct\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RP - ReAct\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5305\u542bRPA\u548cPEA\uff0cPEA\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728ToolQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRP - ReAct\u5728\u5404\u8bc4\u4f30\u9886\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RP - ReAct\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Rather than enumerating candidate trees or relying on heuristic impurity or entropy measures, we encode the entire space of bounded-depth decision trees symbolically in SAT formulas. We propose a symbolic method for active learning of decision trees, in which approximate model counting is used to estimate the reduction of the hypothesis space caused by each potential query, enabling near-optimal query selection without full model enumeration. The resulting learner incrementally strengthens a CNF representation based on observed query outcomes, and approximate model counter ApproxMC is invoked to quantify the remaining version space in a sound and scalable manner. Additionally, when ApproxMC stagnates, a functional equivalence check is performed to verify that all remaining hypotheses are functionally identical.

To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens. Together, e-valuator provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that converts verifier heuristics into decisions rules with statistical guarantees, enabling the deployment of more reliable agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fae-valuator\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9ed1\u76d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5206\u6570\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u865a\u8b66\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u53ef\u7ec8\u6b62\u95ee\u9898\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u8282\u7701\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5206\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u4ee3\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u6210\u529f\u65e0\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u533a\u5206\u6210\u529f\u548c\u4e0d\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8ee-processes\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0a\uff0ce-valuator\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u865a\u8b66\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u7ec8\u6b62\u95ee\u9898\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u8282\u7701\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "conclusion": "e-valuator\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Such gates have been explored to possibly yield more efficient computations via reduced circuit depth, and can be carried out efficiently in some types of quantum hardware (e.g., trapped-ion quantum computers); we consider this as an exploration of an ``extreme'' case for distribution given the global qubit-qubit interactions.

Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.\n  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints.

First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR)\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3Shapley\u503c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Shapley\u503c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u4e2d\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\u5047\u8bbe\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u52a0\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e38\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u91ca\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SISR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9Shapley\u5411\u91cf\u5b9e\u65bdL0\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528Pool - Adjacent - Violators\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u786c\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "SISR\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u652f\u6301\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "SISR\u7edf\u4e00\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8ffd\u6c42\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u517c\u5177\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

These events occurred at most once in the dataset making the challenge fundamentally one of extrapolating extreme values. Given the scarcity of extreme events, we argue that a simple, robust modeling approach is essential. We adopt univariate models instead of multivariate ones and model Peaks Over Thresholds using Extreme Value Theory.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios.

However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance.

However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \\emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization.\n  In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing. We hope that work will result in increased adoption of DP synthetic data, spur additional research and increase trust in DP synthetic data approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5217\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u91ca\u653e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5168\u5957\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5217\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e0c\u671b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.\n  The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.\n  We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score.

In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u503e\u659c\uff08\u71b5\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u503e\u659c\u98ce\u9669\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6574\u6d41FM\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6574\u6d41FM\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u5ffd\u7565\u9ad8\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\uff08\u5bf9\u6570 - \u6307\u6570\uff09\u53d8\u6362\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6FM\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5FM\u76ee\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\u3002", "result": "\u503e\u659c\u98ce\u9669\u635f\u5931\u662f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5FM\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u6062\u590d\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u503e\u659c\uff08\u71b5\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eFM\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6574\u6d41FM\u3002"}}

While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement.

Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) has emerged as a powerful universality principle in this context: it states that the behavior of high-dimensional, complex features can be captured by Gaussian surrogates, which are more amenable to analysis. Despite its remarkable successes, numerical experiments show that this equivalence can fail even for simple embeddings -- such as polynomial maps -- under general scaling regimes.\n  We investigate this breakdown in the setting of random feature (RF) models in the quadratic scaling regime, where both the number of features and the sample size grow quadratically with the data dimension. We show that when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the data, such as generalized linear models, GET yields incorrect predictions. To capture the correct asymptotics, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which can be viewed as appending a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component to an otherwise high-dimensional Gaussian model. This hybrid model retains the tractability of the Gaussian framework and accurately describes RF models in the quadratic scaling regime. We derive sharp asymptotics for the training and test errors in this setting, which continue to agree with numerical simulations even when GET fails.\n  Our analysis combines general results on CLT for Wiener chaos expansions and a careful two-phase Lindeberg swapping argument.

The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state.

This study investigates the implementation of AI-driven document redaction within UK public authorities through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.

Based on responses from 44 public authorities across healthcare, government, and higher education sectors, this study reveals significant gaps between technological possibilities and organizational realities. Findings show highly limited AI adoption (only one authority reported using AI tools), widespread absence of formal redaction policies (50 percent reported \"information not held\"), and deficiencies in staff training. The study identifies three key barriers to effective AI implementation: poor record-keeping practices, lack of standardized redaction guidelines, and insufficient specialized training for human oversight.

Analytic FL (AFL) provides a single-round, data distribution invariant solution, but is limited to linear models. Subsequent non-linear approaches, like DeepAFL, regain accuracy but sacrifice the single-round benefit. In this work, we break this trade-off. We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings.

Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u71b5\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u76d1\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e94\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\uff0c\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u6291\u5236\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea680%\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7387\u5d4c\u5165\u76d1\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance.

We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a \"momentum-like\" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution.

We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making.

However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings.

In this study, we present Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding (AaPE), a drop-in patch stem that mitigates aliasing while preserving high-frequency information. AaPE augments standard patch tokens with features produced by a band-limited complex sinusoidal kernel using a two-sided exponential window that dynamically targets alias-prone bands. Frequency and decay parameters of the kernel are estimated from the input, enabling parallel, adaptive subband analysis whose outputs are fused with the standard patch tokens.

Pre-training on AudioSet followed by fine-tuning evaluation across diverse downstream benchmarks, which spanned categories, such as environmental sounds and other common audio domains.

Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products.

Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability.

However, such an exposure strategy can also reinforce users' existing preferences, leading to a notorious phenomenon named filter bubbles. Given its negative effects, such as group polarization, increasing attention has been paid to exploring reasonable measures to filter bubbles. However, most existing evaluation metrics simply measure the diversity of user exposure, failing to distinguish between algorithmic preference modeling and actual information confinement. In view of this, we introduce Bubble Escape Potential (BEP), a behavior-aware measure that quantifies how easily users can escape from filter bubbles. Specifically, BEP leverages a contrastive simulation framework that assigns different behavioral tendencies (e.g., positive vs. negative) to synthetic users and compares the induced exposure patterns. This design enables decoupling the effect of filter bubbles and preference modeling, allowing for more precise diagnosis of bubble severity. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple recommendation models to examine the relationship between predictive accuracy and bubble escape potential across different groups. To the best of our knowledge, our empirical results are the first to quantitatively validate the dilemma between preference modeling and filter bubbles. What's more, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon that mild random recommendations are ineffective in alleviating filter bubbles, which can offer a principled foundation for further work in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cfBEP\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7528\u6237\u9003\u79bb\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u7684\u96be\u6613\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u95f4\u7684\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u8f7b\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4fe1\u606f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BEP\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u7528\u6237\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u7684\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f7b\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u63a8\u8350\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "BEP\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u6c14\u6ce1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard \"think-then-answer\" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps.

However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using \u010cech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\uff0c\u9610\u660eUMAP\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e38\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u8131\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u4e0a\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5176\u4e0e\u9762\u504f\u5e8f\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u660eUMAP\u6a21\u7cca\u6743\u91cd\u6e90\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u660e\u786eKullback - Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e03\u5c14\u8fd0\u7b97\u6062\u590d\u6807\u51c6t - \u8303\u6570\u548ct - \u4f59\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6982\u7387\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3a\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9610\u660eUMAP\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While existing frameworks and taxonomies document bias or harms in isolation, they rarely establish systematic links between specific bias types and the harms they cause, particularly within real-world sociotechnical contexts. Technical fixes proposed to address AI biases are ill-equipped to address them and are typically applied after a system has been developed or deployed, offering limited preventive value. We propose ECHO, a novel framework for proactive AI harm anticipation through the systematic mapping of AI bias types to harm outcomes across diverse stakeholder and domain contexts. ECHO follows a modular workflow encompassing stakeholder identification, vignette-based presentation of biased AI systems, and dual (human-LLM) harm annotation, integrated within ethical matrices for structured interpretation. This human-centered approach enables early-stage detection of bias-to-harm pathways, guiding AI design and governance decisions from the outset.

CE and squared loss generate fundamentally different dynamics, and convex linear models cannot capture the complexities of non-convex optimization. We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown. This model coincides with the unconstrained features model used to study neural collapse, making our work the first to prove that gradient flow on CE converges to the neural collapse geometry. We construct an explicit Lyapunov function that establishes global convergence, despite the presence of spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. A key insight underlying our analysis is an inconspicuous finding: Hadamard Initialization diagonalizes the softmax operator, freezing the singular vectors of the weight matrices and reducing the dynamics entirely to their singular values.

However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms.

The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs. BlendedNet++ provides a unified forward and inverse protocol with multi-model baselines, enabling fair, reproducible comparison across architectures and optimization paradigms.

In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications.

However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front.

This raises a key question: \\textbf{can LVLMs perceive such camouflaged harmful content as sensitively as humans do?} In this paper, we introduce CamHarmTI, a benchmark for evaluating LVLM ability to perceive and interpret camouflaged harmful content within text-image compositions. CamHarmTI consists of over 4,500 samples across three types of image-text posts. Experiments on 100 human users and 12 mainstream LVLMs reveal a clear perceptual gap: humans easily recognize such content (e.g., over 95.75\\% accuracy), whereas current LVLMs often fail (e.g., ChatGPT-4o achieves only 2.10\\% accuracy). Moreover, fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that \\bench serves as an effective resource for improving model perception, increasing accuracy by 55.94\\% for Qwen2.5VL-7B. Attention analysis and layer-wise probing further reveal that fine-tuning enhances sensitivity primarily in the early layers of the vision encoder, promoting a more integrated scene understanding.

Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation.

In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI.

We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRTFM\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6RTFM\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eTabPFN V2\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5f52\u4e00\u5316AUC\u6700\u9ad8\u589e\u52a06%\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u4e0d\u523010\u4e07\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

A common approach identifies seed nodes by first detecting disjoint communities and subsequently selecting representative nodes from these communities. However, whether the quality of detected communities consistently affects the spread of influence under the Independent Cascade model remains unclear. This paper addresses this question by extending a previously proposed disjoint community detection method, termed $\u03b1$-Hierarchical Clustering, to the influence maximization problem under the Independent Cascade model. The proposed method is compared with an alternative approach that employs the same seed selection criteria but relies on communities of lower quality obtained through standard Hierarchical Clustering. The former is referred to as Hierarchical Clustering-based Influence Maximization, while the latter, which leverages higher-quality community structures to guide seed selection, is termed $\u03b1$-Hierarchical Clustering-based Influence Maximization. Extensive experiments are performed on multiple real-world datasets to assess the effectiveness of both methods. The results demonstrate that higher-quality community structures substantially improve information diffusion under the Independent Cascade model, particularly when the propagation probability is low.

While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs.

Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design.

To this end, we first systematically evaluate the vulnerability of RAG- and SFT-based LLMs to various MIAs.

Comprehensive experiments show that, on average, EPD reduces MIA success by up to 27.8\\% for SFT and 526.3\\% for RAG compared to inference-time baseline, while maintaining answer quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30RAG\u548cSFT\u7684LLMs\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEPD\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "RAG\u548cSFT\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u66b4\u9732\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30RAG\u548cSFT\u7684LLMs\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6EPD\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165LLM\u3001\u57fa\u7840LLM\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u800c\u8a00\uff0cEPD\u76f8\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7fSFT\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e27.8%\uff0cRAG\u964d\u4f4e526.3%\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "EPD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aRAG\u548cSFT\u7684LLMs\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases.

Resource availability may be an issue as it is directly impacted by the current device workload, adding to the uncertainty of model deployment. We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2).

BEAT-CF (Bayesian evidence-adaptive treatment of CF) was established to build an evidence-informed knowledge base for CF management.

The causal model describes relationships between background risk factors, treatments, and pathogen colonisation of the airways that affect the outcome of an individual PEx episode. The key factors, outcomes, and causal relationships were elicited from CF clinical experts and together represent current expert understanding of the pathophysiology of a PEx episode, guiding the design of data collection and studies and enabling causal inference.

However, pan-cancer research still faces two key challenges: learning discriminative and efficient single-cell representations, and establishing a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we introduce PanFoMa, a lightweight hybrid neural network that combines the strengths of Transformers and state-space models to achieve a balance between performance and efficiency. PanFoMa consists of a front-end local-context encoder with shared self-attention layers to capture complex, order-independent gene interactions; and a back-end global sequential feature decoder that efficiently integrates global context using a linear-time state-space model. This modular design preserves the expressive power of Transformers while leveraging the scalability of Mamba to enable transcriptome modeling, effectively capturing both local and global regulatory signals. To enable robust evaluation, we also construct a large-scale pan-cancer single-cell benchmark, PanFoMaBench, containing over 3.5 million high-quality cells across 33 cancer subtypes, curated through a rigorous preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results show that PanFoMa outperforms state-of-the-art models on our pan-cancer benchmark (+4.0\\%) and across multiple public tasks, including cell type annotation (+7.4\\%), batch integration (+4.0\\%) and multi-omics integration (+3.1\\%).

Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains.

Consequently, understanding training-data leakage in these systems is increasingly critical. Log-probability-based membership inference attacks (MIAs) have become a widely adopted approach for assessing data exposure in large language models (LLMs), yet their effect in MLLMs remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of extending these text-based MIA methods to multimodal settings. Our experiments under vision-and-text (V+T) and text-only (T-only) conditions across the DeepSeek-VL and InternVL model families show that in in-distribution settings, logit-based MIAs perform comparably across configurations, with a slight V+T advantage. Conversely, in out-of-distribution settings, visual inputs act as regularizers, effectively masking membership signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIAs\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIAs\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\uff08V+T\uff09\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\uff08T-only\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9DeepSeek - VL\u548cInternVL\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u7684MIAs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0cV+T\u7a0d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u8d77\u5230\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a9\u76d6\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations.

We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting.

However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities.

Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set.

Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (up to 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) but their adoption has until recently been limited to research environments due to challenges with peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds and gradient non-uniformity. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting applied to ultra-strong gradients enhances prostate cancer characterization relative to current clinical acquisitions. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron (Dense MLP) and convolutional U-Net architectures, benchmarking them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. Dense ssVERDICT at ultra-strong gradient notably outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled f_ic variation by 50%. Overall, it delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional methods and clinical gradient systems.

Many Text2KG methods, however, rely on iterative LLM prompting, making them computationally expensive and prone to overlooking complex relations distributed throughout the text. To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k.

We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff08JPM\uff09\u5904\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dJPM\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea621%\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NACC\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0Mallows\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u6587\u732e\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\uff08EBMs\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ec5\u60a3\u5355\u4e00\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165JPM\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76JPM\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u5c16\u9510\u5ea6\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709JPM\u53d8\u4f53\u90fd\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5c16\u9510\u5ea6\u56e0\u53d8\u4f53\u800c\u5f02\u4e14\u53ef\u7531\u8f93\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dJPM\u6bd4SA - EBM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea621%\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528NACC\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0Mallows\u53d8\u4f53\u548cSA - EBM\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u6587\u732e\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "JPM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$.

Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\\Box$ and $\\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.\n  This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation.

We cast this challenge as learning both the communication topology and the alignment maps that govern information exchange among agents, yielding a learned network sheaf equipped with orthogonal maps. This learning process is further supported by a semantic denoising end compression module that constructs a shared global semantic space and derives sparse, structured representations of each agent's latent space.

By jointly minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and ground-truth conductivity maps and enforcing consistency with the forward PDE, PhyDNN reduces the black-box nature of deep networks and improves both physical plausibility and generalization.

However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions.

It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.\n  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5916\u5728\u56de\u5f52\uff08TSER\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAGNETS\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TSER\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\uff0c\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAGNETS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u6ce8\u91ca\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u805a\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u900f\u660e\u52a0\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MAGNETS\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709TSER\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u6e05\u6670\u5c55\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Because these frameworks are computationally expensive, large-scale applications often rely on closed-form solutions for Gaussian distributions under quadratic cost. This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds.

We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\\pm$2.10.

While scaling model size mitigates this \\citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation.

We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts.

This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures.

We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness.

The methodology includes quantum data embedding with entanglement enhancement, variational quantum graph convolutions with non-linear dynamics, extraction of higher-order topological invariants, hybrid quantum-classical anomaly learning with adaptive optimization, and interpretable decision-making via topological attribution. Rigorous convergence guarantees ensure stable training on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, while stability of topological signatures provides robust fraud detection. Optimized for NISQ hardware with circuit simplifications and graph sampling, the framework scales to large transaction networks. Simulations on financial datasets, such as PaySim and Elliptic, benchmark QTGNN against classical and quantum baselines, using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and false positive rate. An ablation study evaluates the contributions of quantum embeddings, topological features, non-linear channels, and hybrid learning.

Our approach extracts low-dimensional state representations, identifies quasi-Hamiltonian structures through physics-constrained optimization, and quantifies structural changes via energy landscape comparison. Analysis of London's extreme rainfall in 2021 demonstrates that while surface indicators were fully recovered, our algorithm detected 64.8\\% structural damage missed by traditional monitoring.

However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models.

This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning.

This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDreamerV3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528MLP - VAE\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u7ef4LIDAR\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9646\u5730\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u4e8eLIDAR\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53ca\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6837\u672c\u4f4e\u6548\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387LIDAR\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eDreamerV3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210MLP - VAE\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4LIDAR\u8bfb\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62dfTurtleBot3\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4SAC\u3001DDPG\u548cTD3\u7b49\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Turtlebot3 LIDAR\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u4e8e85%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ef4\u611f\u5b98\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

Under Review", "summary": "Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.

We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics.

In this paper, we study novel deep learning technologies to effectively manage and analyse ECG data, with the aim of building a diagnostic model, accurately and quickly, that can substantially reduce the burden on medical workers. Unlike the existing ECG models that exhibit a high misdiagnosis rate, our deep learning approaches can automatically extract the features of ECG data through end-to-end training. Specifically, we first devise EfficientECG, an accurate and lightweight classification model for ECG analysis based on the existing EfficientNet model, which can effectively handle high-frequency long-sequence ECG data with various leading types. On top of that, we next propose a cross-attention-based feature fusion model of EfficientECG for analysing multi-lead ECG data with multiple features (e.g., gender and age).

At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline.

Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($\u03bb$,$\u03bb$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that DDQN equipped with our adaptive reward shifting strategy achieves performance comparable to theoretically derived policies with vastly improved sample efficiency, outperforming prior DAC approaches by several orders of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u914d\u7f6e\uff08DAC\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790DDQN\u548cPPO\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684DDQN\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3DAC\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728DAC\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236(1+(\u03bb,\u03bb)) - GA\u5728OneMax\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9DDQN\u548cPPO\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u548c\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0DDQN\u548cPPO\u5728DAC\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3DDQN\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3DDQN\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u91ce\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0cPPO\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u914d\u5907\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u7684DDQN\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684DAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do.

Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance.

DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity.

Recent studies have shown how using traditionally trained estimators for this task can lead to suboptimal solutions. Using the actual decision cost as a loss function (called Decision Focused Learning) can address this issue, but with a severe loss of scalability at training time. To address this issue, we propose an acceleration method based on replacing costly loss function evaluations with an efficient surrogate. Unlike previously defined surrogates, our approach relies on unbiased estimators reducing the risk of spurious local optima and can provide information on its local confidence allowing one to switch to a fallback method when needed. Furthermore, the surrogate is designed for a black-box setting, which enables compensating for simplifications in the optimization model and account- ing for recourse actions during cost computation.

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information.

Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback.

The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0.

Standard VAEs match latents to a simple prior, overlooking density structure in the data-space. DiVAE encourages the encoder to allocate posterior mass in proportion to data-space density and, when the prior is learnable, nudges the prior toward high-density regions.

While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural content creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCookAnything\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u70f9\u996a\u98df\u8c31\u63d2\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u5904\u7406\u70f9\u996a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u98df\u8c31\u63d2\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u98df\u8c31\u957f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCookAnything\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542bStep - wise Regional Control (SRC)\u3001Flexible RoPE\u3001Cross - Step Consistency Control (CSCC)\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u98df\u8c31\u63d2\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCookAnything\u5728\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters.

Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on \"how to intervene\" but overlooking the prerequisite \"when to intervene\", which leads to the \"over-intervention\" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected.

However, such approaches fail to distinguish between high-value and low-value actions in their regularization components. We introduce Guided Flow Policy (GFP), which couples a multi-step flow-matching policy with a distilled one-step actor. The actor directs the flow policy through weighted behavior cloning to focus on cloning high-value actions from the dataset rather than indiscriminately imitating all state-action pairs. In turn, the flow policy constrains the actor to remain aligned with the dataset's best transitions while maximizing the critic. This mutual guidance enables GFP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across 144 state and pixel-based tasks from the OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, with substantial gains on suboptimal datasets and challenging tasks.

Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines. PEGP-ARZ proves more reliable under sparse observation, while PEGP-LWR achieves lower errors with denser observation. Ablation study further reveals that PEGP-ARZ residuals align closely with physics and yield calibrated, interpretable uncertainty, whereas PEGP-LWR residuals are more orthogonal and produce nearly constant variance fields.

This work proposes the use of machine learning to learn the traffic pattern generated in networks based on the TSCH protocol, in order to turn nodes into a deep sleep state when no transmission is planned and thus to improve the energy efficiency of the WSN. The ability of machine learning models to make good predictions at different network levels in a typical tree network topology was analyzed in depth, showing how their capabilities degrade while approaching the root of the tree. The application of these models on simulated data based on an accurate modeling of wireless sensor nodes indicates that the investigated algorithms can be suitably used to further and substantially reduce the power consumption of a TSCH network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8eTSCH\u534f\u8bae\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\uff08WSN\uff09\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eTSCH\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8d85\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u4e00\u5b9a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cTSCH\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8eTSCH\u534f\u8bae\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9\u65e0\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u8fdb\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u7761\u7720\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9760\u8fd1\u6811\u6839\u65f6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eTSCH\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eTSCH\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8WSN\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u3002"}}

We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework.

We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification. FANTA leverages multi-layered communicative phenomena by integrating information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning.

Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets.

However, with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters, single-batch autoregressive inference suffers from extremely low arithmetic intensity, creating severe weight-loading and bandwidth pressures on resource-constrained platforms. Recent in-flash computing (IFC) solutions alleviate this bottleneck by co-locating weight-related linear computations in the decode phase with flash, yet still rely on DRAM for the key-value (KV) cache. As context length grows, the KV cache can exceed model weights in size, imposing prohibitive DRAM cost and capacity requirements. Attempts to offload KV cache to flash suffer from severe performance penalties.\n  We propose KVNAND, the first DRAM-free, IFC-based architecture that stores both model weights and KV cache entirely in compute-enabled 3D NAND flash. KVNAND addresses the fundamental performance challenges of flash under intensive KV cache access by leveraging IFC for all memory-bound operations to reduce data transfer overhead, introducing head-group parallelism to boost throughput, and employing page-level KV cache mapping to align token access patterns with flash organization.

While fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for detecting unauthorized model usage, existing methods -- whether behavior-based or structural -- suffer from vulnerabilities such as false claim attacks or susceptible to weight manipulations. To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks.

Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements.

This issue, known as hallucination, is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains like clinical applications, where factual inaccuracies can have severe consequences. Existing evaluation metrics fail to adequately assess factual consistency and lack interpretability, making diagnosing and mitigating errors difficult. We propose an interpretable framework for factual consistency assessment for in-domain and open-domain texts to address these limitations. Our approach decomposes text into atomic facts and introduces a flexible, schema-free methodology.

However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this work, we propose to train steerable policies for managing this uncertainty using self-play. Given two agents, one simulating a user and the other an AI assistant, we generate conversations where the user issues a potentially ambiguous query, and the assistant needs to determine how to respond. Importantly, the model takes as input the numerical cost of each clarification question, and each generated word, and is asked to take the action that will maximize its final reward, which is the cost-penalized accuracy. We use Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) to train our model to achieve high reward and show this leads to a steerable policy that changes its behavior predictably conditioned on the provided costs, leading to higher reward and accuracy.

However, challenges persist, especially in detecting small objects where the high resolution of these images and the small size of target objects often result in a loss of critical information in the deeper layers of conventional CNNs. Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images.

In this paper, we propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMAPS\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u5e76\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CoT\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u601d\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMAPS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6CoT\uff0c\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u4e13\u4e1a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "MAPS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \\textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \\textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \\textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.\n  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.\n  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u805a\u7126EaaS\u6c34\u5370\u62b5\u5fa1\u6a21\u4eff\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u88ab\u91ca\u4e49\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672fWET\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "EaaS\u6613\u53d7\u6a21\u4eff\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4EaaS\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u91ca\u4e49\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73b0\u6709EaaS\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u7684WET\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5411\u53d8\u6362\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6c34\u5370\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709EaaS\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u88ab\u91ca\u4e49\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff0cWET\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u91ca\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709EaaS\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u6709\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0cWET\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u91ca\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

However, their uniform token processing paradigm introduces critical vulnerabilities in instruction handling, particularly when exposed to adversarial scenarios. In this work, we identify and propose a novel class of vulnerabilities, termed Tool-Completion Attack (TCA), which exploits function-calling mechanisms to subvert model behavior. To evaluate LLM robustness against such threats, we introduce the Tool-Completion benchmark, a comprehensive security assessment framework, which reveals that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to TCA, with surprisingly high attack success rates. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks.

Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box.

To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model.

The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks.

The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \\textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \\textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO.

Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55QSP\u6846\u67b6\u539f\u4f4d\u5b66\u4e60\u8109\u51b2\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8109\u51b2\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55QSP\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u8109\u51b2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u7ea7\u7684\u6a21\u62df - \u6570\u5b57\u6620\u5c04\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u6392\u5e8f\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5e73\u6ed1\u8109\u51b2\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9SPAM\u548c\u53bb\u6781\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u5f3a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u3002"}}

The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer. Results show that MPCFormer achieves the highest planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and reduces the collision rate from 21.25% to 0.5%, outperforming a frontier Reinforcement Learning (RL) based planner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMPCFormer\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u793e\u4f1a\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528MPC\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c5\u79d2\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4ADE\u4f4e\u81f30.86\u7c73\uff1b\u95ed\u73af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe94.67%\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6548\u738715.75%\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u4ece21.25%\u964d\u81f30.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "MPCFormer\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u610f\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Project page: https://waabi.ai/flux4d/", "summary": "Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f4D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684Flux4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u4e14\u9700\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Flux4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5149\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u201c\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u9759\u6001\u201d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u8de8\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u79d2\u5185\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6237\u5916\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlux4D\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined. We further propose an evaluation framework that separates Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks into standard and diverse subsets to assess linguistic generalization. Results show that models trained on both standard and diverse data consistently outperform those trained on standard corpora, improving performance across all task types without compromising standard benchmark accuracy.

However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51faVINE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00 - \u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u5931\u8d25\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7684VINE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff08System 2\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\uff08System 1\uff09\uff0cSystem 2\u57282D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0cSystem 1\u6267\u884c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5931\u8d25\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5c06VLA\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u6267\u884c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

An operational challenge in this design is load balancing: routing tokens to minimize the number of idle experts, which is important for the efficient utilization of (costly) GPUs. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) procedure -- proposed by DeepSeek's Wang et al. (2024) -- by casting it as a one-step-per-iteration primal-dual method for an assignment problem. First, in a stylized deterministic setting, our framework yields several insightful structural properties: (i) a monotonic improvement of a Lagrangian objective, (ii) a preference rule that moves tokens from overloaded to underloaded experts, and (iii) an approximate-balancing guarantee. Then, we incorporate the stochastic and dynamic nature of AI training using a generalized online optimization formulation.

To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets.

We model EHR-mediated HCP interactions as networks and apply machine learning techniques to detect predictive signals of patient survival embedded in these collaborations. Our models are cross validated to ensure generalizability, and we explain the predictions by identifying key network traits associated with improved outcomes. Importantly, clinical experts and literature validate the relevance of the identified crucial collaboration traits, reinforcing their potential for real-world applications.

However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries.

TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination.

We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data.

Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTARA\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e8f\u8d2f\u9785\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTARA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709TARA - k\u548cTARA - m\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "TARA - k\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50 - \u7ecf\u5178\u533a\u5206\u7684ROC AUC = 0.96\uff1bTARA - m\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u88d5\u5ea6\u8fbe36%\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6821\u51c6\u4f1a\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u865a\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "TARA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5272\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills.

First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2.

Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model.

In addition, we show how the generator Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (gEDMD) method, which was developed in the context of Koopman operator methods, can be used to model the CG dynamics and evaluate its kinetic properties, such as transition timescales. Finally, we combine our approach with thermodynamic interpolation (TI), a generative approach to transform samples between thermodynamic conditions, to extend the scope of the approach across thermodynamic states without repeated numerical simulations.

However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions.

Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u5168\u8f66\u8f86\u4e3b\u52a8\u60ac\u67b6\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u60ac\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a7\u5236\u52aa\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u60ac\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u56fa\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u4f46\u96c6\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u60ac\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u878d\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7269\u7406\u60ac\u67b6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u548c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea643%\u548c52%\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e58\u5750\u8212\u9002\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

They enable microscopic insights into material behavior through Molecular Dynamics simulations, which can crucially expedite material design and discovery. However, insufficiently broad and systematically biased reference data affect the predictive quality of the learned models. Often, these models exhibit significant deviations from experimentally observed phase transition temperatures, in the order of several hundred kelvins. Thus, fine-tuning is necessary to achieve adequate accuracy in many practical problems. This work proposes a fine-tuning strategy via top-down learning, directly correcting the wrongly predicted transition temperatures to match the experimental reference data. Our approach leverages the Differentiable Trajectory Reweighting algorithm to minimize the free energy differences between phases at the experimental target pressures and temperatures. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately correct the phase diagram of pure Titanium in a pressure range of up to 5 GPa, matching the experimental reference within tenths of kelvins and improving the liquid-state diffusion constant.

Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u591a\u516d\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u5173\u8054\u5e76\u5b8c\u5584\u56fe\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "Bell\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0d\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5df2\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u516d\u4e2a\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8282\u70b9\u4e2d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u51b3\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\u65bd\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5b8c\u5584\u6700\u591a\u516d\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u6301\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u8fd8\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u6700\u591a\u516d\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
