The huge size becomes a limiting factor for broader adoption, and\nits fast growth rate will soon exhaust all the available storage devices. To\naddress these issues, we present EBCC (Error Bounded Climate-data Compressor).\nIt follows a two-layer approach: a base compression layer using JPEG2000 to\ncapture the bulk of the data with a high compression ratio, and a residual\ncompression layer using wavelet transform and SPIHT encoding to efficiently\neliminate long-tail extreme errors introduced by the base compression layer. It\nincorporates a feedback rate-control mechanism for both layers that adjusts\ncompression ratios to achieve the specified maximum error target. We evaluate\nEBCC alongside other established compression methods on benchmarks related to\nweather and climate science including error statistics, a case study on\nprimitive and derived variables near a hurricane, evaluation of the closure of\nthe global energy budget, and a Lagrangian air parcel trajectory simulation.\nThis is the first time that trajectory simulation is used to benchmark\ncompression methods. Our method concentrates most errors near zero, while\nothers tend to distribute errors uniformly within the error bound. EBCC\noutperforms other methods in the benchmarks at relative error targets ranging\nfrom 0.1% to 10% and achieves compression ratios from 15x to more than 300x. In\nthe energy budget closure and Lagrangian trajectory benchmarks, it can achieve\nmore than 100x compression while keeping errors within natural variability\nderived from ERA5 uncertainty members. This verifies the effectiveness of EBCC\nin creating heavily compressed weather and climate datasets suitable for\ndownstream applications.

It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes\nback from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI\nadvances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the\nintermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal\nconnections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated\ncausal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for\nhow long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically\nrigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The\nforward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR\ntraces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal\npredictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase,\nrespectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced,\neliminating the need for empirical thresholds.

We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the\nasset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying\nBayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate\ndynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band\ncontributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and\nlong-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe\nratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then\nrationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that\nthe medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The\nresulting \"barbell\" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures\nmost of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges\nthe common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and\nsuggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary\nredundancy in trend premia."}

This design allows the model to learn biologically\ncoherent patterns of cooperative and antagonistic modifications while\naddressing the dual long-tail distribution of PTM data. Across multiple\nproteome-scale benchmarks, COMPASS-PTM establishes new state-of-the-art\nperformance, including a 122% relative F1 improvement in multi-label site\nprediction and a 54% gain in zero-shot enzyme assignment. Beyond accuracy, the\nmodel demonstrates interpretable generalization, recovering canonical kinase\nmotifs and predicting disease-associated PTM rewiring caused by missense\nvariants. By bridging statistical learning with biochemical mechanism,\nCOMPASS-PTM unifies site-level and enzyme-level prediction into a single\nframework that learns the grammar underlying protein regulation and signaling."}

On the other hand, a posteriori methods often\nnecessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them\ninefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces\na Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve\nmulti-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously.\nSpecifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian\nperspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence,\nenabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions,\nultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively\nsuppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various\nSAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically\nvalidated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority\nover peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios.

This\npaper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically\nacross horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the\noptimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common\npractice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally\nfrom all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and\nempirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the\nasset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying\nBayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate\ndynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band\ncontributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and\nlong-term components are included.

While\n$k=2$ coincides with monotonicity testing, far less is known for $k>2$.\n  We initiate a systematic study of pattern freeness on higher-dimensional\ngrids. For $d=2$ and all permutations of size $k=3$, we design an adaptive\none-sided tester with query complexity $O(n^{4/5+o(1)})$. We also prove general\nlower bounds for $k=3$: every nonadaptive tester requires $\\Omega(n)$ queries,\nand every adaptive tester requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ queries, yielding the\nfirst super-logarithmic lower bounds for $\\pi$-freeness. For the monotone\npatterns $\\pi=(1,2,3)$ and $(3,2,1)$, we present a nonadaptive tester with\npolylogarithmic query complexity, giving an exponential separation between\nmonotone and nonmonotone patterns (unlike the one-dimensional case).\n  A key ingredient in our $\\pi$-freeness testers is new erasure-resilient\n($\\delta$-ER) $\\epsilon$-testers for monotonicity over $[n]^d$ with query\ncomplexity $O(\\log^{O(d)}n/(\\epsilon(1-\\delta)))$, where $0<\\delta<1$ is an\nupper bound on the fraction of erasures.

We study two aspects of the problem: (1) the technical\nmethod for implementing confidence calibration and improving the reliability of\ncode generation models, and (2) the human-centered design principles for\neffectively communicating reliability signal to developers. First, we develop a\nscalable and flexible calibration framework which can be used to obtain\ncalibration weights for open-source models using any dataset, and evaluate\nwhether calibrators improve the alignment between model confidence and\ndeveloper acceptance behavior. Through a large-scale analysis of over 24\nmillion real-world developer interactions across multiple programming\nlanguages, we find that a general, post-hoc calibration model based on\nPlatt-scaling does not, on average, improve the reliability of model confidence\nsignals. We also find that while dynamically personalizing calibration to\nindividual users can be effective, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nvolume of user interaction data. Second, we conduct a multi-phase design study\nwith 3 expert designers and 153 professional developers, combining\nscenario-based design, semi-structured interviews, and survey validation,\nrevealing a clear preference for presenting reliability signals via\nnon-numerical, color-coded indicators within the in-editor code generation\nworkflow."}

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph\ndiscusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,\nand diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between\narbitrary times.

Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We\nalso demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data\nscale, is key to defending against novel attacks.\n\\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{Warning: This paper contains content that may be\nharmful or offensive in nature."}

Additionally, our results suggest\nthat stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be\nachieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but\nrather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other\nmachine learning settings (via scale).

However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach.

AniDS\nintroduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce\natom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to\nbetter reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.\nThese covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic\ncorrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting\ncovariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and\nSO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular\ndynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and\nhomoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22\nbenchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force\nprediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows\nthat AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent\nwith physicochemical principles.

The key challenge is to balance the potential\ntradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves\nforgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's\noriginal performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use\nmulti-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and\nutility preservation objectives.

We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to\nunilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the\nadditional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an\nimplicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the\naforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,\nthereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU.

The key finding is that the medium-term band\ncontributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and\nlong-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe\nratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then\nrationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that\nthe medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The\nresulting \"barbell\" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures\nmost of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges\nthe common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and\nsuggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary\nredundancy in trend premia."}

More\ncritically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the\napplication of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety\nand predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the\nboundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally\nundecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents\nby extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative\nrisk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static\nanalysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks."}

This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling\nMachine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these\ncritical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial\nIntelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the\nuncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as\nopposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby\nempowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from\noverconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.\n  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network\n(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief\nfunctions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty\nthrough the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including\nits adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather\nclassification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a\nunified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers.

Replay-based approaches in\ncontinual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,\nminimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances\nfrom past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the\nfixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome\nthis limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel\naugmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the\nreplay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with\nthree datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to\nassess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and\ndemonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based\napproaches."}

Uniquely, at each time\nstep $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by\napplying the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for\nclassical Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each\npotential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link\nprobability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily\nconnected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant\ndistributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across\nagents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the\nglobal mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean\nrewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed\nalgorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip\nalgorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\\log\nT$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the\noptimal centralized regret $O\\left(\\sum_{k: \\Delta_k>0} \\frac{\\log\nT}{\\Delta_k}\\right)$ and an additional term $O\\left(\\frac{N^2 \\log T}{p\n\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \\frac{KN^2 \\log T}{p}\\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote\nthe total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the\nimpact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link\nprobability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between\ncommunication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal\nregret lower bound.

Recent\nadvances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,\nhave underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer\nfrom high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we\nrevisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing\nthe decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation\npipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding\nmethods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.\nMotivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that\nintroduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features\nextracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that\nLanguage Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,\nwhile requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the\ncomputational overhead during both training and inference stages.

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory.

Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking.

We approach this question by introducing appropriate\nsimplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a\ntestbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is\nSpectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\\Sigma\nV^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we\nidentify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD\noutperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both\nlinear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning\ndominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal\ncomponents of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a\ngrowing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further\nshow that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive\nstep-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,\nwe show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our\ntheoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets.

To address this critical issue, we consider introducing\ncollaborative beamforming (CB) of UAVs and omnidirectional reconfigurable\nbeamforming (ORB) of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) to enhance the signal quality and\ndirectionality. On this basis, we formulate a joint rate and energy\noptimization problem (JREOP) to maximize the transmission rate of the overall\nsystem, while minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV swarm. Due to the\nnon-convex and NP-hard nature of JREOP, we propose a heterogeneous multi-agent\ncollaborative dynamic (HMCD) optimization framework, which has two core\ncomponents. The first component is a simulated annealing (SA)-based STAR-RIS\ncontrol method, which dynamically optimizes reflection and transmission\ncoefficients to enhance signal propagation. The second component is an improved\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) control method, which\nincorporates a self-attention evaluation mechanism to capture interactions\nbetween UAVs and an adaptive velocity transition mechanism to enhance training\nstability.

Although existing methods\ndemonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their\neffect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains\nlargely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on\nlong-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in\nmodern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more\ncomputation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\npruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with\nperformance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when\nperformance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.\nFurthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to\nrecover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated.

The advent of large\nlanguage models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly\ntransformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently\n(e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models). While scaling to ultra-long user histories\n(10k to 100k items) generally improves model performance, it also creates\nsignificant challenges on latency, queries per second (QPS) and GPU cost in\nindustry-scale recommendation systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention\n(VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to\nuser history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization\ninto a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those\ntokens.

We introduce\ncomputational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready\ncausal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured\nCausal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy\nfunctions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and\ninterventions act by local surgery on those constraints.

The research includes detailed linguistic documentation\ncollected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,\ntrilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a\nTransformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional\nmorphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood\ndistinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect\nword-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also\ndeveloped to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for\npreserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic\nmethodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological\ninnovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for\ncommunity-based language revitalization."}

This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use.

Such a\ndependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each\nsubtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,\nexplicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot\ncapabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from\nassignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition\nand scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM\nimproves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and\nachieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion.

However, a key limitation is the requirement for large\namounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.\nTo tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev\nSubspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data\ngeneration by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked\nby existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier\ntransform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and\nconstructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from\npreviously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing\nredundant computations.

The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct\nlabel, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize\nregret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizon $T$ is\nat least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry\nof the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based\nClassifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and\ncalls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^d T)$ regret in $T$ and is minimax optimal for $d=1$.\nOtherwise, the geometry cannot be reliably learned without additional\ndistributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a\nsubgaussian mixture, for $T \\le e^d$, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves\nregret proportional to $N\\log{N}$ where $N$ is the number of labels. To bridge\nthese regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a\npractical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a\ntunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments,\nnotably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from\nstate-of-the-art large language models."}

We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal\ninteractions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and\ninteraction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of\nineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions\nfor a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.\nExisting methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning\nprocess, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,\nespecially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.\nTo cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which\ncontains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and\nlink history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information\nthrough transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA\nprevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being\nforgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly\nand readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment\nresults on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)\ndatasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance\nof the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings.

However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation.

This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally\nconstrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to\nreproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train\nand test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models\ntrained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.\nAs policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,\nsince defining \"success\" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of\nexecution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework\nthat overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale\nsimulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging\nadvances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and\ndifferentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video\ndemonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.\nWithin these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated\nVLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from\ncrowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,\nresetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To\nmeasure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along\nmultiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy\ngeneralization under controlled variation.

One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate\ntemporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional\nkeyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This\ntransforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model\ncontinuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio\ncues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also\nenables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead\ntarget, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the\ntemporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity\nand consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while\nsmaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human\nanimation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,\nidentity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal\nconditioning across several different architectures.
