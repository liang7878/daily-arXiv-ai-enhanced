### [1] [OpenEstimate: Evaluating LLMs on Reasoning Under Uncertainty with Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15096)
*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有语言模型评估与现实应用存在差距，本文引入OpenEstimate基准评估语言模型数值估计任务，发现模型先验不准确且过度自信，该基准可用于评估和开发模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中语言模型需处理不确定信息进行推理，但现有评估多关注有明确答案的问题，且含不确定性的自然问题难构建，导致语言模型在不确定推理方面的性能缺乏评估。

Method: 引入OpenEstimate基准，对六个前沿语言模型在数值估计任务上的先验进行准确性和校准评估。

Result: 语言模型得出的先验往往不准确且过度自信，模型性能受不确定性引出方式影响有小幅提升，受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计影响不大。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate基准为前沿语言模型提供了有挑战性的评估，也为开发更好的概率估计和不确定推理模型提供了平台。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

### [2] [Procedural Game Level Design with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15120)
*Miraç Buğra Özkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于DRL在Unity 3D环境进行程序关卡设计的新方法，含两个代理，结果表明该方法有效并为游戏关卡自主设计带来新机遇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序内容生成（PCG）在游戏开发中流行，期望借助DRL实现更好的程序关卡设计。

Method: 构建由蜂鸟代理和浮岛代理组成的系统，均使用PPO算法训练，蜂鸟导航收集花朵，浮岛根据情况生成花朵布局。

Result: 该方法产生有效且高效的代理行为，为机器学习驱动的游戏关卡自主设计带来新机会。

Conclusion: DRL使智能代理在虚拟环境中生成和解决内容，推动AI在创意游戏开发中的应用。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

### [3] [Towards Error Centric Intelligence I, Beyond Observational Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15128)
*Marcus A. Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文认为AGI发展受理论限制，挑战柏拉图表征假设，提出因果力学及相关结构原则以解决错误发现和纠正问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指出AGI发展受理论限制而非数据或规模限制，挑战柏拉图表征假设，分析观测学习的局限性。

Method: 先奠定知识、学习等概念基础，将问题转化为三个关于错误的问题，进而提出因果力学及相关结构原则。

Result: 提出因果力学，包括假设空间变化为一等操作，使用概率结构；提出使错误发现和纠正可行的结构原则及可操作诊断方法。

Conclusion: 构建一个能将不可达错误转化为可达错误并纠正的系统框架。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

### [4] [HugAgent: Evaluating LLMs in Simulating Human-Like Individual Reasoning on Open-Ended Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15144)
*Chance Jiajie Li,Zhenze Mo,Yuhan Tang,Ao Qu,Jiayi Wu,Kaiya Ivy Zhao,Yulu Gan,Jie Fan,Jiangbo Yu,Hang Jiang,Paul Pu Liang,Jinhua Zhao,Luis Alberto Alonso Pastor,Kent Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出HugAgent基准用于平均到个体推理适应，实验揭示LLMs存在适应差距，基准和聊天机器人已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型近似人类反应但缺乏推理风格和信念轨迹的个体性，为实现更类人的机器推理。

Method: 引入HugAgent基准，采用双轨设计（合成轨道和人类轨道）。

Result: 实验表明当前最先进的大语言模型存在持续的适应差距。

Conclusion: HugAgent是第一个使机器推理与人类思维个体性对齐的可扩展基准。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking
(https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).

### [5] [WELD: A Large-Scale Longitudinal Dataset of Emotional Dynamics for Ubiquitous Affective Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15221)
*Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出含733,651条面部表情记录的职场情感数据集，经技术验证数据质量高，基线实验效果好，可推动多领域研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实职场环境下自动情感识别因缺乏自然环境下大规模纵向数据集而面临挑战，需构建相关数据集。

Method: 在真实办公室环境收集38名员工30.5个月面部表情记录，用深度学习进行表情识别，计算32个扩展情感指标，用随机森林和LSTM模型做基线实验。

Result: 数据成功复现心理模式，对员工离职预测有完美效度，基线实验情感分类准确率91.2%，效价预测R2=0.84。

Conclusion: 该数据集是公开最大最长的纵向职场情感数据集，能推动情感识别等多领域研究。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

### [6] [From Checklists to Clusters: A Homeostatic Account of AGI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15236)
*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有AGI评估存在权重对称和依赖快照分数的问题，提出应按因果中心性加权领域并要求跨会话持久性证据，还给出两个扩展方法及可测试预测和黑盒协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AGI评估中权重对称和快照分数带来的问题，如平等对待所有领域和无法区分持久能力与脆弱表现。

Method: 将通用智能理解为稳态属性簇，提出按领域因果中心性加权，给出中心性优先分数和集群稳定性指数族两个电池兼容扩展。

Result: 所提扩展方法可在保持多领域广度的同时减少脆弱性和作弊情况。

Conclusion: 给出可测试预测和黑盒协议，实验室无需架构访问即可采用。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

### [7] [Multi-dimensional Data Analysis and Applications Basing on LLM Agents and Knowledge Graph Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15258)
*Xi Wang,Xianyao Ling,Kun Li,Gang Yin,Liang Zhang,Jiang Wu,Jun Xu,Fu Zhang,Wenbo Lei,Annie Wang,Peng Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型代理与知识图谱交互的多维数据分析方法，实验显示该方法在多方面有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大数据时代从多维数据提取洞察有挑战，大语言模型处理结构化知识有‘幻觉’且难实时更新，知识图谱静态性限制动态交互和分析能力。

Method: 构建基于大语言模型代理与知识图谱交互的动态协作分析生态系统，利用大语言模型代理从非结构化数据自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户对图节点深度探索分析。

Result: 该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动的探索性分析方面有显著优势。

Conclusion: 此方法为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

*Chenwei Tang,Jingyu Xing,Xinyu Liu,Zizhou Wang,Jiawei Du,Liangli Zhen,Jiancheng Lv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出KG - Agent框架解决无API下LLM代理效率瓶颈，在两个环境测试有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无API软件中，LLM代理存在效率瓶颈，决策短视且依赖低效试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG - Agent框架，将像素级交互构建为SA - KG，设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制。

Result: 在文明V和杀戮尖塔两个复杂环境中测试，相比现有方法在探索效率和战略深度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: KG - Agent框架能有效解决无API下LLM代理效率问题。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [JudgeSQL: Reasoning over SQL Candidates with Weighted Consensus Tournament](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15560)
*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文本到SQL任务有挑战，现有候选查询选择方法有局限，本文提出JudgeSQL框架，实验显示其有更好的SQL判断能力和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到SQL任务中，现有从候选池选择正确查询的方法存在不足，如信号浅、评分不一致等。

Method: 引入JudgeSQL框架，开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，结合强化学习提炼推理轨迹，采用加权共识锦标赛机制整合推理偏好和生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力，有良好的跨尺度泛化性和对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL框架能更可靠、高效地进行SQL候选查询选择。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

### [10] [AUGUSTUS: An LLM-Driven Multimodal Agent System with Contextualized User Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15261)
*Jitesh Jain,Shubham Maheshwari,Ning Yu,Wen-mei Hwu,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 受人类记忆多模态特性启发，提出多模态代理系统AUGUSTUS，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统在增强外部记忆数据库时忽略多模态信号，而人类记忆具有多模态特性。

Method: 系统包含编码、存储、检索、行动4个循环阶段，将信息概念化为语义标签并存储在图结构的多模态上下文记忆中。

Result: 在ImageNet分类中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，在MSC基准上优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS系统表现出色，是有效的多模态代理系统。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for extracting structured information from
invoice documents and proposes a set of evaluation metrics (EM) to assess the
accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

TL;DR: 提出VERITAS管道提升大跨模态模型SFT数据质量，实验表明经其处理的数据微调模型表现更优，还发布相关资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据增强方法因视觉感知不足存在事实错误和幻觉问题，影响大跨模态模型性能，需提升SFT数据质量。

Method: 集成视觉先验、多个先进LMM和统计方法，利用视觉识别和OCR系统提取先验，LMM评估答案，统计融合得分，训练轻量级批评模型，LMM根据批评改进答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，经VERITAS处理数据微调的模型表现优于原始数据微调的模型，批评模型能力强且高效。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升SFT数据质量，推动多模态数据优化研究。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Motivation: 解决模拟集成电路布局中布局工程师对路由感知布局规划解决方案的需求，克服现有机器学习技术应用的限制。

Method: 开发基于强化学习和关系图卷积神经网络的自动布局规划引擎，结合提高网格分辨率、精确引脚信息集成和动态路由资源估计技术。

Conclusion: 所提方法能平衡路由和面积效率，满足工业标准。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 现有文献缺乏可校正且有竞争力的目标规范，可校正性对AI安全很重要。

Method: 给出可校正性的形式化定义，引入转换方法，通过近视地引出基于无成本阻止更新的奖励预测来构建可校正目标，还可对转换进行修改。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明可校正目标能被有效学习，并产生预期行为。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可构建可校正目标，不牺牲性能，对AI训练安全有重要意义。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Conclusion: 战略游戏中的端到端强化学习自博弈训练是开发大语言模型可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code
and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.

Method: 将LoRA适配器作为特定领域工具，让基础大语言模型分析查询并动态选择相关LoRA工具，用LangGraph进行工作流管理。

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds为领域自适应AI辅助提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

Motivation: 现有方法在强化学习中存在判断不一致问题，且先前研究未充分解决逻辑连贯性问题。

Method: 引入综合框架，包含量化判断冲突的冲突检测率（CDR）和在策略优化前去除循环以净化信号的去冲突图奖励（DGR）。

Result: 实验显示该框架相比强基线显著提升训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中重要且可管理的维度。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，受限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降，需要可靠的感应电机故障诊断方法保障工业安全和运行连续性。

Method: 提出Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM - HCAN)，在超图拓扑中集成对比学习进行多模态传感器融合，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖。

Result: 在三个真实基准上，MM - HCAN准确率达99.82%，有强跨域泛化和抗噪性，消融研究验证各组件贡献。

Conclusion: MM - HCAN为综合多故障诊断提供可扩展和鲁棒的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和延长资产寿命。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中时间背景对评估患者健康随时间的关键变化有价值，开发框架整合既往就诊信息以改善健康监测，尤其是在既往就诊有限且频率可变的情况下。

Method: 模型先利用患者最近一次就诊的医疗数据估计疾病初始风险，再用之前收集的影像和/或临床生物标志物信息完善评估。并将框架应用于前列腺癌风险预测。

Result: 在预测就诊时临床显著前列腺癌风险，整合既往信息将假阳性转为真阴性，提高特异性并保持高敏感性；预测就诊后五年内前列腺癌风险，整合既往信息进一步降低假阳性率。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息为提高医学风险预测特异性提供相关背景，充分降低假阳性率可扩大纵向健康监测项目覆盖范围，实现早发现和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法为连接知识与实验执行的可靠科学助手发展铺平道路，数据、代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in

workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present

requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --

Result: 建立了一个用于生成模型对齐的公平性和个性化的理论与算法框架。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够解决现有大语言模型对齐方法的局限性，为不同用户的生成模型对齐提供公平性和个性化保障。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Result: 在三个公共数据集同步和异步设置下实验，TRIP框架表现优于基线，异步设置领先最多16.48个百分点，同步设置领先最多4.86个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架有效且具有适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,

enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and
relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and

path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Motivation: 随着AI聊天机器人在临床医学中应用，为复杂的新兴疾病开发有效框架存在挑战，需解决长新冠临床问答问题。

Method: 开发并评估六种RAG语料库配置，用LLM - as - a - judge框架，基于新数据集LongCOVID - CQ，从忠实性、相关性和全面性指标评估。

Result: 结合临床指南与高质量系统评价的RAG语料库配置表现最佳。

Conclusion: 对于新兴疾病，基于精选二次评价的检索能平衡单一共识文件和未筛选原始文献，提出Guide - RAG系统和评估框架辅助临床决策。

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

### [31] [Extending Temporal Disturbance Estimations For Magnetic Anomaly Navigation and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15113)
*Anutam Srinivasan,Aaron Nielsen*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 为解决磁异常测绘中长距离航磁测量难题，开发ERSM模型并评估不同回归模型性能，还考虑多因素对模型影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定地面站测量和去除地磁干扰场在长距离航磁测量中不实际，需新方法。

Method: 开发扩展参考站模型（ERSM），应用纵向校正和回归模型，采用线性回归、k近邻回归和神经网络回归模型评估性能。

Result: kNN和神经网络模型在较远距离典型均方根误差低于10nT、中值误差低于5nT，线性回归模型在近距离站点误差低于5nT。

Conclusion: ERSM可用于解决长距离航磁测量问题，不同回归模型有不同性能表现，ERS选择受多种因素影响。

Abstract: Slow-moving vehicles relying on crustal magnetic anomaly navigation (MagNav)
or vehicles revisiting the same location in a short time - such as those used
for surveys in magnetic anomaly mapping - require fixed ground stations within
100 km of the vehicle's trajectory to measure and remove the geomagnetic
disturbance field from magnetic readings. This approach is impractical due to
the limited network of fixed-ground magnetometer stations, making long-range
(several hundred kilometers long) aeromagnetic surveys for anomaly map-making
infeasible. To address these challenges, we developed the Extended Reference
Station Model (ERSM). ERSM applies a longitudinal correction and regression
model to an extended reference ground magnetometer station (ERS) to produce an
estimate of the local temporal disturbance field. ERSM is regression
model-agnostic, so we implemented a linear regression, a k-nearest neighbors
(kNN) regression, and a neural-network regression model to assess performance
benefits. Our results show typical performance below 10nT root mean square
error and median performance below 5nT for typical use with the kNN and
neural-net model for farther distances and below 5nT performance using the
linear regression model on stations with proximity. We also consider how
space-weather events, water-body separation, and proximity to polar regions
affect the model performance based on ERS selection.

Method: 提出含风险中性漂移的对数跳跃扩散模型，构建校准流程，定义衍生层。

Result: 在合成风险中性路径和真实事件数据实验中，模型降低了短期信念方差预测误差。

Conclusion: 对数跳跃扩散核为预测市场提供类似隐含波动率的工具，便于报价、对冲和转移信念风险。

Abstract: Prediction markets, such as Polymarket, aggregate dispersed information into
tradable probabilities, but they still lack a unifying stochastic kernel
comparable to the one options gained from Black-Scholes. As these markets scale
with institutional participation, exchange integrations, and higher volumes
around elections and macro prints, market makers face belief volatility, jump,
and cross-event risks without standardized tools for quoting or hedging. We
propose such a foundation: a logit jump-diffusion with risk-neutral drift that
treats the traded probability p_t as a Q-martingale and exposes belief
volatility, jump intensity, and dependence as quotable risk factors. On top, we
build a calibration pipeline that filters microstructure noise, separates
diffusion from jumps using expectation-maximization, enforces the risk-neutral
drift, and yields a stable belief-volatility surface. We then define a coherent
derivative layer (variance, correlation, corridor, and first-passage
instruments) analogous to volatility and correlation products in option
markets. In controlled experiments on synthetic risk-neutral paths and real
event data, the model reduces short-horizon belief-variance forecast error
relative to diffusion-only and probability-space baselines, supporting both
causal calibration and economic interpretability. Conceptually, the logit
jump-diffusion kernel supplies an implied-volatility analogue for prediction
markets: a tractable, tradable language for quoting, hedging, and transferring
belief risk across venues such as Polymarket.

a modular workflow comprising seven stages: underlying infrastructure, market
topic, share structure and pricing, trading, market resolution, settlement, and
archiving. For each module, we enumerate the design variants, analyzing
trade-offs around decentralization, expressiveness, and manipulation
resistance. We also identify open problems for researchers interested in this

Motivation: 现有多表连接查询估计方法存在空间开销大、延迟高和复杂度大等问题，且属性独立假设会导致多表连接查询高估。

Method: 提出TKHist方法放松直方图均匀性假设以进行无过滤谓词的连接查询基数估计；提出主导连接路径关联发现算法处理连接键和过滤谓词的关联。

Result: 在流行基准测试上，TKHist比SOTA方法降低2 - 3个数量级的误差方差，内存使用相当或更低。

Conclusion: TKHist方法能有效解决现有基数估计方法的问题，提高估计准确性并控制内存使用。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation has long been crucial for cost-based database
optimizers in identifying optimal query execution plans, attracting significant
attention over the past decades. While recent advancements have significantly
improved the accuracy of multi-table join query estimations, these methods
introduce challenges such as higher space overhead, increased latency, and
greater complexity, especially when integrated with the binary join framework.
In this paper, we introduce a novel cardinality estimation method named TKHist,
which addresses these challenges by relaxing the uniformity assumption in
histograms. TKHist captures bin-wise non-uniformity information, enabling
accurate cardinality estimation for join queries without filter predicates.
Furthermore, we explore the attribute independent assumption, which can lead to
significant over-estimation rather than under-estimation in multi-table join
queries. To address this issue, we propose the dominating join path correlation
discovery algorithm to highlight and manage correlations between join keys and
filter predicates. Our extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate
that TKHist reduces error variance by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to SOTA
methods, while maintaining comparable or lower memory usage.

Motivation: 云数据湖架构中数据从存储层传输到计算层进行查询会影响计算性能并需大量网络带宽，需提升查询性能。

Method: 形式化问题，提出包含“查询覆盖集”概念的理论框架，确定每个查询的最小覆盖集并仅在该子集文件上执行查询。

Result: 能够显著提高查询性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略可有效提升云数据湖架构中的查询性能。

Abstract: Cloud data lakes provide a modern solution for managing large volumes of
data. The fundamental principle behind these systems is the separation of
compute and storage layers. In this architecture, inexpensive cloud storage is
utilized for data storage, while compute engines are employed to perform
analytics on this data in an "on-demand" mode. However, to execute any
calculations on the data, it must be transferred from the storage layer to the
compute layer over the network for each query. This transfer can negatively
impact calculation performance and requires significant network bandwidth. In
this thesis, we examine various strategies to enhance query performance within
a cloud data lake architecture. We begin by formalizing the problem and
proposing a straightforward yet robust theoretical framework that clearly
outlines the associated trade-offs. Central to our framework is the concept of
a "query coverage set," which is defined as the collection of files that need
to be accessed from storage to fulfill a specific query. Our objective is to
identify the minimal coverage set for each query and execute the query
exclusively on this subset of files. This approach enables us to significantly
improve query performance.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出Hive哈希表，有缓存对齐布局、同步协议和动态调整策略，实验显示其性能优于现有GPU哈希表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU哈希表在并发更新、高负载因子和不规则内存访问模式方面存在问题。

Method: 采用缓存对齐打包桶布局、warp同步并发协议、负载因子感知动态调整策略及四步插入策略。

Result: 在NVIDIA RTX 4090实验中，负载因子达95%，混合工作负载下吞吐量比现有表高1.5 - 2倍，平衡工作负载下更新和查找速度快。

Conclusion: Hive哈希表具有可扩展性和效率，适用于GPU加速数据处理。

Abstract: Hash tables are essential building blocks in data-intensive applications, yet
existing GPU implementations often struggle with concurrent updates, high load
factors, and irregular memory access patterns. We present Hive hash table, a
high-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table
that adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.
  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed
bucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory
access and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous
concurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and
Warp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic
operation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a
load-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in
warp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced
occupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs
a four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and
overflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded
recovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while
eliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.
  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains
load factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than
state-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed
insert-delete-lookup workloads. On balanced workload, Hive hash table reaches
3.5 billion updates/s and nearly 4 billion lookups/s, demonstrating scalability
and efficiency for GPU-accelerated data processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前区块链执行层成为性能瓶颈，现有并行执行框架在高竞争工作负载下性能下降。

Method: 提出NEMO执行引擎，包含贪婪提交规则、优化依赖处理、使用读写提示和基于优先级的调度器。

Result: 通过模拟执行实验，NEMO显著减少冗余计算，16个工作线程时，吞吐量比Block - STM高42%，比悲观并发控制基线高61%。

Conclusion: NEMO能有效应对区块链执行层在高竞争下的性能问题，比现有代表方法有更好的表现。

Abstract: Following the design of more efficient blockchain consensus algorithms, the
execution layer has emerged as the new performance bottleneck of blockchains,
especially under high contention. Current parallel execution frameworks either
rely on optimistic concurrency control (OCC) or on pessimistic concurrency
control (PCC), both of which see their performance decrease when workloads are
highly contended, albeit for different reasons. In this work, we present NEMO,
a new blockchain execution engine that combines OCC with the object data model
to address this challenge. NEMO introduces four core innovations: (i) a greedy
commit rule for transactions using only owned objects; (ii) refined handling of
dependencies to reduce re-executions; (iii) the use of incomplete but
statically derivable read/write hints to guide execution; and (iv) a
priority-based scheduler that favors transactions that unblock others. Through
simulated execution experiments, we demonstrate that NEMO significantly reduces
redundant computation and achieves higher throughput than representative
approaches. For example, with 16 workers NEMO's throughput is up to 42% higher
than the one of Block-STM, the state-of-the-art OCC approach, and 61% higher
than the pessimistic concurrency control baseline used.

Method: 提出Kubernetes操作符运行Charm++应用，设计基于优先级的弹性作业调度器根据Kubernetes集群状态动态调整作业规模。

Result: 弹性调度器能以最小开销调整HPC作业规模，相比传统静态调度器有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的弹性调度器在高效利用云资源、提升性能方面有积极效果。

Abstract: The last few years have seen an increase in adoption of the cloud for running
HPC applications. The pay-as-you-go cost model of these cloud resources has
necessitated the development of specialized programming models and schedulers
for HPC jobs for efficient utilization of cloud resources. A key aspect of
efficient utilization is the ability to rescale applications on the fly to
maximize the utilization of cloud resources. Most commonly used parallel
programming models like MPI have traditionally not supported autoscaling either
in a cloud environment or on supercomputers. While more recent work has been
done to implement this functionality in MPI, it is still nascent and requires
additional programmer effort. Charm++ is a parallel programming model that
natively supports dynamic rescaling through its migratable objects paradigm. In
this paper, we present a Kubernetes operator to run Charm++ applications on a
Kubernetes cluster. We then present a priority-based elastic job scheduler that
can dynamically rescale jobs based on the state of a Kubernetes cluster to
maximize cluster utilization while minimizing response time for high-priority
jobs. We show that our elastic scheduler, with the ability to rescale HPC jobs
with minimal overhead, demonstrates significant performance improvements over
traditional static schedulers.

Motivation: 克服传统模型在捕捉复杂依赖和动态特征方面的局限性，解决分布式后端系统的流量预测问题。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高分布式后端系统流量预测的准确性和鲁棒性，验证了图神经网络在复杂系统建模中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of traffic prediction in distributed backend
systems and proposes a graph neural network based modeling approach to overcome
the limitations of traditional models in capturing complex dependencies and
dynamic features. The system is abstracted as a graph with nodes and edges,
where node features represent traffic and resource states, and adjacency
relations describe service interactions. A graph convolution mechanism enables
multi order propagation and aggregation of node features, while a gated
recurrent structure models historical sequences dynamically, thus integrating
spatial structures with temporal evolution. A spatiotemporal joint modeling
module further fuses graph representation with temporal dependency, and a
decoder generates future traffic predictions. The model is trained with mean
squared error to minimize deviations from actual values. Experiments based on
public distributed system logs construct combined inputs of node features,
topology, and sequences, and compare the proposed method with mainstream
baselines using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results show that the proposed method
achieves stable performance and low error across different prediction horizons
and model depths, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of
traffic forecasting in distributed backend systems and verifying the potential
of graph neural networks in complex system modeling.

Motivation: Spark内置调度器难兼顾用户公平性和低平均响应时间，现有方案侧重作业公平性有缺陷，内置公平调度器缺乏适应性。

Method: 提出UWFQ调度器，模拟虚拟公平排队系统，基于有界公平模型按估计完成时间调度作业；引入运行时分区方法动态细化任务粒度。

Result: 使用多用户合成工作负载和谷歌集群跟踪评估，UWFQ相比现有Spark内置调度器和先进公平调度算法，小作业平均响应时间最多降低74%。

Conclusion: UWFQ调度器能有效减少作业响应时间，实现用户间公平资源分配。

Abstract: Apache Spark is a widely adopted framework for large-scale data processing.
However, in industrial analytics environments, Spark's built-in schedulers,
such as FIFO and fair scheduling, struggle to maintain both user-level fairness
and low mean response time, particularly in long-running shared applications.
Existing solutions typically focus on job-level fairness which unintentionally
favors users who submit more jobs. Although Spark offers a built-in fair
scheduler, it lacks adaptability to dynamic user workloads and may degrade
overall job performance. We present the User Weighted Fair Queuing (UWFQ)
scheduler, designed to minimize job response times while ensuring equitable
resource distribution across users and their respective jobs. UWFQ simulates a
virtual fair queuing system and schedules jobs based on their estimated finish
times under a bounded fairness model. To further address task skew and reduce
priority inversions, which are common in Spark workloads, we introduce runtime
partitioning, a method that dynamically refines task granularity based on
expected runtime. We implement UWFQ within the Spark framework and evaluate its
performance using multi-user synthetic workloads and Google cluster traces. We
show that UWFQ reduces the average response time of small jobs by up to 74%
compared to existing built-in Spark schedulers and to state-of-the-art fair
scheduling algorithms.

Result: 在H100 GPU真实测试台上，beLLMan使推理延迟最高降低8倍，在拥塞期间降低25%能耗，同时多处理19%请求

Conclusion: beLLMan能有效控制推理延迟、降低能耗，提高系统处理请求能力

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications are blindfolded to the infrastructure
underneath and generate tokens autoregressively, indifferent to the system
load, thus risking inferencing latency inflation and poor user experience. Our
first-cut controller, named beLLMan, enables the LLM infrastructure to actively
and progressively signal the first-party LLM application to adjust the output
length in response to changing system load. On a real testbed with H100 GPUs,
beLLMan helps keep inferencing latency under control (upto 8X lower end-to-end
latency) and reduces energy consumption by 25% (while serving 19% more
requests) during periods of congestion for a summarization workload.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of embedded systems, along with the growing variety and
complexity of AI algorithms, necessitates a powerful hardware/software
co-design methodology based on virtual prototyping technologies. The market
offers a diverse range of simulation solutions, each with its unique
technological approach and therefore strengths and weaknesses. Additionally,
with the increasing availability of remote on-demand computing resources and
their adaptation throughout the industry, the choice of the host infrastructure
for execution opens even more new possibilities for operational strategies.
This work explores the dichotomy between local and cloud-based simulation
environments, focusing on the trade-offs between scalability and privacy. We
discuss how the setup of the compute infrastructure impacts the performance of
the execution and security of data involved in the process. Furthermore, we
highlight the development workflow associated with embedded AI and the critical
role of efficient simulations in optimizing these algorithms. With the proposed
solution, we aim to sustainably improve trust in remote simulations and
facilitate the adoption of virtual prototyping practices.

Abstract: We consider discrete, iterative load balancing via matchings on arbitrary
graphs. Initially each node holds a certain number of tokens, defining the load
of the node, and the objective is to redistribute the tokens such that
eventually each node has approximately the same number of tokens. We present
results for a general class of simple local balancing schemes where the tokens
are balanced via matchings. In each round the process averages the tokens of
any two matched nodes. If the sum of their tokens is odd, the node to receive
the one excess token is selected at random. Our class covers three popular
models: in the matching model a new matching is generated randomly in each
round, in the balancing circuit model a fixed sequence of matchings is applied
periodically, and in the asynchronous model the load is balanced over a
randomly chosen edge.
  We measure the quality of a load vector by its discrepancy, defined as the
difference between the maximum and minimum load across all nodes. As our main
result we show that with high probability our discrete balancing scheme reaches
a discrepancy of $3$ in a number of rounds which asymptotically matches the
spectral bound for continuous load balancing with fractional load.
  This result improves and tightens a long line of previous works, by not only
achieving a small constant discrepancy (instead of a non-explicit, large
constant) but also holding for arbitrary instead of regular graphs. The result
also demonstrates that in the general model we consider, discrete load
balancing is no harder than continuous load balancing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代分布式系统中构建准确服务依赖图受复杂路由技术（如NAT）阻碍，现有运行时方法无法准确推断服务依赖，因此需要新系统。

Method: XXXX通过在TCP数据包头部注入元数据的非破坏性方法，在跨主机边界时保持协议正确性。

Result: 在九个场景中与三个最先进系统对比评估，XXXX是唯一在各种网络配置下表现一致的方法，多数场景下精确率和召回率达100%。

Conclusion: XXXX能有效构建进程级服务依赖图，在复杂网络路由机制下表现良好，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Modern distributed systems rely on complex networks of interconnected
services, creating direct or indirect dependencies that can propagate faults
and cause cascading failures. To localize the root cause of performance
degradation in these environments, constructing a service dependency graph is
highly beneficial. However, building an accurate service dependency graph is
impaired by complex routing techniques, such as Network Address Translation
(NAT), an essential mechanism for connecting services across networks. NAT
obfuscates the actual hosts running the services, causing existing run-time
approaches that passively observe network metadata to fail in accurately
inferring service dependencies. To this end, this paper introduces XXXX, a
novel run-time system for constructing process-level service dependency graphs.
It operates without source code instrumentation and remains resilient under
complex network routing mechanisms, including NAT. XXXX implements a
non-disruptive method of injecting metadata onto a TCP packet's header that
maintains protocol correctness across host boundaries. In other words, if no
receiving agent is present, the instrumentation leaves existing TCP connections
unaffected, ensuring non-disruptive operation when it is partially deployed
across hosts. We evaluated XXXX extensively against three state-of-the-art
systems across nine scenarios, involving three network configurations
(NAT-free, internal-NAT, external-NAT) and three microservice benchmarks. XXXX
was the only approach that performed consistently across networking
configurations. With regards to correctness, it performed on par with, or
better than, the state-of-the-art with precision and recall values of 100% in
the majority of the scenarios.

Motivation: 大规模GPU训练中，训练过程受干扰、动态运行时变化频繁影响训练效率，需理解可变性原因并解决。

Method: 分析GPU微基准测试，提出考虑随机特性的PRISM性能建模框架，用统计方法量化训练时间概率保证。

Conclusion: PRISM框架能有效应对大规模分布式训练的性能可变性问题，为训练设计和优化提供帮助。

Abstract: Large model training beyond tens of thousands of GPUs is an uncharted
territory. At such scales, disruptions to the training process are not a matter
of if, but a matter of when -- a stochastic process degrading training
productivity. Dynamic runtime variation will become increasingly more frequent
as training scales up and GPUs are operated in increasingly power-limited and
thermally-stressed environments. At the 64k GPU scale, we already observed 9%
GPU time variability for frontier foundation model training. To understand
potential causes of variability, we analyze GPU microbenchmarks at scale across
a variety of platforms, showing up to 14% variation in GPU performance on GEMM
workloads depending on training hardware and deployed environment.
  Motivated by our analysis and the large design space around performance
variability, we present PRISM -- a performance modeling framework that
considers the stochastic nature of the large-scale distributed training. The
core of PRISM is the statistical method that provides a quantifiable measure
for probabilistic guarantees on training time. Using PRISM, we explore the
design and optimization space of distributed training, from parallelization
methods to next-generation training systems. PRISM is validated with
real-system measurement, showing training time prediction accuracy with 20.8%
Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Using PRISM, we demonstrate that, depending on
computation node placement, up to 1.26x performance improvement potential is
available if we factor in sensitivities of parallelization strategies to
variation. In addition, we use PRISM to identify kernels to optimize for
reducing performance variability and predict probability of slow-down for
large-scale jobs where variation is magnified. We find optimizing communication
kernels, such as AllGather and ReduceScatter, contribute most to minimizing
variability in training step time.

Conclusion: 所提架构可有效解决异构集群中机器学习工作负载的资源分配问题，实现节能并满足性能要求。

Abstract: The growing demand for computational resources in machine learning has made
efficient resource allocation a critical challenge, especially in heterogeneous
hardware clusters where devices vary in capability, age, and energy efficiency.
Upgrading to the latest hardware is often infeasible, making sustainable use of
existing, mixed-generation resources essential. In this paper, we propose a
learning-based architecture for managing machine learning workloads in
heterogeneous clusters. The system operates online, allocating resources to
incoming training or inference requests while minimizing energy consumption and
meeting performance requirements. It uses two neural networks: the first
provides initial estimates of how well a new model will utilize different
hardware types and how it will affect co-located models. An optimizer then
allocates resources based on these estimates. After deployment, the system
monitors real performance and uses this data to refine its predictions via a
second neural network. This updated model improves estimates not only for the
current hardware but also for hardware not initially allocated and for
co-location scenarios not yet observed. The result is an adaptive, iterative
approach that learns over time to make more effective resource allocation
decisions in heterogeneous deep learning clusters.

Motivation: 研究分布式量子计算领域的 Lovász 局部引理（LLL）问题，解决近期提出的开放性问题。

Abstract: In this work, we study the Lov\'asz local lemma (LLL) problem in the area of
distributed quantum computing, which has been the focus of attention of recent
advances in quantum computing [STOC'24, STOC'25, STOC'25]. We prove a lower
bound of $2^{\Omega(\log^* n)}$ for the complexity of the distributed LLL in
the quantum-LOCAL model. More specifically, we obtain our lower bound already
for a very well-studied special case of the LLL, called sinkless orientation,
in a stronger model than quantum-LOCAL, called the randomized online-LOCAL
model. As a consequence, we obtain the same lower bounds for sinkless
orientation and the distributed LLL also in a variety of other models studied
across different research communities.
  Our work provides the first superconstant lower bound for sinkless
orientation and the distributed LLL in all of these models, addressing recently
stated open questions. Moreover, to obtain our results, we develop an entirely
new lower bound technique that we believe has the potential to become the first
generic technique for proving post-quantum lower bounds for many of the most
important problems studied in the context of locality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA在云原生环境应用受阻，编排器缺乏对FPGA虚拟化等支持，云提供商无相关编排服务，导致可扩展性等不足。

Method: 提出Funky编排引擎，包括FPGA虚拟化、状态管理和遵循行业标准的编排组件。

Result: 用4台x86服务器评估，能移植23个OpenCL应用，OCI镜像小28.7倍，性能开销7.4%，大规模集群评估展示可扩展性等。

Conclusion: Funky能为FPGA工作负载提供编排服务，实现高性能、可扩展性和容错性。

Abstract: The adoption of FPGAs in cloud-native environments is facing impediments due
to FPGA limitations and CPU-oriented design of orchestrators, as they lack
virtualization, isolation, and preemption support for FPGAs. Consequently,
cloud providers offer no orchestration services for FPGAs, leading to low
scalability, flexibility, and resiliency.
  This paper presents Funky, a full-stack FPGA-aware orchestration engine for
cloud-native applications. Funky offers primary orchestration services for FPGA
workloads to achieve high performance, utilization, scalability, and fault
tolerance, accomplished by three contributions: (1) FPGA virtualization for
lightweight sandboxes, (2) FPGA state management enabling task preemption and
checkpointing, and (3) FPGA-aware orchestration components following the
industry-standard CRI/OCI specifications.
  We implement and evaluate Funky using four x86 servers with Alveo U50 FPGA
cards. Our evaluation highlights that Funky allows us to port 23 OpenCL
applications from the Xilinx Vitis and Rosetta benchmark suites by modifying
3.4% of the source code while keeping the OCI image sizes 28.7 times smaller
than AMD's FPGA-accessible Docker containers. In addition, Funky incurs only
7.4% performance overheads compared to native execution, while providing
virtualization support with strong hypervisor-enforced isolation and
cloud-native orchestration for a set of distributed FPGAs. Lastly, we evaluate
Funky's orchestration services in a large-scale cluster using Google production
traces, showing its scalability, fault tolerance, and scheduling efficiency.

Motivation: 研究单机器在抢占撤销模型下的无权重吞吐量调度问题，对比抢占重启模型。

Method: 通过对抗构造建立下界，从三作业实例开始迭代嵌套构造。

Result: 对于任意 $k\ge 3$，存在实例使在线算法完成至多一个作业，最优算法完成至少 $k$ 个作业，竞争比可任意接近零。

Conclusion: 在抢占撤销模型下无确定性在线算法能达到常数竞争比，与抢占重启模型形成鲜明对比。

Abstract: We study the unweighted throughput scheduling problem on a single machine in
the preemption-revoke model, where a running job may be aborted at any time,
but all progress is permanently lost and the job cannot be restarted. Each job
$J_i=(r_i,p_i,s_i)$ is defined by a release time $r_i$, a processing time
$p_i$, and a slack $s_i$, and must start no later than $r_i+s_i$ to be
feasible. We prove that no deterministic online algorithm can achieve a
constant competitive ratio. The lower bound is established via an adversarial
construction: starting from a three-job instance where $\textsf{ALG}$ completes
at most one job while $\textsf{OPT}$ completes all three, we iteratively nest
such constructions. By induction, for every $k\ge 3$, there exists an instance
where $\textsf{ALG}$ completes at most one job, while $\textsf{OPT}$ completes
at least $k$ jobs. Thus, the competitive ratio can be forced to $1/k$, and
hence made arbitrarily close to zero. Our result stands in sharp contrast to
the preemption-restart model, where Hoogeveen, Potts, and Woeginger (2000) gave
a deterministic $1/2$-competitive algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的算法可解决分层连通性重配置问题，且最小化重配置序列长度问题具有较高复杂度。

Abstract: Network redesign problems ask to modify the edges of a given graph to satisfy
some properties. In temporal graphs, where edges are only active at certain
times, we are sometimes only allowed to modify when the edges are going to be
active. In practice, we might not even be able to perform all of the necessary
modifications at once; changes must be applied step-by-step while the network
is still in operation, meaning that the network must continue to satisfy some
properties. To initiate a study in this area, we introduce the temporal graph
reconfiguration problem. As a starting point, we consider the Layered
Connectivity Reconfiguration problem in which every snapshot of the temporal
graph must remain connected throughout the reconfiguration. We provide insights
into how bridges can be reconfigured into non-bridges based on their
reachability partitions, which lets us identify any edge as either changeable
or unchangeable. From this we construct a polynomial-time algorithm that gives
a valid reconfiguration sequence of length at most 2M^2 (where M is the number
of temporal edges), or determines that reconfiguration is not possible. We also
show that minimizing the length of the reconfiguration sequence is NP-hard via
a reduction from vertex cover.

Abstract: Contract theory studies how a principal can incentivize agents to exert
costly, unobservable effort through performance-based payments. While classical
economic models provide elegant characterizations of optimal solutions, modern
applications, ranging from online labor markets and healthcare to AI delegation
and blockchain protocols, call for an algorithmic perspective. The challenge is
no longer only which contracts induce desired behavior, but whether such
contracts can be computed efficiently. This viewpoint has given rise to
\emph{algorithmic contract design}, paralleling the rise of algorithmic
mechanism design two decades ago.
  This article focuses on \emph{combinatorial contracts}, an emerging frontier
within algorithmic contract design, where agents may choose among exponentially
many combinations of actions, or where multiple agents must work together as a
team, and the challenge lies in selecting the right composition. These models
capture a wide variety of real-world contracting environments, from hospitals
coordinating physicians across treatment protocols to firms hiring teams of
engineers for interdependent tasks. We review three combinatorial settings: (i)
a single agent choosing multiple actions, (ii) multiple agents with binary
actions, and (iii) multiple agents each selecting multiple actions. For each,
we highlight structural insights, algorithmic techniques, and complexity
barriers. Results include tractable cases such as gross substitutes reward
functions, hardness results, and approximation guarantees under value- and
demand-oracle access. By charting these advances, the article maps the emerging
landscape of combinatorial contract design, and highlights fundamental open
questions and promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 研究为手牌抽象提供统一形式处理和设计高分辨率抽象的实践指导。

Abstract: Hand abstraction is crucial for scaling imperfect-information games (IIGs)
such as Texas Hold'em, yet progress is limited by the lack of a formal task
model and by evaluations that require resource-intensive strategy solving. We
introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored
to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action
sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction.
Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic
upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using
the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms
suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we
formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and
prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this
limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates
historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality.
Experiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently
outperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a
unified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for
designing higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of selling large, proprietary data, we consider an
information pricing problem proposed by Bergemann et al. that involves a
decision-making buyer and a monopolistic seller. The seller has access to the
underlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various
actions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through
better decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the
seller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To
contend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the
buyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a
data product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of
statistical experiments.
  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time
polynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is
naturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm
which, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a
near-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We
then analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a)
it suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of
such experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c)
full surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition
holds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer.

Conclusion: 提出的方案和策略能有效解决跨异构拍卖渠道确定最优策略的问题，提升广告投放效果。

Abstract: The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic
through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was
historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC)
for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a
binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher
revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory
treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side,
advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to
QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to
bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For
automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining
optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse
advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target
return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes
two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal
bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic
traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost
alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across
heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed
framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and
large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over
existing methods.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，RC - TIM显著优于四个最先进的相关方法，平均效用提高达45.76%。

Conclusion: RC - TIM能使联邦学习系统更适应操作环境的不可预测变化，提供灵活动态激励。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence due to heightened concerns over
data privacy. Privacy restrictions limit the visibility for data consumers
(DCs) to accurately assess the capabilities and efforts of data owners (DOs).
Thus, for open collaborative FL markets to thrive, effective incentive
mechanisms are key as they can motivate data owners (DOs) to contribute to FL
tasks. Contract theory is a useful technique for developing FL incentive
mechanisms. Existing approaches generally assume that once the contract between
a DC and a DO is signed, it remains unchanged until the FL task is finished.
However, unforeseen circumstances might force a DO to be unable to fulfill the
current contract, resulting in inefficient utilization of DCs' budgets. To
address this limitation, we propose the Renegotiable Contract-Theoretic
Incentive Mechanism (RC-TIM) for FL. Unlike previous approaches, it adapts to
changes in DOs' behavior and budget constraints by supporting the renegotiation
of contracts, providing flexible and dynamic incentives. Under RC-TIM, an FL
system is more adaptive to unpredictable changes in the operating environment
that can affect the quality of the service provided by DOs. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RC-TIM significantly
outperforms four state-of-the-art related methods, delivering up to a 45.76%
increase in utility on average.

Abstract: Technologies such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) depend on the availability
of infrastructure. We define the Infrastructure Provider (InP) as the actor
responsible for deploying and maintaining this infrastructure, while Service
Providers (SPs) operate applications over it to serve end users and earn
revenues. Deploying such infrastructure requires however a significant
investment, and the InP may be reluctant to bear it alone. We propose
co-investment to overcome this barrier, allowing players, the InP and multiple
SPs, to share costs and revenues. However, committing to a co-investment over a
long period may be too constraining for players: in an unforeseeable future,
players may realize that they could make more profit outside the co-investment
(such a profit is called opportunity cost). For this reason, we propose a
scheme, based on coalitional game theory, which is dynamic in terms of
(i)allowing players to join, remain in, or leave the co-investment, (ii)
adjusting the infrastructure capacity and resource sharing over time. We
propose a method to compute entry fees and exit penalties in order to
appropriately compensate players remaining in the co-investment. We numerically
show that our dynamic scheme encourages player participation and increases
profit (in case of high opportunity cost).

Abstract: Direct reciprocity, typically studied using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
(IPD), is central to understanding how cooperation evolves. In the 1980s,
Robert Axelrod organized two influential IPD computer tournaments, where Tit
for Tat (TFT) emerged as the winner. Yet the archival record is incomplete: for
the first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted
Fortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises
questions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results.
We recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran
implementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python
interface that calls the original strategy functions without modification.
Using the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce
Axelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be
cooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings
remain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally
submitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of
the largest IPD tournaments to date. We find that the original tournament was
especially favorable to TFT and that it is difficult to dethrone TFT when the
original submissions make up the majority of the field. We also observe that
several lesser-known submissions perform strongly in more diverse settings and
under noise. Our contributions are: (i) the first systematic reproduction of
Axelrod's second tournament; (ii) a contemporary reassessment of the original
results in light of new strategies and settings; and (iii) a preserved,
easy-to-use implementation of the second-tournament strategies within
Axelrod-Python to support future research.

TL;DR: 本文将逆博弈理论扩展到主动逆方法，用于有界理性的Stackelberg博弈，开发了主动学习和主动逆博弈方法并证明相关性质，通过仿真验证方法特性，表明主动逆博弈方法能更快达到Stackelberg均衡。

Motivation: 现有逆博弈理论方法未将学习者作为游戏的主动参与者，而这可显著增强学习过程，因此要将逆博弈理论扩展到主动逆方法。

Method: 开发利用Fisher信息最大化未知参数信息增益的主动学习方法；开发平衡探索与利用的主动逆博弈方法；在二次成本函数下证明方法的一致性、渐近正态性和渐近Stackelberg均衡。

Result: 通过二次情况的仿真验证了方法的性质，主动逆博弈方法能通过主动探索更快达到Stackelberg均衡。

Conclusion: 主动逆方法能有效应用于有界理性的Stackelberg博弈，主动逆博弈方法在达到Stackelberg均衡方面有优势。

Abstract: Inverse game theory is utilized to infer the cost functions of all players
based on game outcomes. However, existing inverse game theory methods do not
consider the learner as an active participant in the game, which could
significantly enhance the learning process. In this paper, we extend inverse
game theory to active inverse methods. For Stackelberg games with bounded
rationality, the leader, acting as a learner, actively chooses actions to
better understand the follower's cost functions. First, we develop a method of
active learning by leveraging Fisher information to maximize information gain
about the unknown parameters and prove the consistency and asymptotic
normality. Additionally, when leaders consider its cost, we develop a method of
active inverse game to balance exploration and exploitation, and prove the
consistency and asymptotic Stackelberg equilibrium with quadratic cost
functions. Finally, we verify the properties of these methods through
simulations in the quadratic case and demonstrate that the active inverse game
method can achieve Stackelberg equilibrium more quickly through active
exploration.

TL;DR: 提出针对灾难管理领域的密集检索模型DMRetriever，经三阶段框架训练，性能佳且参数高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用检索模型无法处理灾难管理场景的多样化搜索意图，缺乏针对该领域的检索模型。

Method: 通过双向注意力适应、无监督对比预训练和难度感知渐进式指令微调的三阶段框架，使用高级数据细化管道生成的高质量数据进行训练。

Result: DMRetriever在各模型规模的六种搜索意图上均达到了SOTA性能，且参数效率高。

Conclusion: DMRetriever是适合灾难管理领域的有效检索模型，代码等资源开源。

Abstract: Effective and efficient access to relevant information is essential for
disaster management. However, no retrieval model is specialized for disaster
management, and existing general-domain models fail to handle the varied search
intents inherent to disaster management scenarios, resulting in inconsistent
and unreliable performance. To this end, we introduce DMRetriever, the first
series of dense retrieval models (33M to 7.6B) tailored for this domain. It is
trained through a novel three-stage framework of bidirectional attention
adaptation, unsupervised contrastive pre-training, and difficulty-aware
progressive instruction fine-tuning, using high-quality data generated through
an advanced data refinement pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DMRetriever achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all six
search intents at every model scale. Moreover, DMRetriever is highly
parameter-efficient, with 596M model outperforming baselines over 13.3 X larger
and 33M model exceeding baselines with only 7.6% of their parameters. All

TL;DR: 提出MTmixAtt解决推荐系统传统管道问题，实验表明其优于基线模型，在线测试有积极效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统管道依赖手动特征工程和特定场景架构，阻碍跨场景迁移和大规模部署。

Method: 提出MTmixAtt，包含AutoToken模块自动聚类特征，MTmixAttBlock模块实现高效令牌交互。

Result: 在工业TRec数据集上优于多个基线模型，在线A/B测试中提升支付PV和实际支付GTV。

Conclusion: MTmixAtt为跨场景特征建模提供统一可扩展方案，提升用户体验和商业成果。

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems critically depend on high-quality ranking
models. However, traditional pipelines still rely on manual feature engineering
and scenario-specific architectures, which hinder cross-scenario transfer and
large-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with
Multi-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt
integrates two key components. The \textbf{AutoToken} module automatically
clusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the
need for human-defined feature groups. The \textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module
enables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense
experts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and
scenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on
the industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models,
WuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales,
MTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields
further monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world
impact: in the \textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by
\textbf{+3.62\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \textbf{+2.54\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt
provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous
features across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and
commercial outcomes.

Motivation: 现有工业级推荐系统检索阶段方案存在表达能力有限、难以融入动态用户偏好、构建和维护成本高等问题。

Method: 提出GRank，包含目标感知生成器、轻量级排序器和端到端多任务学习框架。

Result: 在两个公开基准和十亿级生产语料上实验，GRank提升Recall@500超30%，P99 QPS达现有检索器1.7倍；线上A/B测试核心参与指标显著提升。

Conclusion: GRank有效解决现有检索方案问题，可用于实际推荐系统并提升性能。

Abstract: Industrial-scale recommender systems rely on a cascade pipeline in which the
retrieval stage must return a high-recall candidate set from billions of items
under tight latency. Existing solutions ei- ther (i) suffer from limited
expressiveness in capturing fine-grained user-item interactions, as seen in
decoupled dual-tower architectures that rely on separate encoders, or
generative models that lack precise target-aware matching capabilities, or (ii)
build structured indices (tree, graph, quantization) whose item-centric
topologies struggle to incorporate dynamic user preferences and incur
prohibitive construction and maintenance costs.
  We present GRank, a novel structured-index-free retrieval paradigm that
seamlessly unifies target-aware learning with user-centric retrieval. Our key
innovations include: (1) A target-aware Generator trained to perform
personalized candidate generation via GPU-accelerated MIPS, eliminating
semantic drift and maintenance costs of structured indexing; (2) A lightweight
but powerful Ranker that performs fine-grained, candidate-specific inference on
small subsets; (3) An end-to-end multi-task learning framework that ensures
semantic consistency between generation and ranking objectives.
  Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and a billion-item production
corpus demonstrate that GRank improves Recall@500 by over 30% and 1.7$\times$
the P99 QPS of state-of-the-art tree- and graph-based retrievers.
  GRank has been fully deployed in production in our recommendation platform
since Q2 2025, serving 400 million active users with 99.95% service
availability. Online A/B tests confirm significant improvements in core
engagement metrics, with Total App Usage Time increasing by 0.160% in the main
app and 0.165% in the Lite version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统和社交媒体平台中，大规模基于ID的特征嵌入表耗内存大，管理嵌入大小有挑战，导致模型部署和维护困难。

Method: 定义自定义Keras层（维度掩码层），置于嵌入查找后，仅允许前N个维度通过以修剪嵌入向量。

Result: 离线实验和在线A/B测试表明，使用维度掩码层可使有效嵌入维度缩小40 - 50%，显著提升内存效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理大量ID特征的平台提供可扩展解决方案，优化资源使用和模型性能。

Abstract: In modern recommendation systems and social media platforms like Meta,
TikTok, and Instagram, large-scale ID-based features often require embedding
tables that consume significant memory. Managing these embedding sizes can be
challenging, leading to bulky models that are harder to deploy and maintain. In
this paper, we introduce a method to automatically determine the optimal
embedding size for ID features, significantly reducing the model size while
maintaining performance.
  Our approach involves defining a custom Keras layer called the dimension mask
layer, which sits directly after the embedding lookup. This layer trims the
embedding vector by allowing only the first N dimensions to pass through. By
doing this, we can reduce the input feature dimension by more than half with
minimal or no loss in model performance metrics. This reduction helps cut down
the memory footprint of the model and lowers the risk of overfitting due to
multicollinearity.
  Through offline experiments on public datasets and an online A/B test on a
real production dataset, we demonstrate that using a dimension mask layer can
shrink the effective embedding dimension by 40-50\%, leading to substantial
improvements in memory efficiency. This method provides a scalable solution for
platforms dealing with a high volume of ID features, optimizing both resource
usage and model performance.

Motivation: 自动化生产线故障原因识别有挑战，现有FMEA知识重用性有限，不同生产线FMEA工作表重用受自然语言、术语和流程差异阻碍。

Method: 提出过程感知框架，先通过本体引导大语言模型将FMEA工作表转化为统一知识图，再用带过程感知评分函数的RGCN学习嵌入，最后用链接预测推断和排序候选故障原因。

Result: 汽车压力传感器装配线案例中，该方法在故障原因识别上F1@20值达0.523，优于基线和RGCN方法，消融研究证实各部分贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高FMEA知识跨异构生产线的可转移性，支持更可靠故障诊断，为智能制造中领域自适应大语言模型应用铺路。

Abstract: Fault cause identification in automated manufacturing lines is challenging
due to the system's complexity, frequent reconfigurations, and the limited
reusability of existing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) knowledge.
Although FMEA worksheets contain valuable expert insights, their reuse across
heterogeneous lines is hindered by natural language variability, inconsistent
terminology, and process differences. To address these limitations, this study
proposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining
manufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)
reasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are
transformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large
language model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,
states, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional
Network (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that
respect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link
prediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with
the target line's process flow.
  A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400),
achieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification. Ablation
studies confirm the contributions of both LLM-driven domain conceptualization
and process-aware learning. These results indicate that the proposed framework
significantly improves the transferability of FMEA knowledge across
heterogeneous lines, thereby supporting operators in diagnosing failures more
reliably and paving the way for future domain-adaptive LLM applications in
smart manufacturing.

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验验证了Critic - LLM - RS的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的Critic - LLM - RS能有效提升大语言模型在推荐系统中的应用效果。

Abstract: As powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been leveraged for crafting recommendations to achieve precise
alignment with user preferences and elevate the quality of the recommendations.
The existing approaches implement both non-tuning and tuning strategies.
Compared to following the tuning strategy, the approaches following the
non-tuning strategy avoid the relatively costly, time-consuming, and
expertise-requiring process of further training pre-trained LLMs on
task-specific datasets, but they suffer the issue of not having the
task-specific business or local enterprise knowledge. To the best of our
knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy
explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful
recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing
critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS). For our purpose,
we train a separate machine-learning model called Critic that implements
collaborative filtering for recommendations by learning from the interactions
between many users and items. The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to
significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified
the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.

Abstract: We present SQuAI (https://squai.scads.ai/), a scalable and trustworthy
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for scientific
question answering (QA) with large language models (LLMs). SQuAI addresses key
limitations of existing RAG systems in the scholarly domain, where complex,
open-domain questions demand accurate answers, explicit claims with citations,
and retrieval across millions of scientific documents. Built on over 2.3
million full-text papers from arXiv.org, SQuAI employs four collaborative
agents to decompose complex questions into sub-questions, retrieve targeted
evidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to
improve contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI
integrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting
sentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer
relevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG
baseline. We further release a benchmark of 1,000 scientific
question-answer-evidence triplets to support reproducibility. With transparent
reasoning, verifiable citations, and domain-wide scalability, SQuAI
demonstrates how multi-agent RAG enables more trustworthy scientific QA with
LLMs.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的密集检索模型（DRMs）泛化能力差，此前结合MoE框架虽有效但增加大量额外参数。

Method: 提出在最终Transformer层后引入单个MoE块（SB - MoE）的设计，通过两种评估设置在多个IR任务上进行实验，并分析超参数对模型性能的影响。

Result: SB - MoE对轻量级DRMs如TinyBERT和BERT - Small效果好，始终优于标准模型微调；对参数更多的DRMs如BERT - Base和Contriever，需更多训练样本提升性能。

Conclusion: SB - MoE是一种更有效的设计，不同规模的DRMs使用时表现有差异。

Abstract: Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs) are a prominent development in Information
Retrieval (IR). A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is
that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains
they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR
incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer
layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of
additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which
introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To
assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical
evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation
setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot
generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different
underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective
test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform
zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform
further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters
(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this
variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE
is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as
TinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning
across benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and
Contriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve
improved retrieval performance. Our code is available online at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning and text generation
capabilities, prompting their use in scientific literature analysis, including
novelty assessment. While evaluating novelty of scientific papers is crucial
for peer review, it requires extensive knowledge of related work, something not
all reviewers have. While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature
analysis supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited
transparency and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information
retrieval module. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{GraphMind}$, an
easy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the
novelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\textbf{GraphMind}$
enables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore
related ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing

Result: 在三个真实推荐数据集上提升了基准模型性能，可解释性研究证实描述符的可解释性。

Conclusion: 模型无关的 FACE 框架无需微调 LLM 实现语义对齐，利用其预训练能力提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for integration
with collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems, which are
crucial for personalizing user experiences. However, a key challenge is that
LLMs struggle to interpret the latent, non-semantic embeddings produced by CF
approaches, limiting recommendation effectiveness and further applications. To
address this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF
embeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a
disentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific
vectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings
into LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment
objective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.
Hence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without
fine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their
pre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation
datasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with
interpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.

Motivation: 现有事实核查方法成本效益低，未充分利用验证模型内部知识，未复制人类搜索策略的迭代推理过程。

Method: 提出FIRE框架，以迭代方式集成证据检索和声明验证，用统一机制根据当前判断的置信度决定是否给出最终答案或生成后续搜索查询。

Result: 与其他框架相比，FIRE性能略好，平均降低大语言模型成本7.6倍，搜索成本16.5倍。

Conclusion: FIRE在大规模事实核查操作中有应用前景，代码开源。

Abstract: Fact-checking long-form text is challenging, and it is therefore common
practice to break it down into multiple atomic claims. The typical approach to
fact-checking these atomic claims involves retrieving a fixed number of pieces
of evidence, followed by a verification step. However, this method is usually
not cost-effective, as it underutilizes the verification model's internal
knowledge of the claim and fails to replicate the iterative reasoning process
in human search strategies. To address these limitations, we propose FIRE, a
novel agent-based framework that integrates evidence retrieval and claim
verification in an iterative manner. Specifically, FIRE employs a unified
mechanism to decide whether to provide a final answer or generate a subsequent
search query, based on its confidence in the current judgment. We compare FIRE
with other strong fact-checking frameworks and find that it achieves slightly
better performance while reducing large language model (LLM) costs by an
average of 7.6 times and search costs by 16.5 times. These results indicate
that FIRE holds promise for application in large-scale fact-checking
operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/fire.git.

resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer在时间序列数据中保留时间关系的能力，且简单线性模型在TSF任务中可能表现更好，需开发更优模型。

Method: 提出Gaussian-activated Linear model (GLinear)架构，利用周期性模式进行多变量时间序列预测，并在四个数据集上评估。

Result: GLinear在多数多变量TSF情况下优于现有架构，数据效率高。

Conclusion: GLinear模型为高效时间序列分析的架构研发开辟新方向。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields.
There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at
understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships
in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might
outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex
Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel
data-efficient architecture, \textit{Gaussian-activated Linear model
(GLinear)}, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide
better accuracy. It achieves higher prediction accuracy while requiring less
historical data than other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different
datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the
performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with
state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear)
and transformer-based time series predictors (Autoformer) shows that the
GLinear, despite being data efficient, outperforms the existing architectures
in most cases of multivariate TSF while being competitive in others. We hope
that the proposed GLinear model opens new fronts of research and development of
simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally
efficient time-series analysis. The source code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: TangledFeatures框架比传统选择技术更具可解释性和稳定性，可用于下游模型分析。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

Motivation: 传统C51算法在状态下多个动作期望奖励相似但分布不同时，可能无法学习到稳定分布。

Method: 提出ES - C51，用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q - learning更新；将标准C51探索策略从e - greedy改为softmax得到QL - C51用于对比。

Result: ES - C51在Gym经典控制环境和Atari - 10游戏中表现优于QL - C51。

Conclusion: ES - C51能减少动作期望奖励相似时的不稳定性，使智能体学习到更高性能策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Conclusion: 该方法可实现预测性维护，减少风机故障，提高大规模风能部署的运营效率，具有显著社会价值。

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Motivation: 现有基于最优传输（OT）的FGM训练方法在处理大型高维数据集时可扩展性受限，需要改进。

Method: 引入AlignFlow，利用SDOT在噪声分布和数据点之间建立显式、最优对齐，通过将噪声空间划分为拉盖尔单元计算传输映射，在FGM训练中通过SDOT映射将噪声样本与数据点配对。

Result: AlignFlow能提升多种最先进的FGM算法性能，可作为即插即用组件。

Conclusion: AlignFlow是一种有效且可扩展的FGM训练方法，能显著提升FGM算法性能。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在OOD场景难将内部知识与环境动态结合，传统RL训练扩展性差，需改进决策能力。

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模两部分，提出SPA框架，先自博弈监督微调学习世界模型，再用于策略优化。

Result: SPA框架优于在线世界建模基线，大幅提升基于RL的智能体训练性能，如提升Sokoban和FrozenLake的成功率。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升大语言模型在不同环境中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Method: 引入MCTVMDP，上层MDP配置下层MDP的非平稳转移函数，同时优化上下层策略。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

Result: 部分slop模式在大语言模型输出中比人类文本出现频率高1000倍以上；Antislop Sampler成功抑制8000多种模式且保持质量；FTPO实现90%的slop减少，在跨领域评估中保持或提高性能；DPO虽有抑制效果但写作质量和词汇多样性下降。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效检测和消除大语言模型输出的重复表述，且在性能上优于DPO。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge

approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to

Conclusion: DLER及其改进方法能有效解决推理语言模型输出过长问题，在不同场景有应用价值。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究大离散支持上多峰重尾概率质量函数（PMF）的非参数估计，采用数据依赖低通滤波器，计算快且易调参，在多例中表现好但有已知失效模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对大离散支持上多峰重尾的概率质量函数进行非参数估计。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，应用数据依赖低通滤波器，构建对称三对角算子，计算特征向量，投影到低维子空间，再进行后处理得到有效PMF，还给出基于正交级数风险估计选择维度的规则。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾示例中，该方法能保留粗结构并抑制采样噪声，优于logspline和Gaussian - KDE基线，但有已知失效模式。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简单，跨样本大小稳健，因其可靠性和速度适用于自动化管道和大规模探索性分析。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Conclusion: 该研究为GTD事件预测提供了透明且优于基线的参考。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Conclusion: 所提理论及改进机制为特征学习提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Result: 通过三个例子证明了测地线问题适合用Deep Ritz方法。

Conclusion: 确定了Deep Ritz方法的一个有前景的应用，为未来科学机器学习研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Motivation: 常用髋部骨折风险评估工具如DXA T - score和FRAX灵敏度不足，漏诊高风险人群。

Method: 提出两阶段模型，第一阶段利用临床、人口统计学和功能变量估计基线风险，第二阶段结合DXA衍生特征进行细化，使用多个研究的数据，并进行内外部测试验证。

Result: 模型在各队列中表现稳定且具有适应性，与T - score和FRAX相比，灵敏度更高，漏诊病例减少。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架为早期髋部骨折风险评估提供了一种经济有效且个性化的方法。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Conclusion: 研究弥合了表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型遵循指令能力很重要，大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循指令同样关键，需评估此能力。

Method: 引入ReasonIF基准进行评估，探索多轮推理和推理指令微调两种提升策略。

Result: 开源模型推理指令遵循表现差，最高得分低于0.25，任务难度增加表现更差；推理指令微调使GPT - OSS - 20B得分从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 当前大型推理模型在推理指令遵循方面有很大提升空间。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

Conclusion: 模型推理潜力与预训练区分合理与不合理知识的能力相关，强调预训练对推理的重要性，提供选/设计基础模型的实用指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型在现实金融应用中因高风险和高利害性面临挑战，需要评估其在金融应用中的可信度。

Method: 引入专门的综合基准FinTrust，基于实际场景关注一系列对齐问题，并针对可信度评估的每个维度设置细粒度任务，对11个大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 专有模型如o4 - mini在多数任务（如安全性）上表现更好，开源模型如DeepSeek - V3在特定领域（如行业层面公平性）有优势；在信托对齐和披露等具有挑战性的任务上，所有大语言模型都表现不佳，显示出法律意识的显著差距。

Conclusion: FinTrust可作为金融领域大语言模型可信度评估的有价值基准。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Motivation: 当前ML社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个性化的不确定性量化方法，阻碍AI/ML在风险敏感领域应用，在高风险药物发现的蛋白质 - 配体亲和力预测中尤其具有挑战性。

Method: 引入TESSERA方法，结合专家混合的多样性和共形校准。

Conclusion: TESSERA提供了值得信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道和其他应用中的选择性预测和下游决策。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

Result: 在多个基准测试和不同模型规模上，DWRL始终优于生成式偏好模型基线和标量模型，能产生连贯、可解释思维。

Conclusion: DWRL是超越可验证任务的推理增强偏好学习通用框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Result: 证明了在标准假设下的存在性和收敛性，得到比受限摊销后验更严格的ELBO，在物理系统数值近似上表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法对潜变量能量基模型训练有效。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer架构有潜力支持鸟类疾病监测预警系统，实现及时干预和预防策略。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文多臂老虎机中的离线模仿学习，设计新方法在奖励类基数上样本复杂度为对数级。

Result: 表明似然最大化方法在弱假设下会失败，新方法有效。

Conclusion: 学习正确示范时应超越似然最大化。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Motivation: 流行的自动提示搜索方法在分布偏移和对抗性评估下性能下降，提示迁移性差，需要解决这一问题。

Method: DRO - InstructZero将零样本提示优化表述为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，用f - 散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，采用鲁棒采集规则。

Result: 在形式改写、代码调试和翻译等任务上表现提升，如BIG - Bench改写任务准确率从61.3 +/- 0.7%提升到约85 - 90%，自动调试在领域转移下有约+25分的提升，稳定任务保持高性能。

Conclusion: DRO - InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，提供了在现实世界不确定性下可靠、可迁移的提示对齐通用方法。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

Result: 在数值模拟和临床数据集上评估，在似然、反事实误差和政策评估指标上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法避免了对抗方案的训练不稳定性和调参负担，表现出色。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Conclusion: KME - CLIP改进了多模态对比预训练框架的相似度计算机制，表现更优。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

Conclusion: FMs正在催化向新科研范式的转变，旨在帮助科学界理解FMs的变革作用并反思科研发现的未来。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

TL;DR: 研究学习相关概率模型的统计和计算挑战，发现成对偏好数据不足，最佳三选一偏好数据可克服缺点，在真实数据集验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多随机效用模型（RUMs）存在独立无关选项（IIA）假设的缺点，且避免该假设的模型缺乏统计和计算保证。

Method: 先分析成对偏好数据在学习相关信息上的不足，再提出最佳三选一偏好数据并设计高效估计器。

Result: 证明最佳三选一偏好数据能克服缺点，设计的估计器有近乎最优表现，在真实数据集验证了理论保证。

Conclusion: 高阶偏好数据在学习相关效用时有好处，能更细粒度地建模人类偏好。

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于集合的数据同化方法在分析精度和计算效率间存在权衡，大集合尺寸提高精度会增加计算成本。

Method: 用较小集合尺寸通过EnKF生成初步分析状态，再用FCNN学习并预测这些状态的修正项。

Result: 新方法在相同集合尺寸下比传统EnKF精度更高，计算成本增加可忽略，且可与不同模型和其他基于集合的数据同化方法结合以适应不同应用。

Conclusion: 所提出的EnKF - FCNN方法是有效的，能在不显著增加计算成本的情况下提高分析精度，且具有广泛适应性。

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA具有鲁棒性和实用性，适用于动态的现实世界去中心化网络。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Motivation: 研究RFLAF的泛化性质，给出学习该模型所需特征数量的更精确边界。

Method: 采用数据依赖采样方案生成特征，提出统一定理描述特征数量复杂度，提出找近似核并应用杠杆加权采样的算法。

Result: MSE损失下，特征数量边界从Ω(1/ϵ²)改进到Ω((1/ϵ)^(1/t)) 甚至Ω(1)；Lipschitz损失下，从Ω(1/ϵ²)改进到Ω((1/ϵ²)^(1/t))；加权RFLAF用更少特征达相同性能。

Conclusion: 理论有效，加权RFLAF方法可显著减少所需特征数量。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Method: 利用MoE架构灵活性，提出基于互信息的逻辑多样性损失，让专家关注不同邻域结构；引入鲁棒性感知路由器识别扰动模式并路由节点。

Result: 在多种对抗设置下实验表明该方法对多种图对抗攻击有持续优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效防御图神经网络的多种对抗攻击。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Result: 在一系列时间序列建模数据集上取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 基于算子理论视角的序列建模新方法及谱均值流算法有效，可用于时间序列建模。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Conclusion: BREEZE框架有效提升了零样本强化学习的学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Conclusion: SWFP框架能有效微调预训练流，具有训练简单快速、降低计算和内存成本、有可证明的稳定性等优势。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的封闭形式公式解释了“深度信仰”，为设计高效Transformer架构开辟新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

Result: 在MuJoCo实验中，OffSim相比现有离线IRL方法有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: OffSim有效且鲁棒。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

Conclusion: 该工作为强化学习训练的大语言模型提供了结构化探索方法，有助于实现更有效和多样的推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Conclusion: 单射是语言模型的基本且可利用特性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署有直接影响。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: SDR框架为代理对干预进行战略响应时的因果推断提供了一种有原则的方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

Motivation: 理解特征学习对建立深度神经网络数学基础很重要，拓展NFA在不同网络结构和训练条件下的成立情况。

Method: 理论推导证明NFA在L层网络及不同初始化条件下的成立情况，通过数值实验验证理论。

Result: 将NFA拓展到L层网络，指数α = 1/L；不平衡初始化且应用权重衰减时NFA渐近成立；给出非线性激活网络中NFA不成立的反例。

Conclusion: NFA在不同网络结构和训练条件下有不同表现，其指数与网络深度有关，理论结果经实验验证。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Result: 实验表明Attn - JGNN模型比其他神经网络方法取得更好的结果。

Conclusion: Attn - JGNN模型能显著提高#SAT问题的求解精度。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

Motivation: 语义top - K选择的延迟和内存需求在边缘硬件上占主导，影响端到端预算。

Method: 提出整体转发方式，开发训练无关推理系统GRATING，通过渐进式集群剪枝降低延迟，用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略重叠I/O与计算来限制峰值内存。

Result: 在微基准测试中，GRATING最多降低89.0%的延迟和94.9%的峰值内存，且精度无损失；在三个实际设备AI应用中，降低11.6% - 51.0%的延迟和18.6% - 77.8%的峰值内存。

Conclusion: GRATING在效率和可部署性上有显著提升。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

Method: 提出基于合作博弈论Shapley值的CQD - SHAP框架，该框架满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 通过对解释的自动化评估及与各种基线的比较，表明该方法对大多数查询类型有效。

Conclusion: CQD - SHAP框架能有效解释查询各部分对答案排名的贡献，相比仅依赖KG现有事实的符号方法，更能体现从非完整KG中推断新知识的神经预测器的价值。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Result: 使用gem5模拟器和ARM处理器的实验显示，优化实现与传统基于整数的TM实现相比，推理时间最多减少96.71%，且代码密度相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化实现能在保持代码密度的同时，显著减少TM的推理时间。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

Conclusion: WARP - LUTs有扩展到高输入逻辑块的潜力，可推动在现代FPGA上的高效部署及实时科学应用研究。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and

*Kivanc Dogan,Ahmet Orhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文利用机器学习方法对内置式永磁同步电机（IPMSMs）的转子形状进行分类，对比多种算法，结果显示立方SVM和二次SVM算法准确率达100%，KS - Net模型达99.98%，证明数据驱动方法可高精度预测转子形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元法分析IPMSMs转子形状计算成本高，需要更高效方法对转子形状分类。

Method: 使用用户开发的KS - Net深度学习模型，与立方SVM、二次SVM等算法对比，用10折交叉验证测试9000个样本组成的平衡数据集，采用准确率、精确率等指标评估。

Result: 立方SVM和二次SVM算法分类准确率达100%，KS - Net模型准确率99.98%，仅两个样本分类错误。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可高精度预测IPMSMs转子形状，为电机设计、自动转子识别和故障诊断提供基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

TL;DR: 提出约束对抗扰动（CAP）算法，用于受限特征空间的通用对抗攻击，在多领域表现优且减少运行时间，还能学习特征约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动（UAP）方法忽视领域特定约束，限制了对抗样本的现实适用性。

Method: 通过制定基于增广拉格朗日的极小极大优化问题，使用基于梯度的交替优化策略求解，提出CAP算法，还引入从数据中学习特征约束的程序。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多领域评估，CAP攻击成功率更高，运行时间显著减少，对个体对抗扰动也有良好性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效推进通用对抗攻击到受限特征空间，具有广泛的跨领域适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

*Alex Gu,Bartosz Piotrowski,Fabian Gloeckle,Kaiyu Yang,Aram H. Markosyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 介绍了首个无需额外人工监督来简化Lean证明的语言模型ProofOptimizer，实验表明其能大幅压缩证明长度，简化证明检查更快且能提升下游证明器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经定理证明产生的证明过长，人类难以理解且缺乏训练数据，现有方法处理长证明有困难，因此需要进行证明简化。

Method: 引入ProofOptimizer，通过专家迭代和强化学习进行训练，利用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，推理时采用迭代缩短证明的工作流程。

Result: ProofOptimizer在标准基准上大幅压缩了先进RL训练证明器生成的证明长度，在miniF2F上减少87%，PutnamBench上减少57%，Seed - Prover的IMO 2025证明上减少49%。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer能有效简化证明，简化后的证明检查更快，还能提升下游证明器性能。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

TL;DR: 提出无模型算法ProSh用于成本约束下的安全强化学习，保证期望安全与最优性，实验证明训练时也能保证安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发不仅性能最优，还能提供安全形式保证的强化学习系统。

Method: 引入无模型算法ProSh，在约束MDP状态空间中增加风险预算，用学习的成本评判器对智能体策略分布应用屏蔽器。

Result: 在确定性环境中能保持最优性，给出期望成本的紧密上界，实验表明在温和假设下训练时也能保证安全。

Conclusion: ProSh算法可用于成本约束下的安全强化学习，且在训练和运行时都能保证一定的安全性。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Result: 在离散和连续环境实验中，该方法使强化学习智能体能学习有效策略，优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好处理非马尔可夫奖励有优势，是传统奖励建模可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的替代方案，且能学习接近最优的策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FEA计算成本高，不适用于许多设计优化问题，深度学习模型是解决方案，但选择准确模拟FEA的架构有挑战。

Method: 对参数化工字形梁的FEA，用GNNs和3D U - Nets作替代，引入受Navier Cauchy方程支配的PINN框架，采用课程学习策略。

Result: GNNs性能优于U - Net，MPNN和Graph Transformers精度最高，PINN显著提高泛化能力，Graph Transformer推理慢，MPNN PINN综合表现好。

Conclusion: PINN增强的MPNN在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间提供了良好平衡，是最实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数持续学习方法忽视网络校准，现有工作较少关注改善持续模型校准，期望提出方法提升校准和性能。

Method: 提出Sphere - Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对基于神经坍缩方法的自适应混合策略，使混合过程适应神经坍缩下特征空间的几何特性。

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升性能，超越持续学习中的SOTA方法，同时改善模型校准。

Conclusion: SAMix提升跨任务准确性和预测的可靠性，是稳健持续学习系统的有前景进展。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both

generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous
state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by
extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model.
AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near

Conclusion: SNOO计算和内存开销小、兼容模型分片，是多种内部优化器实用增强。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Result: 替代模型对过程保真度的估计优于现有学习技术，端到端框架显著提升不同噪声模型下量子电路的过程保真度。

Conclusion: FIDDLE框架能直接最大化过程保真度，优于依赖间接指标的传统方法。

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种迁移学习提供新途径，还需实验验证。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to
their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of
these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to
get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large
number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the
main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are
now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of

parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using
NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation
optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve
high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the
proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The
experimental results calculated over benchmarks functions of CEC2022
demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up
achieved in case of proposed parallel version. We also use two real world
applications (1) Tension/Compression Spring Design in engineering optimization
and (2) Image Thresholding using otsu method for testing the performance of
proposed implementation in handling real tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware,
considering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses
that can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g.,
4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a
subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of
neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values
themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for
optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low
precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression
efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a
value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows
SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints,
enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic
processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit
introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning
method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for
spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values
(M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs
compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization
schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic
hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.

TL;DR: 研究AI分诊设备对胸部CTPA检查中肺栓塞报告周转时间（TAT）的影响，对比前后数据并建立模型预测节省时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化AI分诊设备在胸部CTPA检查中对肺栓塞优先排序时，工作流程参数对报告周转时间节省的影响。

Method: 回顾性分析单中心11252例成人CTPA检查，分前后两期，对比PE阳性检查TAT，提取工作流参数输入计算模型。

Result: AI使用后PE阳性率升高，工作时间TAT显著缩短，节省时间与模型预测相符，非工作时间不显著。

Conclusion: 考虑和量化临床工作流程有助于准确评估AI分诊设备部署后TAT的预期时间节省。

Abstract: Objective: To quantify the impact of workflow parameters on time-savings in
report turnaround time (TAT) due to an AI-triage device that prioritized
pulmonary embolism (PE) in chest CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) exams.
Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 11252 adult CTPA exams conducted for
suspected PE at a single tertiary academic medical center. Data was divided
into two periods: pre-AI and post-AI. For PE-positive exams, TAT - defined as
the duration from patient scan completion to the first preliminary report
completion - was compared between the two periods. Time-savings were reported
separately for work-hour and off-hour cohorts. To characterize radiologist
workflow, 527234 records were retrieved from the PACS and workflow parameters
such as exam inter-arrival time and radiologist read-time extracted. These
parameters were input into a computational model to predict time-savings
following deployment of an AI-triage device and to study the impact of workflow
parameters. Results: The pre-AI dataset included 4694 chest CTPA exams with
13.3% being PE-positive. The post-AI dataset comprised 6558 exams with 16.2%
being PE-positive. The mean TAT for pre-AI and post-AI during work hours are
68.9 [95% CI" 55.0, 82.8] and 46.7 [38.1, 55.2] minutes respectively, and those
during off-hours are 44.8 [33.7, 55.9] and 42.0 [33.6, 50.3] minutes.
Clinically-observed time-savings during work hours (22.2 [95% CI: 5.85, 38.6]
minutes) were significant (p=0.004), while off-hour (2.82 [-11.1, 16.7]
minutes) were not (p=0.345). Observed time-savings aligned with model
predictions (29.6 [95% range: 23.2, 38.1] minutes for work hours; 2.10 [1.76,
2.58] minutes for off-hours). Discussion: Consideration and quantification of
clinical workflow contribute to an accurate assessment of the expected
time-savings in TAT following deployment of an AI-triage device.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用大语言模型自动生成片段对齐（SA）数据的增强方法，并采用两阶段训练策略提升代码翻译模型性能，实验显示有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码翻译的平行语料有限，以往研究主要关注程序对齐（PA）数据增强，缺乏对SA数据增强的探索。

Method: 提出利用大语言模型自动生成SA数据的方法，并采用两阶段训练策略结合PA和SA数据。

Result: 在TransCoder - test上实验表明，增强的SA数据结合两阶段训练方法比基线有持续改进，pass@k最高提升3.78%。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据增强方法和两阶段训练策略能有效提升代码翻译模型性能。

Abstract: Code translation aims to translate the code from its source language to the
target language and is used in various software development scenarios. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities
in code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training
models for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into
program-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has
complete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not
provide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length,
while the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due
to limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods
for code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In
this paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to
generate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we
explore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently
enhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data.
Experiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined
with the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the
baseline, achieving a maximum gain of 3.78% on pass@k.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在模拟程序执行和编程任务中的能力，排除因推理捷径等产生的可疑正确输出。

Method: 提出CES任务，引入连贯性概念和新指标，评估16个大语言模型，并与bug相关任务比较。

Result: 16个模型在HumanEval上81.42%执行模拟连贯，前沿模型执行推理不连贯，推理表现不一致，模型在bug相关任务主要靠模式匹配等。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在编程任务推理能力弱，缺乏推理威胁泛化性，CES可系统审查模型可疑成功。

Abstract: This paper proposes CES, a task to evaluate the abilities of LLMs in
simulating program execution and using that reasoning in programming tasks.
Besides measuring the correctness of variable predictions during execution
simulation, CES introduces the notion of coherence to determine whether the
simulation complies with commonsense execution logic, even if the predicted
values along the simulations are incorrect. This enables CES to rule out
suspiciously correct output predictions due to reasoning shortcuts,
hallucinations, or potential data leakage. CES also introduces a novel metric
to measure reasoning consistency across tests with the same or different prime
path coverage in a spectrum: strong, weak, and random. Evaluating 16 LLMs
(including three reasoning LLMs) using CES indicates 81.42% coherent execution
simulation on HumanEval, 46.92% and 53.08% of which result in correct and
incorrect output predictions. Frontier LLMs such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1 have
the most incoherent execution reasoning, mostly due to natural language
shortcuts. Despite relatively coherent execution simulation, LLMs' reasoning
performance across different tests is inconsistent, mostly random (48.87%) or
weak (45.37%), potentially explaining their weakness in programming tasks that
require path-sensitive program analysis to succeed. We also compare CES with
bug prediction/localization/repair, which intuitively requires control- and
data-flow awareness. We observe that LLMs barely incorporate execution
reasoning into their analysis for bug-related tasks, and their success is
primarily due to inherent abilities in pattern matching or natural language
shortcuts, if not data leakage. Without reasoning, there is a threat to the
generalizability of LLMs in dealing with unseen bugs or patterns in different
contexts. CES can be used to vet the suspicious success of LLMs in these tasks
systematically.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型能否生成快速代码。

Method: 用从开源Java程序挖掘的65个真实任务数据集，用两个领先大语言模型在四种提示变体下生成补丁，与基线和人类编写方案严格对比测试。

Result: 大语言模型生成代码多数情况能提升性能，但人类开发者补丁表现更优；约三分之二语义与开发者优化思路相同，三分之一有原创想法，但原创想法很少带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生成快速代码方面常无法找到最优解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, but can they generate fast
code? In this paper, we study this question using a dataset of 65 real-world
tasks mined from open-source Java programs. We specifically select tasks where
developers achieved significant speedups, and employ an automated pipeline to
generate patches for these issues using two leading LLMs under four prompt
variations. By rigorously benchmarking the results against the baseline and
human-authored solutions, we demonstrate that LLM-generated code indeed
improves performance over the baseline in most cases. However, patches proposed
by human developers outperform LLM fixes by a statistically significant margin,
indicating that LLMs often fall short of finding truly optimal solutions. We
further find that LLM solutions are semantically identical or similar to the
developer optimization idea in approximately two-thirds of cases, whereas they
propose a more original idea in the remaining one-third. However, these
original ideas only occasionally yield substantial performance gains.

Motivation: 探究社区参与对开源软件项目动态和寿命的可量化影响，此前该领域研究不足。

Method: 分析33,946个GitHub仓库，用每月有效指标定义和衡量社区参与，通过非参数检验和相关性分析评估与项目动态和寿命的关系。

Result: 社区参与指标与项目动态显著相关，在高参与项目中相关性更强；年轻项目月参与率高，随年龄下降，但部分长寿项目保持高活跃度；初始参与爆发利于项目建立，持续高参与推动超长寿命；活跃问题参与影响随年龄增强，被动关注影响下降。

Conclusion: 社区参与动态推动开源软件项目的长寿和发展，研究确立了有效的社区参与指标，深入揭示不同社区活动模式对项目寿命的贡献。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) projects depend on community engagement (CE) for
longevity. However, CE's quantifiable impact on project dynamics and lifespan
is underexplored. Objectives: This study defines CE in OSS, identifies key
metrics, and evaluates their influence on project dynamics (releases, commits,
branches) and lifespan. Methods: We analyzed 33,946 GitHub repositories,
defining and operationalizing CE with validated per-month metrics (issues,
comments, watchers, stargazers). Non-parametric tests and correlations assessed
relationships with project dynamics and lifespan across quartiles. Results: CE
metrics significantly associate with project dynamics, with stronger
correlations in highly engaged projects. For lifespan, a complex pattern
emerged: per-month CE rates are highest in younger projects, declining with
age. Yet, a subset of long-lived projects maintains exceptionally high
activity. Initial CE bursts appear crucial for establishment, while sustained
high engagement drives extreme longevity. Active issue engagement's influence
intensifies with age, but passive attention's declines. Conclusion: CE
dynamically drives OSS project longevity and development. Our findings
establish validated CE metrics and offer deeper insights into how diverse
community activity patterns contribute to project longevity.

Motivation: 代码克隆存在风险，有效高效的克隆检测有挑战，LLM用于克隆检测，需解决模型选择和集成效果问题。

Method: 筛选76个LLM在两个公开数据集和一个商业数据集上评估，分析模型特征；探索所选LLM的集成方法。

Result: 无统一最佳LLM，CodeT5+110M、CuBERT和SPTCode表现佳；CodeT5+110M在商业数据集上精度达39.71%；集成方法中归一化得分重要，最大或求和法优于平均法，最佳集成在商业数据集上精度达46.91%。

Conclusion: 确定了适合大规模克隆检测的LLM及优势特征，证明LLM集成方法在大数据集上有效。

Abstract: Source code clones pose risks ranging from intellectual property violations
to unintended vulnerabilities. Effective and efficient scalable clone
detection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the
rapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and
potential LLM-ensemble efficacy.
  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering
them down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The
candidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and
a commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though
CodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates
suggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and
tailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a
top-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\% precision: twice the precision of
previously used CodeBERT.
  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the
selected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results
suggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods
like maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling
approach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the
best-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\% over
individual LLM on the commercial large-scale code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码审查主要依赖静态检查，未充分探索程序动态方面，模糊测试虽有潜力但缺乏分析机制，需新方法辅助早期代码审查。

Method: 提出FuzzSight框架，利用非崩溃模糊测试输入的可能不变量突出程序版本间的行为差异。

Result: FuzzSight标记了75%的回归错误和高达80%的24小时模糊测试发现的漏洞，在识别错误代码块上优于SAST，检测率高且误报少。

Conclusion: FuzzSight展示了利用模糊测试和不变量分析进行早期代码审查的潜力和价值，弥合了静态检查与动态行为洞察的差距。

Abstract: Many software projects employ manual code review to gatekeep defects and
vulnerabilities in the code before integration. However, reviewers often work
under time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the
dynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such
behaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is
typically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise
code with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but
unexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze
program behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible
to reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.
  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify
potential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at
runtime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties
consistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals
of behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended
changes and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes.
  We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from
non-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program
versions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code
blocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of
regression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing.
It also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times
higher detection rates with fewer false alarms. In summary, FuzzSight
demonstrates the potential and value of leveraging fuzzing and invariant
analysis for early-stage code review, bridging static inspection with dynamic
behavioral insights.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness
trackers has fueled the demand for reliable physiological and movement data
collection tools. However, challenges such as limited access to large,
high-quality public datasets and a lack of control over data collection
conditions hinder the development of robust algorithms. This work presents
Colepp, an open-source, cross-platform tool designed to collect and synchronize
data from multiple wearable devices, including heart rate (via ECG and PPG) and
motion signals (accelerometer and gyroscope). The system integrates a
smartphone as a central hub, receiving data from a Polar H10 chest strap and a
Wear OS smartwatch, and exporting synchronized datasets in CSV format. Through
a custom synchronization protocol and user-friendly interface, Colepp
facilitates the generation of customizable, real-world datasets suitable for
applications such as human activity recognition and heart rate estimation. A
use case shows the effectiveness of the tool in producing consistent and
synchronized signals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for
generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their
impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical
issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic
errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial
modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are
paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that
integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development
(TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the
correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We
hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints
and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate,
verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across
diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting
languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an
explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant
groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By
emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking,
prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting
spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious
consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and
empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible
and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development
practices.

Abstract: In open-source software design, the inclusion of women is often highlighted
simply to remind programmers that women exist. Yet, little attention is given
to how greater gender diversity, specifically women's participation, could
fundamentally alter development patterns. To understand the potential impact of
gender inclusion, this study investigates React, a widely used JavaScript
library for building user interfaces with an active contributor community. I
examine gender differences in metrics of robustness and innovation, as well as
shifts in contribution patterns leading up to major version releases over 11
years of the React project. My results show that the exclusion of women is
detrimental to software as women contribute significantly more to feature
enhancement and dependency management. By exploring how gender influences
innovation and robustness in the development of React, the study offers
critical insights into how increasing gender diversity could lead to more
inclusive, innovative, and robust software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL框架中的bug会影响上层应用，现有研究对跨框架API模式及潜在风险探索有限，为解决共享bug问题提出方案。

Method: MirrorFuzz分三步：收集API历史bug数据，匹配不同框架的相似API，用大语言模型合成代码触发类似bug。

Result: 在TensorFlow和PyTorch上分别提升代码覆盖率39.92%和98.20%，发现315个bug，262个新bug，80个已修复，52个获CNVD ID。

Conclusion: MirrorFuzz能有效发现DL框架中的共享bug，提高代码覆盖率。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) frameworks serve as the backbone for a wide range of
artificial intelligence applications. However, bugs within DL frameworks can
cascade into critical issues in higher-level applications, jeopardizing
reliability and security. While numerous techniques have been proposed to
detect bugs in DL frameworks, research exploring common API patterns across
frameworks and the potential risks they entail remains limited. Notably, many
DL frameworks expose similar APIs with overlapping input parameters and
functionalities, rendering them vulnerable to shared bugs, where a flaw in one
API may extend to analogous APIs in other frameworks. To address this
challenge, we propose MirrorFuzz, an automated API fuzzing solution to discover
shared bugs in DL frameworks. MirrorFuzz operates in three stages: First,
MirrorFuzz collects historical bug data for each API within a DL framework to
identify potentially buggy APIs. Second, it matches each buggy API in a
specific framework with similar APIs within and across other DL frameworks.
Third, it employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize code for the API
under test, leveraging the historical bug data of similar APIs to trigger
analogous bugs across APIs. We implement MirrorFuzz and evaluate it on four
popular DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OneFlow, and Jittor). Extensive
evaluation demonstrates that MirrorFuzz improves code coverage by 39.92\% and
98.20\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on TensorFlow and PyTorch,
respectively. Moreover, MirrorFuzz discovers 315 bugs, 262 of which are newly
found, and 80 bugs are fixed, with 52 of these bugs assigned CNVD IDs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning and adaptive cognitive systems are
driving a growing demand for large and richly annotated multimodal data. A
prominent example of this trend are fusion models, which increasingly
incorporate multiple biosignals in addition to traditional audiovisual
channels. This paper introduces the EASELAN annotation framework to improve
annotation workflows designed to address the resulting rising complexity of
multimodal and biosignals datasets. It builds on the robust ELAN tool by adding
new components tailored to support all stages of the annotation pipeline: From
streamlining the preparation of annotation files to setting up additional
channels, integrated version control with GitHub, and simplified
post-processing. EASELAN delivers a seamless workflow designed to integrate
biosignals and facilitate rich annotations to be readily exported for further
analyses and machine learning-supported model training. The EASELAN framework
is successfully applied to a high-dimensional biosignals collection initiative
on human everyday activities (here, table setting) for cognitive robots within
the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center 1320 Everyday Activity Science and
Engineering (EASE). In this paper we discuss the opportunities, limitations,
and lessons learned when using EASELAN for this initiative. To foster research
on biosignal collection, annotation, and processing, the code of EASELAN is
publicly available(https://github.com/cognitive-systems-lab/easelan), along
with the EASELAN-supported fully annotated Table Setting Database.

Motivation: OSS维护者缺乏依赖项目对其API使用的反馈，获取这些信息有助于做出更好决策。

Method: 提出基于社区的分析方法，对10个流行Java库及其各50个依赖项目进行实证研究，提出评估指标并开展开源从业者调查。

Result: 库开发者提供的API方法平均仅16%被依赖生态系统使用，74%的使用方法被测试套件部分或完全覆盖。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和指标有助于指导OSS库的维护决策。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) is a pillar of modern software development. Its
success depends on the dedication of maintainers who work constantly to keep
their libraries stable, adapt to changing needs, and support a growing
community. Yet, they receive little to no continuous feedback on how the
projects that rely on their libraries actually use their APIs. We believe that
gaining these insights can help maintainers make better decisions, such as
refining testing strategies, understanding the impact of changes, and guiding
the evolution of their libraries more effectively. We propose the use of
community-based analytics to analyze how an OSS library is used across its
dependent ecosystem. We conduct an empirical study of 10 popular Java libraries
and each with their respective dependent ecosystem of 50 projects. Our results
reveal that while library developers offer a wide range of API methods, only
16% on average are actively used by their dependent ecosystem. Moreover, only
74% of the used API methods are partially or fully covered by their library
test suite. We propose two metrics to help developers evaluate their test suite
according to the APIs used by their community, and we conduct a survey on
open-source practitioners to assess the practical value of these insights in
guiding maintenance decisions.

Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks,
including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management.
Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various
characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and
transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in
large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for
leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock
selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified
representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM.
Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation
combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next,
building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture
model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their
fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we
introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our
experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective
multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.

### [176] [DeepAries: Adaptive Rebalancing Interval Selection for Enhanced Portfolio Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14985)
*Jinkyu Kim,Hyunjung Yi,Mogan Gim,Donghee Choi,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 提出DeepAries框架用于动态投资组合管理，能自适应选择再平衡时机和资产分配，实验显示其表现优于传统策略，还提供演示、代码和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法采用固定再平衡间隔，未考虑市场条件，需要减少不必要交易成本并最大化风险调整回报。

Method: 集成基于Transformer的状态编码器和近端策略优化（PPO），生成离散（再平衡间隔）和连续（资产分配）动作。

Result: 在多个真实金融市场的实验中，DeepAries在风险调整回报、交易成本和回撤方面显著优于传统固定频率和全面再平衡策略。

Conclusion: DeepAries将时机和分配整合到统一决策过程，为自适应和实用的投资组合管理引入了创新范式。

Abstract: We propose DeepAries , a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for
dynamic portfolio management that jointly optimizes the timing and allocation
of rebalancing decisions. Unlike prior reinforcement learning methods that
employ fixed rebalancing intervals regardless of market conditions, DeepAries
adaptively selects optimal rebalancing intervals along with portfolio weights
to reduce unnecessary transaction costs and maximize risk-adjusted returns. Our
framework integrates a Transformer-based state encoder, which effectively
captures complex long-term market dependencies, with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) to generate simultaneous discrete (rebalancing intervals)
and continuous (asset allocations) actions. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world financial markets demonstrate that DeepAries significantly
outperforms traditional fixed-frequency and full-rebalancing strategies in
terms of risk-adjusted returns, transaction costs, and drawdowns. Additionally,
we provide a live demo of DeepAries at https://deep-aries.github.io/, along
with the source code and dataset at https://github.com/dmis-lab/DeepAries,
illustrating DeepAries' capability to produce interpretable rebalancing and
allocation decisions aligned with shifting market regimes. Overall, DeepAries
introduces an innovative paradigm for adaptive and practical portfolio
management by integrating both timing and allocation into a unified
decision-making process.

Motivation: 金融市场非平稳，标准投资组合优化方法难以适应变化。

Method: 提出RegimeFolio框架，结合市场制度检测、特定制度和行业的集成学习、动态均值 - 方差优化。

Conclusion: 在预测学习和投资组合分配中明确建模波动率制度可增强稳健性，实现更可靠决策。

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary, with shifting volatility
regimes that alter asset co-movements and return distributions. Standard
portfolio optimization methods, typically built on stationarity or
regime-agnostic assumptions, struggle to adapt to such changes. To address
these challenges, we propose RegimeFolio, a novel regime-aware and
sector-specialized framework that, unlike existing regime-agnostic models such
as DeepVol and DRL optimizers, integrates explicit volatility regime
segmentation with sector-specific ensemble forecasting and adaptive
mean-variance allocation. This modular architecture ensures forecasts and
portfolio decisions remain aligned with current market conditions, enhancing
robustness and interpretability in dynamic markets. RegimeFolio combines three
components: (i) an interpretable VIX-based classifier for market regime
detection; (ii) regime and sector-specific ensemble learners (Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting) to capture conditional return structures; and (iii) a
dynamic mean-variance optimizer with shrinkage-regularized covariance estimates
for regime-aware allocation. We evaluate RegimeFolio on 34 large cap U.S.
equities from 2020 to 2024. The framework achieves a cumulative return of 137
percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.17, a 12 percent lower maximum drawdown, and a 15
to 20 percent improvement in forecast accuracy compared to conventional and
advanced machine learning benchmarks. These results show that explicitly
modeling volatility regimes in predictive learning and portfolio allocation
enhances robustness and leads to more dependable decision-making in real
markets.

TL;DR: 本文引入等权重投资组合（EWPs）的选择置信集（SCS），量化选择不确定性，理论证明其高概率覆盖最优选择，并通过实验验证，应用案例强调考虑选择不确定性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法忽略等权重投资组合子集选择的不确定性，未考虑其他可能表现良好的投资策略。

Method: 引入选择置信集（SCS）来量化选择不确定性，通过理论分析和蒙特卡罗实验进行验证。

Result: 理论上SCS能以高概率覆盖未知最优选择，其大小随不确定性变化，蒙特卡罗实验证实相关结果。

Conclusion: 在比较等权重策略时，考虑选择不确定性十分重要。

Abstract: Given a universe of N assets, investors often form equally weighted
portfolios (EWPs) by selecting subsets of assets. EWPs are simple, robust, and
competitive out-of-sample, yet the uncertainty about which subset truly
performs best is largely ignored. Traditional approaches typically rely on a
single selected portfolio, but this fails to consider alternative investment
strategies that may perform just as well when accounting for statistical
uncertainty. To address this selection uncertainty, we introduce the Selection
Confidence Set (SCS) for EWPs: the set of all portfolios that, under a given
loss function and at a specified confidence level, contains the unknown set of
optimal portfolios under repeated sampling. The SCS quantifies selection
uncertainty by identifying a range of plausible portfolios, challenging the
idea of a uniquely optimal choice. Like a confidence set, its size reflects
uncertainty -- growing with noisy or limited data, and shrinking as the sample
size increases. Theoretically, we establish that the SCS covers the unknown
optimal selection with high probability and characterize how its size grows
with underlying uncertainty, corroborating these results through Monte Carlo
experiments. Applications to the French 17-Industry Portfolios and Layer-1
cryptocurrencies underscore the importance of accounting for selection
uncertainty when comparing equally weighted strategies.

Motivation: 新冠疫情后印尼股市投资者增加，经典均值 - 方差优化模型依赖不确定的历史数据，可能导致次优投资组合，需改进。

Method: 使用移动窗口和自举法构建不确定性集，并应用于不同风险厌恶参数的印尼银行股票数据。

Result: 移动窗口法的稳健优化，尤其是在较小风险厌恶参数下，比自举法有更好的风险 - 回报权衡。

Conclusion: 移动窗口法可为风险偏好投资者生成更有效的投资组合策略。

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of investors in the Indonesia Stock
Exchange has steadily increased, emphasizing the importance of portfolio
optimization in balancing risk and return. The classical mean-variance
optimization model, while widely applied, depends on historical return and risk
estimates that are uncertain and may result in suboptimal portfolios. To
address this limitation, robust optimization incorporates uncertainty sets to
improve portfolio reliability under market fluctuations. This study constructs
such sets using moving-window and bootstrapping methods and applies them to
Indonesian banking stock data with varying risk-aversion parameters. The
results show that robust optimization with the moving-window method,
particularly with a smaller risk-aversion parameter, provides a better
risk-return trade-off compared to the bootstrapping approach. These findings
highlight the potential of the moving-window method to generate more effective
portfolio strategies for risk-tolerant investors.

Conclusion: 研究结果为近期对承保周期实证证据的质疑提供潜在解释，表明承保周期可能存在但比以前认为的更长。

Abstract: With the rise of emerging risks, model uncertainty poses a fundamental
challenge in the insurance industry, making robust pricing a first-order
question. This paper investigates how insurers' robustness preferences shape
competitive equilibrium in a dynamic insurance market. Insurers optimize their
underwriting and liquidity management strategies to maximize shareholder value,
leading to equilibrium outcomes that can be analytically derived and
numerically solved. Compared to a benchmark without model uncertainty, robust
insurance pricing results in significantly higher premiums and equity
valuations. Notably, our model yields three novel insights: (1) The minimum,
maximum, and admissible range of aggregate capacity all expand, indicating that
insurers' liquidity management becomes more conservative. (2) The expected
length of the underwriting cycle increases substantially, far exceeding the
range commonly reported in earlier empirical studies. (3) While the capacity
process remains ergodic in the long run, the stationary density becomes more
concentrated in low-capacity states, implying that liquidity-constrained
insurers require longer to recover. Together, these findings provide a
potential explanation for recent skepticism regarding the empirical evidence of
underwriting cycles, suggesting that such cycles may indeed exist but are
considerably longer than previously assumed.

Conclusion: 实现了热带视角与平滑多层感知机的连接，当前聚焦二维构建和实证，理论分析和高维扩展留待未来研究。

Abstract: We revisit the Universal Approximation Theorem(UAT) through the lens of the
tropical geometry of neural networks and introduce a constructive,
geometry-aware initialization for sigmoidal multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
Tropical geometry shows that Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks admit
decision functions with a combinatorial structure often described as a tropical
rational, namely a difference of tropical polynomials. Focusing on planar
binary classification, we design purely sigmoidal MLPs that adhere to the
finite-sum format of UAT: a finite linear combination of shifted and scaled
sigmoids of affine functions. The resulting models yield decision boundaries
that already align with prescribed shapes at initialization and can be refined
by standard training if desired. This provides a practical bridge between the
tropical perspective and smooth MLPs, enabling interpretable, shape-driven
initialization without resorting to ReLU architectures. We focus on the
construction and empirical demonstrations in two dimensions; theoretical
analysis and higher-dimensional extensions are left for future work.

Conclusion: 在因果模型相关的数据增强任务中，使用尊重因果结构的生成模型很重要，新提出的架构有良好效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that interventionally robust optimization problems in
causal models are continuous under the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance, but may
be discontinuous under the standard Wasserstein distance. This highlights the
importance of using generative models that respect the causal structure when
augmenting data for such tasks. To this end, we propose a new normalizing flow
architecture that satisfies a universal approximation property for causal
structural models and can be efficiently trained to minimize the $G$-causal
Wasserstein distance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model outperforms
standard (non-causal) generative models in data augmentation for causal
regression and mean-variance portfolio optimization in causal factor models.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯社区检测是跨领域高维数据中揭示模块化结构的原则性和抗噪声框架。

Abstract: From neuroscience and genomics to systems biology and ecology, researchers
rely on clustering similarity data to uncover modular structure. Yet widely
used clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and WGCNA,
lack principled model selection, leaving them susceptible to noise. A common
workaround sparsifies a correlation matrix representation to remove noise
before clustering, but this extra step introduces arbitrary thresholds that can
distort the structure and lead to unreliable results. To detect reliable
clusters, we capitalize on recent advances in network science to unite
sparsification and clustering with principled model selection. We test two
Bayesian community detection methods, the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block
Model and the Regularized Map Equation, both grounded in the Minimum
Description Length principle for model selection. In synthetic data, they
outperform traditional approaches, detecting planted clusters under high-noise
conditions and with fewer samples. Compared to WGCNA on gene co-expression
data, the Regularized Map Equation identifies more robust and functionally
coherent gene modules. Our results establish Bayesian community detection as a
principled and noise-resistant framework for uncovering modular structure in
high-dimensional data across fields.

Conclusion: 该思想可扩展到其他吸引 - 排斥方法，并通过多个例子进行了说明。

Abstract: The clustering and visualisation of high-dimensional data is a ubiquitous
task in modern data science. Popular techniques include nonlinear
dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or UMAP. These methods face the
`scale-problem' of clustering: when dealing with the MNIST dataset, do we want
to distinguish different digits or do we want to distinguish different ways of
writing the digits? The answer is task dependent and depends on scale. We
revisit an idea of Robinson & Pierce-Hoffman that exploits an underlying
scaling symmetry in t-SNE to replace 2-dimensional with (2+1)-dimensional
embeddings where the additional parameter accounts for scale. This gives rise
to the t-SNE tree (short: tree-SNE). We prove that the optimal embedding
depends continuously on the scaling parameter for all initial conditions
outside a set of measure 0: the tree-SNE tree exists. This idea conceivably
extends to other attraction-repulsion methods and is illustrated on several
examples.

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large
text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training
shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably,
although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss,
cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we
provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of
\emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model
places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for
post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our
main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a
phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model
with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the
power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage
generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on
problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study
practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving
coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient
normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
quantifying goodness-of-fit over the last decade, featuring numerous successful
applications. To the best of our knowledge, all existing KSD estimators with
known rate achieve $\sqrt n$-convergence. In this work, we present two
complementary results (with different proof strategies), establishing that the
minimax lower bound of KSD estimation is $n^{-1/2}$ and settling the optimality
of these estimators. Our first result focuses on KSD estimation on $\mathbb
R^d$ with the Langevin-Stein operator; our explicit constant for the Gaussian
kernel indicates that the difficulty of KSD estimation may increase
exponentially with the dimensionality $d$. Our second result settles the
minimax lower bound for KSD estimation on general domains.

Conclusion: 所提的流形维度估计框架有效，QE和TLS估计器表现良好。

Abstract: Local principal component analysis (Local PCA) has proven to be an effective
tool for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a manifold. More recently,
curvature-adjusted PCA (CA-PCA) has improved upon this approach by explicitly
accounting for the curvature of the underlying manifold, rather than assuming
local flatness. Building on these insights, we propose a general framework for
manifold dimension estimation that captures the manifold's local graph
structure by integrating PCA with regression-based techniques. Within this
framework, we introduce two representative estimators: quadratic embedding (QE)
and total least squares (TLS). Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that these methods perform competitively with, and often
outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: FRONT方法能有效考虑决策的长期影响，管理干扰，减少遗憾，可用于实际在线决策。

Abstract: Contextual bandits, which leverage the baseline features of sequentially
arriving individuals to optimize cumulative rewards while balancing exploration
and exploitation, are critical for online decision-making. Existing approaches
typically assume no interference, where each individual's action affects only
their own reward. Yet, such an assumption can be violated in many practical
scenarios, and the oversight of interference can lead to short-sighted policies
that focus solely on maximizing the immediate outcomes for individuals, which
further results in suboptimal decisions and potentially increased regret over
time. To address this significant gap, we introduce the foresighted online
policy with interference (FRONT) that innovatively considers the long-term
impact of the current decision on subsequent decisions and rewards. The
proposed FRONT method employs a sequence of exploratory and exploitative
strategies to manage the intricacies of interference, ensuring robust parameter
inference and regret minimization. Theoretically, we establish a tail bound for
the online estimator and derive the asymptotic distribution of the parameters
of interest under suitable conditions on the interference network. We further
show that FRONT attains sublinear regret under two distinct definitions,
capturing both the immediate and consequential impacts of decisions, and we
establish these results with and without statistical inference. The
effectiveness of FRONT is further demonstrated through extensive simulations
and a real-world application to urban hotel profits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transfer learning is a key component of modern machine learning, enhancing
the performance of target tasks by leveraging diverse data sources.
Simultaneously, overparameterized models such as the minimum-$\ell_2$-norm
interpolator (MNI) in high-dimensional linear regression have garnered
significant attention for their remarkable generalization capabilities, a
property known as benign overfitting. Despite their individual importance, the
intersection of transfer learning and MNI remains largely unexplored. Our
research bridges this gap by proposing a novel two-step Transfer MNI approach
and analyzing its trade-offs. We characterize its non-asymptotic excess risk
and identify conditions under which it outperforms the target-only MNI. Our
analysis reveals free-lunch covariate shift regimes, where leveraging
heterogeneous data yields the benefit of knowledge transfer at limited cost. To
operationalize our findings, we develop a data-driven procedure to detect
informative sources and introduce an ensemble method incorporating multiple
informative Transfer MNIs. Finite-sample experiments demonstrate the robustness
of our methods to model and data heterogeneity, confirming their advantage.

TL;DR: 现有语义分割方法结果不佳，RankSEG虽能提升性能但有计算成本高和适用场景局限问题，本文用RMA改进，降低复杂度并适用于非重叠分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RankSEG计算成本高和仅适用于重叠分割设置的问题。

Method: 对RankSEG进行互惠矩近似（RMA），得到RankSEG - RMA；受RMA启发开发像素级得分函数。

Result: 将RankSEG的复杂度降低到O(d)并保持可比性能，实现非重叠分割的高效计算。

Conclusion: 通过RMA改进RankSEG，克服了其原有的两个缺点。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image with its corresponding
class, and is typically evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) and
Dice metrics to quantify the overlap between predicted and ground-truth
segmentation masks. In the literature, most existing methods estimate
pixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the
final prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to
inconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize
segmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation
framework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU
specifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.
Although RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two
major drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a
complexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents
the number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),
thus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with
RankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.
Second, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where
multiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard
benchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,
we overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of
RankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,
namely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while
maintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a
pixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for
non-overlapping segmentation settings.

TL;DR: 研究非独立同分布（non - i.i.d.）且具信号 - 噪声因果结构数据的核岭回归（KRR）泛化性，推导新的超额风险界并应用于去噪分数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KRR理论主要针对独立同分布数据，而现实数据常存在结构依赖，因此有必要研究非独立同分布数据的KRR泛化性。

Method: 开发新的分块分解方法，对相关数据进行精确集中分析。

Result: 推导出KRR的超额风险界，该界明确依赖于核谱、因果结构参数和采样机制；将结果应用于去噪分数学习，建立泛化保证并为采样提供指导。

Conclusion: 推进了KRR理论，为现代机器学习应用中分析相关数据提供实用工具。

Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a foundational tool in machine learning,
with recent work emphasizing its connections to neural networks. However,
existing theory primarily addresses the i.i.d. setting, while real-world data
often exhibits structured dependencies - particularly in applications like
denoising score learning where multiple noisy observations derive from shared
underlying signals. We present the first systematic study of KRR generalization
for non-i.i.d. data with signal-noise causal structure, where observations
represent different noisy views of common signals. By developing a novel
blockwise decomposition method that enables precise concentration analysis for
dependent data, we derive excess risk bounds for KRR that explicitly depend on:
(1) the kernel spectrum, (2) causal structure parameters, and (3) sampling
mechanisms (including relative sample sizes for signals and noises). We further
apply our results to denoising score learning, establishing generalization
guarantees and providing principled guidance for sampling noisy data points.
This work advances KRR theory while providing practical tools for analyzing
dependent data in modern machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于高斯过程状态空间模型的递归学习方法用于系统动态在线学习，在合成和真实数据集上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实系统具有多通道和高度非线性过渡动态，传统建模方法面临挑战，需要实现这些系统的在线学习。

Method: 将系统建模为高斯过程状态空间模型（GPSSMs），设计异构多输出核，开发诱导点管理算法，推导统一的递归推理框架。

Result: 该方法在合成和真实数据集实验中，仅用SOTA离线GPSSMs 1/100的运行时间达到相同精度，在重噪声下精度比SOTA在线GPSSMs高约70%，且运行时间仅为1/20。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能实现准确的在线学习，在效率和精度上有显著优势。

Abstract: Accurate learning of system dynamics is becoming increasingly crucial for
advanced control and decision-making in engineering. However, real-world
systems often exhibit multiple channels and highly nonlinear transition
dynamics, challenging traditional modeling methods. To enable online learning
for these systems, this paper formulates the system as Gaussian process
state-space models (GPSSMs) and develops a recursive learning method. The main
contributions are threefold. First, a heterogeneous multi-output kernel is
designed, allowing each output dimension to adopt distinct kernel types,
hyperparameters, and input variables, improving expressiveness in
multi-dimensional dynamics learning. Second, an inducing-point management
algorithm enhances computational efficiency through independent selection and
pruning for each output dimension. Third, a unified recursive inference
framework for GPSSMs is derived, supporting general moment matching approaches,
including the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and
assumed density filtering (ADF), enabling accurate learning under strong
nonlinearity and significant noise. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of SOTA offline
GPSSMs with only 1/100 of the runtime, and surpasses SOTA online GPSSMs by
around 70% in accuracy under heavy noise while using only 1/20 of the runtime.

Abstract: Open world Machine Learning (OWML) aims to develop intelligent systems
capable of recognizing known categories, rejecting unknown samples, and
continually learning from novel information. Despite significant progress in
open set recognition, novelty detection, and continual learning, the field
still lacks a unified theoretical foundation that can quantify uncertainty,
characterize information transfer, and explain learning adaptability in
dynamic, nonstationary environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of information theoretic approaches in open world machine learning, emphasizing
how core concepts such as entropy, mutual information, and Kullback Leibler
divergence provide a mathematical language for describing knowledge
acquisition, uncertainty suppression, and risk control under open world
conditions. We synthesize recent studies into three major research axes:
information theoretic open set recognition enabling safe rejection of unknowns,
information driven novelty discovery guiding new concept formation, and
information retentive continual learning ensuring stable long term adaptation.
Furthermore, we discuss theoretical connections between information theory and
provable learning frameworks, including PAC Bayes bounds, open-space risk
theory, and causal information flow, to establish a pathway toward provable and
trustworthy open world intelligence. Finally, the review identifies key open
problems and future research directions, such as the quantification of
information risk, development of dynamic mutual information bounds, multimodal
information fusion, and integration of information theory with causal reasoning
and world model learning.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Adaptive experiments produce dependent data that break i.i.d. assumptions
that underlie classical concentration bounds and invalidate standard learning
guarantees. In this paper, we develop a self-normalized maximal inequality for
martingale empirical processes. Building on this, we first propose an adaptive
sample-variance penalization procedure which balances empirical loss and sample
variance, valid for general dependent data. Next, this allows us to derive a
new variance-regularized pessimistic off-policy learning objective, for which
we establish excess-risk guarantees. Subsequently, we show that, when combined
with sequential updates and under standard complexity and margin conditions,
the resulting estimator achieves fast convergence rates in both parametric and
nonparametric regimes, improving over the usual $1/\sqrt{n}$
  baseline. We complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations
that illustrate the practical gains of our approach.

Motivation: 由于目标函数在欧几里得空间的非凸性和非光滑性，VI的收敛性分析具有挑战性。

Method: 利用分布的指数族结构，将负ELBO表示为关于对数配分函数的Bregman散度，进行目标函数优化景观的几何分析，推导参数空间射线方向上目标函数的界。

Result: Bregman表示具有弱单调性，收敛性分析受Fisher信息矩阵谱特征控制，证明了恒定和递减步长梯度下降算法的非渐近收敛率。

Conclusion: 所建立的几何框架可用于严格分析VI收敛性。

Abstract: Variational Inference (VI) provides a scalable framework for Bayesian
inference by optimizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), but convergence
analysis remains challenging due to the objective's non-convexity and
non-smoothness in Euclidean space. We establish a novel theoretical framework
for analyzing VI convergence by exploiting the exponential family structure of
distributions. We express negative ELBO as a Bregman divergence with respect to
the log-partition function, enabling a geometric analysis of the optimization
landscape. We show that this Bregman representation admits a weak monotonicity
property that, while weaker than convexity, provides sufficient structure for
rigorous convergence analysis. By deriving bounds on the objective function
along rays in parameter space, we establish properties governed by the spectral
characteristics of the Fisher information matrix. Under this geometric
framework, we prove non-asymptotic convergence rates for gradient descent
algorithms with both constant and diminishing step sizes.

Result: 分析ProteinMPNN模型，拒绝其拟合数据的假设，调整温度超参数获得更好拟合。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于核的工具在评估模型和调参方面有效。

Abstract: We propose a set of kernel-based tools to evaluate the designs and tune the
hyperparameters of conditional sequence models, with a focus on problems in
computational biology. The backbone of our tools is a new measure of
discrepancy between the true conditional distribution and the model's estimate,
called the Augmented Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ACMMD). Provided
that the model can be sampled from, the ACMMD can be estimated unbiasedly from
data to quantify absolute model fit, integrated within hypothesis tests, and
used to evaluate model reliability. We demonstrate the utility of our approach
by analyzing a popular protein design model, ProteinMPNN. We are able to reject
the hypothesis that ProteinMPNN fits its data for various protein families, and
tune the model's temperature hyperparameter to achieve a better fit.

Motivation: 探索用不同方法学习解纠缠表示，传统单VAE用连续潜空间，本文尝试用离散潜变量组合各源的VAE表示。

Method: 定义多流变分自编码器（MS - VAE）方法，推导其推理和学习方程，用线性组合模型进行源组合。

Result: 在手写数字分离中能清晰分离数字，在说话人分割任务中漏检说话人率低，在不同监督和训练数据量下灵活性高。

Conclusion: MS - VAE方法可行，能有效分离源，且具有灵活性和领域无关性。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a leading approach to address the problem
of learning disentangled representations. Typically a single VAE is used and
disentangled representations are sought in its continuous latent space. Here we
explore a different approach by using discrete latents to combine
VAE-representations of individual sources. The combination is done based on an
explicit model for source combination, and we here use a linear combination
model which is well suited, e.g., for acoustic data. We formally define such a
multi-stream VAE (MS-VAE) approach, derive its inference and learning
equations, and we numerically investigate its principled functionality. The
MS-VAE is domain-agnostic, and we here explore its ability to separate sources
into different streams using superimposed hand-written digits, and mixed
acoustic sources in a speaker diarization task. We observe a clear separation
of digits, and on speaker diarization we observe an especially low rate of
missed speakers. Numerical experiments further highlight the flexibility of the
approach across varying amounts of supervision and training data.

Motivation: 现有等变神经网络通用性结果稀缺且多在受限环境下成立，需更通用的理论。

Method: 为不变网络在分离约束下建立通用性定理，为等变网络引入更严格的逐元素可分性标准。

Result: 不变网络添加全连接读出层可在分离约束连续函数类中实现逼近；等变网络在足够深度或添加适当读出层时在逐元素可分体系中实现通用性。

Conclusion: 深度和读出层是实现通用性的决定性机制，统一并拓展了早期专门结果。

Abstract: Universality results for equivariant neural networks remain rare. Those that
do exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on
regular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically
high-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often
confined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account.
For invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation
constraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer
secures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous
functions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we
demonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the
sharper criterion of $\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with
sufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers,
equivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable
regime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for
shallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive
mechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that
subsumes and extends earlier specialized results.

Result: 建立了组合分数均方误差关于个体分数误差和观测数量的上限。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become a widely used framework in
applied sciences for estimating the parameters of stochastic models that best
explain experimental observations. A central question in this setting is how to
effectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter
inference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in
score-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a
compositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within
the diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of
individual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of
observations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained
unexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the
GAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its
mean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number
of observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example,
where all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form.

Abstract: We study conformal inference in non-exchangeable environments through the
lens of Blackwell's theory of approachability. We first recast adaptive
conformal inference (ACI, Gibbs and Cand\`es, 2021) as a repeated two-player
vector-valued finite game and characterize attainable coverage--efficiency
tradeoffs. We then construct coverage and efficiency objectives under potential
restrictions on the adversary's play, and design a calibration-based
approachability strategy to achieve these goals. The resulting algorithm enjoys
strong theoretical guarantees and provides practical insights, though its
computational burden may limit deployment in practice.

Abstract: A MICRO 2024 best paper runner-up publication (the Mess paper) with all three
artifact badges awarded (including "Reproducible") proposes a new benchmark to
evaluate real and simulated memory system performance. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the Ramulator 2.0 simulation results reported in the Mess
paper are incorrect and, at the time of the publication of the Mess paper,
irreproducible. We find that the authors of Mess paper made multiple trivial
human errors in both the configuration and usage of the simulators. We show
that by correctly configuring Ramulator 2.0, Ramulator 2.0's simulated memory
system performance actually resembles real system characteristics well, and
thus a key claimed contribution of the Mess paper is factually incorrect. We
also identify that the DAMOV simulation results in the Mess paper use wrong
simulation statistics that are unrelated to the simulated DRAM performance.
Moreover, the Mess paper's artifact repository lacks the necessary sources to
fully reproduce all the Mess paper's results.
  Our work corrects the Mess paper's errors regarding Ramulator 2.0 and
identifies important issues in the Mess paper's memory simulator evaluation
methodology. We emphasize the importance of both carefully and rigorously
validating simulation results and contacting simulator authors and developers,
in true open source spirit, to ensure these simulators are used with correct
configurations and as intended. We encourage the computer architecture
community to correct the Mess paper's errors. This is necessary to prevent the
propagation of inaccurate and misleading results, and to maintain the
reliability of the scientific record. Our investigation also opens up questions
about the integrity of the review and artifact evaluation processes. To aid
future work, our source code and scripts are openly available at https:

Conclusion: 通过建模开发者对竞争和监管压力的战略反应，为复杂多变的基础模型生态系统提供分析竞争和设计有效政策的可靠框架。

Abstract: The strategic choice of model "openness" has become a defining issue for the
foundation model (FM) ecosystem. While this choice is intensely debated, its
underlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period
game-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value
chain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant
developer. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to
the entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a "data
flywheel effect," whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the
deployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's
optimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of
the data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very
strong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an
intermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's
learning. This dynamic gives rise to an "openness trap," a critical policy
paradox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic
flexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to
show that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical
integration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel
effect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient
competitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be
captured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness
adjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the
developer's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we
provide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective
policy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem.

Conclusion: 数值结果为考虑性能 - 电路复杂度权衡的非理想BD - RIS部署提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has recently been
introduced to enable advanced control over electromagnetic waves to further
increase the benefits of traditional RIS in enhancing signal quality and
improving spectral and energy efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.
A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between
its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring
optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS,
architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore,
how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of
BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance -
circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially,
architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the
computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in
achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of
an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover
optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities,
which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding
getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions
for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights
for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity
tradeoff.

Motivation: 研究带字典序成本的优化问题中局部最优解查找的难度，回答Scheder和Tantow提出的关于置换群作用下字符串字典序局部最小问题在置换可交换等特定条件下是否仍为PLS完全的疑问。

Method: 通过分析不同优化问题，如Max - Cut、4 - CNF和3 - CNF公式，证明其PLS完全性，并利用这些结果解决置换群相关问题。

Result: 证明了带字典序成本的4 - CNF公式局部最大赋值是PLS完全的，3 - CNF在特定放松条件下也是PLS完全的；证明了置换可交换、群元素阶为2以及群为循环群时，字符串字典序局部最小问题仍为PLS完全。

Conclusion: 在带字典序成本的优化问题中，局部最优解查找通常是困难的（PLS完全），并且在置换群作用下的相关问题在特定条件下仍保持PLS完全性。

Abstract: How hard is it to find a local optimum? If we are given a graph and want to
find a locally maximal cut--meaning that the number of edges in the cut cannot
be improved by moving a single vertex from one side to the other--then just
iterating improving steps finds a local maximum since the size of the cut can
increase at most $|E|$ times. If, on the other hand, the edges are weighted,
this problem becomes hard for the class PLS (Polynomial Local Search)[16].
  We are interested in optimization problems with lexicographic costs. For
Max-Cut this would mean that the edges $e_1,\dots, e_m$ have costs $c(e_i) =
2^{m-i}$. For such a cost function, it is easy to see that finding a global
Max-Cut is easy. In contrast, we show that it is PLS-complete to find an
assignment for a 4-CNF formula that is locally maximal (when the clauses have
lexicographic weights); and also for a 3-CNF when we relax the notion of local
by allowing to switch two variables at a time.
  We use these results to answer a question in Scheder and Tantow[15], who
showed that finding a lexicographic local minimum of a string $s \in \{0,1\}^n$
under the action of a list of given permutations $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k \in
S_{n}$ is PLS-complete. They ask whether the problem stays PLS-complete when
the $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_k$ commute, i.e., generate an Abelian subgroup $G$ of
$S_n$. In this work, we show that it does, and in fact stays PLS-complete even
(1) when every element in $G$ has order two and also (2) when $G$ is cyclic,
i.e., all $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_k$ are powers of a single permutations $\pi$.

Abstract: Speech disorders can significantly affect the patients capability to
communicate, learn, and socialize. However, existing speech therapy solutions
(e.g., therapist or tools) are still limited and costly, hence such solutions
remain inadequate for serving millions of patients worldwide. To address this,
state-of-the-art methods employ neural network (NN) algorithms to help
accurately detecting speech disorders. However, these methods do not provide
therapy recommendation as feedback, hence providing partial solution for
patients. Moreover, these methods incur high energy consumption due to their
complex and resource-intensive NN processing, hence hindering their deployments
on low-power/energy platforms (e.g., smartphones). Toward this, we propose
SpikeVox, a novel framework for enabling energy-efficient speech therapy
solutions through spike-driven generative language model. Specifically,
SpikeVox employs a speech recognition module to perform highly accurate
speech-to-text conversion; leverages a spike-driven generative language model
to efficiently perform pattern analysis for speech disorder detection and
generates suitable exercises for therapy; provides guidance on correct
pronunciation as feedback; as well as utilizes the REST API to enable seamless
interaction for users. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeVox achieves
88% confidence level on average in speech disorder recognition, while providing
a complete feedback for therapy exercises. Therefore, SpikeVox provides a
comprehensive framework for energy-efficient speech therapy solutions, and
potentially addresses the significant global speech therapy access gap.

TL;DR: 本文介绍美国能源部EEIO - IDA模型的新物理扩展，产生物理和环境双扩展模型，完成物质流数据集，可量化各工业子部门环境影响强度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物质流物理评估对制定可持续脱碳和循环战略有支持作用，但因高质量原始数据稀缺和行业分类系统缺乏协调，完成评估具有挑战性。

Method: 将美国经济分为商品生产和服务生产子部门，结合贸易数据和物理生产数据量化商品生产子部门的物质流；针对数据缺失情况，开发价格估算和质量平衡假设以完成物质流数据集。

Result: 得到的数据集与EEIO - IDA工具集成后，可按质量基础量化各工业子部门的环境影响强度指标。

Conclusion: 该工作与美国能源部现有框架和工具相契合，有助于推动相关研究和战略制定。

Abstract: A physical assessment of material flows in an economy (e.g., material flow
quantification) can support the development of sustainable decarbonization and
circularity strategies by providing the tangible physical context of industrial
production quantities and supply chain relationships. However, completing a
physical assessment is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality raw data
and poor harmonization across industry classification systems used in data
reporting. Here we describe a new physical extension for the U.S. Department of
Energy's (DOE's) EEIO for Industrial Decarbonization (EEIO-IDA) model, yielding
an expanded EEIO model that is both physically and environmentally extended. In
the model framework, the U.S. economy is divided into goods-producing and
service-producing subsectors, and mass flows are quantified for each
goods-producing subsector using a combination of trade data (e.g., UN Comtrade)
and physical production data (e.g., U.S. Geological Survey). Given that
primary-source production data are not available for all subsectors,
price-imputation and mass-balance assumptions are developed and used to
complete the physical flows dataset with high-quality estimations. The
resulting dataset, when integrated with the EEIO-IDA tool, enables the
quantification of environmental impact intensity metrics on a mass basis (e.g.,
CO$_2$eq/kg)) for each industrial subsector. This work is designed to align
with existing DOE frameworks and tools, including the EEIO-IDA tool, the DOE
Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap (2022), and Pathways for U.S. Industrial
Transformations study (2025).

Result: 试卷交换惩罚比传统惩罚威慑力更强，纳什均衡分析显示相互备考是占优策略。

Conclusion: 创造相互脆弱性的非常规惩罚机制比传统个人惩罚更有效，还提议未来进行实证验证和行为实验。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel game theoretic framework for analyzing academic
dishonesty through the lens of a unique deterrent mechanism: forced exam script
swapping between students caught copying. We model the strategic interactions
between students as a non cooperative game with asymmetric information and
examine three base scenarios asymmetric preparation levels, mutual non
preparation, and coordinated partial preparation. Our analysis reveals that the
script swapping punishment creates a stronger deterrent effect than traditional
penalties by introducing strategic interdependence in outcomes. The Nash
equilibrium analysis demonstrates that mutual preparation emerges as the
dominant strategy. The framework provides insights for institutional policy
design, suggesting that unconventional punishment mechanisms that create mutual
vulnerability can be more effective than traditional individual penalties.
Future empirical validation and behavioral experiments are proposed to test the
model predictions, including explorations of tapering off effects in punishment
severity over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究因国际移民产生的有移民的家庭与非移民家庭相比，是否有更高消费支出和更好的饮食多样性。

Method: 采用普通最小二乘法和工具变量法。

Result: 移民家庭总体消费支出和食品支出更高，国际移民增加了留守家庭饮食多样性，移民家庭在蛋白质和不健康食品上支出更多。

Conclusion: 国际移民对留守家庭的食物消费和饮食多样性有显著影响。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the impact of international migration on the food
consumption and dietary diversity of left-behind households. Using the Kerala
migration survey 2011, we study whether households with emigrants (on account
of international migration) have higher consumption expenditure and improved
dietary diversity than their non-migrating counterparts. We use ordinary least
square and instrumental variable approach to answer this question. The key
findings are that: a) emigrant households have higher overall consumption
expenditure as well as higher expenditure on food; b) we find that
international migration leads to increase in the dietary diversity of left
behind households. Further, we explore the effect on food sub-group expenditure
for both rural and urban households. We find that emigrant households spend
more on protein (milk, pulses and egg, fish and meat), at the same time there
is higher spending on non-healthy food habits (processed and ready to eat food
items) among them.

Result: 三分制规则变更提高了英足总联赛的竞争平衡，且场均进球数无显著变化。

Conclusion: 三分制规则变更对英足总联赛竞争平衡有积极影响，不影响场均进球数。

Abstract: Governing authorities in sports often make changes to rules and regulations
to increase competitiveness. One such change was made by the English Football
Association in 1981 when it changed the rule for awarding points in the
domestic league from two points for a win to three points. This study aims to
measure this rule change's impact on the domestic league's competitive balance
using a quasi-experimental estimation design of a synthetic control method. The
three-point rule change led to an increase in competitive balance in the
English League. Further, we show no significant change in the number of goals
scored per match.

Motivation: 研究印度内部移民中教育职业不匹配的发生率、教育回报以及考虑移民间异质性的情况。

Method: 使用印度全国代表性数据进行分析，考虑因迁移原因、人口特征、空间因素、迁移经验和迁移类型产生的异质性。

Result: 教育职业不匹配的发生率和回报因迁移原因、人口特征和空间因素存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要关注教育职业不匹配以增加移民的生产力收益，提供了减少移民不匹配可能性并最大化教育回报的框架。

Abstract: Using nationally representative data for India, this paper examines the
incidence of education occupation mismatch and returns to education and EOM for
internal migrants while considering the heterogeneity among them. In
particular, this study considers heterogeneity arising because of the reason to
migrate, demographic characteristics, spatial factors, migration experience,
and type of migration. The analysis reveals that there exists variation in the
incidence and returns to EOM depending on the reason to migrate, demographic
characteristics, and spatial factors. The study highlights the need of focusing
on EOM to increase the productivity benefits of migration. It also provides the
framework for minimizing migrants' likelihood of being mismatched while
maximizing their returns to education.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一次性塑料造成巨大环境成本，奥地利和德国引入相关费用，研究这些成本对消费者价格的推动程度。

Method: 使用包含价格的高频零售报价面板数据，采用固定效应事件研究法和双向聚类标准误。

Result: 奥地利有明确的价格传导，合并奥地利产品时，处理品在十二个月内比非一次性塑料对照品高13.01指数点，整个后期高19.42点；气球有强烈持久影响，杯子短期表现不一，全期有正向但不精确的差异。

Conclusion: 奥地利对一次性塑料的费用政策导致了明显的价格传导至消费者。

Abstract: Single-use plastics (SUPs) create large environmental costs. After Directive
(EU) 2019/904, Austria and Germany introduced producer charges and fund
payments meant to cover clean-up work. Using a high-frequency panel of retail
offer spells containing prices and a fixed-effects event study with two-way
clustered standard errors, this paper measures how much these costs drive up
consumer prices. We find clear price pass-through in Austria. When Austrian
products are pooled, treated items are 13.01 index points higher than non-SUP
controls within twelve months (DiD(12m); p<0.001) and 19.42 points over the
full post period (p<0.001). By product, balloons show strong and lasting
effects (DiD(12m)=13.43, p=0.007; Full DiD=19.96, p<0.001). Cups show mixed
short-run movements (e.g., DiD(12m)=-22.73, p=0.096) and a positive but
imprecise full-period contrast.

Result: 得到了对成功概率依赖性有所改善的量子最坏情况到平均情况的归约。

Conclusion: 新归约方法更高效、概念更简单，为量子精细复杂度的广泛应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Worst-case to average-case reductions are a cornerstone of complexity theory,
providing a bridge between worst-case hardness and average-case computational
difficulty. While recent works have demonstrated such reductions for
fundamental problems using deep tools from ad- ditive combinatorics, these
approaches often suffer from substantial complexity and suboptimal overheads.
In this work, we focus on the quantum setting, and provide a new reduction for
the Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem that is more efficient, and
conceptually simpler than previous constructions. By adapting hardness
self-amplification techniques to the quantum do- main, we obtain a quantum
worst-case to average-case reduction with improved dependence on the success
probability, laying the groundwork for broader applications in quantum
fine-grained complexity.

Result: 数值模拟实现不同目标的高保真态制备，产生平滑、硬件可行的控制场。

Conclusion: 该无奇异框架扩展了基于不变量的控制，为NISQ硬件等平台的量子态工程提供通用途径。

Abstract: State preparation is a cornerstone of quantum technologies, underpinning
applications in computation, communication, and sensing. Its importance becomes
even more pronounced in non-Markovian open quantum systems, where environmental
memory and model uncertainties pose significant challenges to achieving
high-fidelity control. Invariant-based inverse engineering provides a
principled framework for synthesizing analytic control fields, yet existing
parameterizations often lead to experimentally infeasible, singular pulses and
are limited to simplified noise models such as those of Lindblad form. Here, we
introduce a generalized invariant-based protocol for single-qubit state
preparation under arbitrary noise conditions. The control proceeds in
two-stages: first, we construct a family of bounded pulses that achieve perfect
state preparation in a closed system; second, we identify the optimal member of
this family that minimizes the effect of noise. The framework accommodates both
(i) characterized noise, enabling noise-aware control synthesis, and (ii)
uncharacterized noise, where a noise-agnostic variant preserves robustness
without requiring a master-equation description. Numerical simulations
demonstrate high-fidelity state preparation across diverse targets while
producing smooth, hardware-feasible control fields. This singularity-free
framework extends invariant-based control to realistic open-system regimes,
providing a versatile route toward robust quantum state engineering on NISQ
hardware and other platforms exhibiting non-Markovian dynamics.

Method: 开发基于角色条件的LLM代理“Sparks”，采用以LLM为评判者并对照人类黄金标准的实验协议。

Abstract: Creative services teams increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to
accelerate ideation, yet production systems often converge on homogeneous

persona-conditioned LLM agents -- internally branded as "Sparks" and
instantiated through a library of role-inspired system prompts -- to
intentionally diversify agent behaviour within a multi-agent workflow. This
white paper documents the problem framing, experimental design, and
quantitative evidence behind the Spark agent programme. Using an LLM-as-a-judge
protocol calibrated against human gold standards, we observe a mean diversity
gain of +4.1 points (on a 1-10 scale) when persona-conditioned Spark agents
replace a uniform system prompt, narrowing the gap to human experts to 1.0
point. We also surface evaluator bias and procedural considerations for future
deployments.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the minimisation problem of submodular functions and investigate
the application of a zeroth-order method to this problem. The method is based
on exploiting a Gaussian smoothing random oracle to estimate the smoothed
function gradient. We prove the convergence of the algorithm to a global
$\epsilon$-approximate solution in the offline case and show that the algorithm
is Hannan-consistent in the online case with respect to static regret.
Moreover, we show that the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{NP_N^\ast})$ dynamic
regret, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $P_N^\ast$ is the path
length. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for
all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.

Motivation: 解决贝叶斯优化在高维问题中的可扩展性挑战。

Method: 采用变分自编码器（VAEs）进行潜在空间贝叶斯优化（LSBO），结合顺序域缩减（SDR）提出SDR - LSBO算法，在GPU加速的BoTorch栈中实现。

Result: 数值结果显示在基准任务中优化质量提高，结构化潜在流形提升BO性能，VAE降维优于随机嵌入。

Conclusion: 这是首次将SDR与基于VAE的LSBO结合的研究，明确了可扩展潜在空间BO中度量塑造和再训练的设计选择。

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a standard approach for sample-efficient global
optimisation of expensive black-box functions, yet its scalability to high
dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality
reduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional
Latent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random
projections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al. (2021), we employ
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for LSBO, focusing on deep metric loss for
structured latent manifolds and VAE retraining to adapt the encoder-decoder to
newly sampled regions. We propose some changes in their implementation,
originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the
algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with
Sequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO),
yielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence
accumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2
Gaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation
quality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO
performance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two
mechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine
SDR with VAE-based LSBO, and our analysis clarifies design choices for metric
shaping and retraining that are critical for scalable latent space BO. For
reproducibility, our source code is available at

Motivation: 研究随机搜索在仅有噪声函数评估情况下的表现，在不同平滑假设下挖掘其潜力，并改进有限和场景下的收敛速度。

Method: 利用简单的平移不变性属性，在有限和场景设计方差缩减变体。

Result: 随机搜索在比以往更弱的平滑假设下可行，更强假设能带来更好保证；有限和场景下的变体可加速收敛。

Conclusion: 平移不变性属性为平衡噪声和降低方差提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: We revisit random search for stochastic optimization, where only noisy
function evaluations are available. We show that the method works under weaker
smoothness assumptions than previously considered, and that stronger
assumptions enable improved guarantees. In the finite-sum setting, we design a
variance-reduced variant that leverages multiple samples to accelerate
convergence. Our analysis relies on a simple translation invariance property,

Result: 方法有强收敛保证，有可证明的时钟加速效果，实验中优于基线并保持二阶精度。

Conclusion: 异步曲率计算方法有实用意义，在性能上有显著提升。

Abstract: Second-order methods promise faster convergence but are rarely used in
practice because Hessian computations and decompositions are far more expensive
than gradients. We propose a \emph{split-client} framework where gradients and
curvature are computed asynchronously by separate clients. This abstraction
captures realistic delays and inexact Hessian updates while avoiding the manual
tuning required by Lazy Hessian methods. Focusing on cubic regularization, we
show that our approach retains strong convergence guarantees and achieves a
provable wall-clock speedup of order $\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the
relative time needed to compute and decompose the Hessian compared to a
gradient step. Since $\tau$ can be orders of magnitude larger than one in
high-dimensional problems, this improvement is practically significant.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the theory: asynchronous
curvature consistently outperforms vanilla and Lazy Hessian baselines, while
maintaining second-order accuracy.

Abstract: An adaptive Cook's distance (ACD) for diagnosing influential observations in
high-dimensional single-index models with multicollinearity and outlier
contamination is proposed. ACD is a model-free technique built on sparse local
linear gradients to temper leverage effects. In simulations spanning low- and
high-dimensional design settings with strong correlation, ACD based on LASSO
(ACD-LASSO) and SCAD (ACD-SCAD) penalties reduced masking and swamping relative
to classical Cook's distance and local influence as well as the DF-Model and
Case-Weight adjusted solution for LASSO. Trimming points flagged by ACD
stabilizes variable selection while preserving core signals. Applications to
two datasets--the 1960 US cities pollution study and a high-dimensional
riboflavin genomics experiment show consistent gains in selection stability and
interpretability.

Conclusion: 相比 ICH E9(R1)，本文在估计目标定义、方法利用协变量和估计量讨论上具有创新性。

Abstract: The ICH E9(R1) guideline presents a framework of estimand for clinical
trials, proposes five strategies for handling intercurrent events (ICEs), and
provides a comprehensive discussion and many real-life clinical examples for
quantitative outcomes and categorical outcomes. However, in ICH E9(R1) the
discussion is lacking for time-to-event (TTE) outcomes. In this paper, we
discuss how to define estimands and how to handle ICEs for clinical trials with
TTE outcomes. Specifically, we discuss six ICE handling strategies, including
those five strategies proposed by ICH E9(R1) and a new strategy, the
competing-risk strategy. Compared with ICH E9(R1), the novelty of this paper is
three-fold: (1) the estimands are defined in terms of potential outcomes, (2)
the methods can utilize time-dependent covariates straightforwardly, and (3)
the efficient estimators are discussed accordingly.

Conclusion: B - ODIL能有效解决基于PDE的逆问题，并对解的不确定性进行量化。

Abstract: Inverse problems are crucial for many applications in science, engineering
and medicine that involve data assimilation, design, and imaging. Their
solution infers the parameters or latent states of a complex system from noisy
data and partially observable processes. When measurements are an incomplete or
indirect view of the system, additional knowledge is required to accurately
solve the inverse problem. Adopting a physical model of the system in the form
of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a potent method to close this gap.
In particular, the method of optimizing a discrete loss (ODIL) has shown great
potential in terms of robustness and computational cost. In this work, we
introduce B-ODIL, a Bayesian extension of ODIL, that integrates the PDE loss of
ODIL as prior knowledge and combines it with a likelihood describing the data.
B-ODIL employs a Bayesian formulation of PDE-based inverse problems to infer
solutions with quantified uncertainties. We demonstrate the capabilities of

TL;DR: 本文针对分布式联邦学习（DFL）在车联网中易受网络攻击的问题，设计攻击、分析其抵御能力并提出防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴网络系统中，传统联邦学习依赖中心服务器有局限性，DFL虽有优势但易受网络攻击，需研究其漏洞及防御方法。

Method: 设计针对性训练数据投毒和后门攻击，分析DFL在车联网中的新兴漏洞，对比DFL与个体学习抵御攻击的能力。

Result: 分析了DFL相比个体学习抵御攻击的能力。

Conclusion: 提出有效防御机制，进一步增强DFL抵御新兴网络威胁的能力。

Abstract: In emerging networked systems, mobile edge devices such as ground vehicles
and unmanned aerial system (UAS) swarms collectively aggregate vast amounts of
data to make machine learning decisions such as threat detection in remote,
dynamic, and infrastructure-constrained environments where power and bandwidth
are scarce. Federated learning (FL) addresses these constraints and privacy
concerns by enabling nodes to share local model weights for deep neural
networks instead of raw data, facilitating more reliable decision-making than
individual learning. However, conventional FL relies on a central server to
coordinate model updates in each learning round, which imposes significant
computational burdens on the central node and may not be feasible due to the
connectivity constraints. By eliminating dependence on a central server,
distributed federated learning (DFL) offers scalability, resilience to node
failures, learning robustness, and more effective defense strategies. Despite
these advantages, DFL remains vulnerable to increasingly advanced and stealthy
cyberattacks. In this paper, we design sophisticated targeted training data
poisoning and backdoor (Trojan) attacks, and characterize the emerging
vulnerabilities in a vehicular network. We analyze how DFL provides resilience
against such attacks compared to individual learning and present effective
defense mechanisms to further strengthen DFL against the emerging cyber
threats.

TL;DR: 提出DroneAudioset数据集，用于无人机听觉系统开发和评估，推动其设计与部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机视觉检测方法在低能见度或遮挡下易失效，音频感知有前景但受自身噪音干扰，且缺乏多样化真实数据集和标准化设置。

Method: 创建DroneAudioset数据集，包含23.5小时标注录音，覆盖多种信噪比、无人机类型、油门、麦克风配置和环境。

Result: 该数据集可用于开发和评估噪声抑制与分类方法，为无人机听觉系统设计提供参考。

Conclusion: 此数据集是推动无人机听觉系统设计和部署的重要一步。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, are increasingly used in search
and rescue missions to detect human presence. Existing systems primarily
leverage vision-based methods which are prone to fail under low-visibility or
occlusion. Drone-based audio perception offers promise but suffers from extreme
ego-noise that masks sounds indicating human presence. Existing datasets are
either limited in diversity or synthetic, lacking real acoustic interactions,
and there are no standardized setups for drone audition. To this end, we
present DroneAudioset (The dataset is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ahlab-drone-project/DroneAudioSet/ under the
MIT license), a comprehensive drone audition dataset featuring 23.5 hours of
annotated recordings, covering a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
from -57.2 dB to -2.5 dB, across various drone types, throttles, microphone
configurations as well as environments. The dataset enables development and
systematic evaluation of noise suppression and classification methods for
human-presence detection under challenging conditions, while also informing
practical design considerations for drone audition systems, such as microphone
placement trade-offs, and development of drone noise-aware audio processing.
This dataset is an important step towards enabling design and deployment of
drone-audition systems.

### [225] [Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116)
*Sarod Yatawatta*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文聚焦于不通过成像进行低成本波达方向（DOA）估计，利用射电干涉阵列子集和部分数据，适用于瞬态和低占空比源检测，也是射频干扰（RFI）缓解后的理想后续步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DOA估计需专门阵列，利用现有射电干涉阵列进行DOA估计除成像外不可行，故需低成本且无需成像的DOA估计方法。

Method: 使用射电干涉阵列的子集和部分数据进行低成像的DOA估计。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于瞬态和低占空比源检测，是RFI缓解后的理想后续步骤，可实现早期DOA估计。

Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized
arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the
operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are
designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality
images of the sky.
  Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary
geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically
infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper,
we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio
interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full
array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is
suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the
proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency
interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the
detected RFI.

Motivation: 下一代射电干涉（RI）望远镜需要能从大体积宽频带数据生成高分辨率、高动态范围图像的成像算法，当前AIRI仅适用于单色RI成像，因此需进行高光谱扩展。

Conclusion: HyperAIRI在高光谱RI成像中具有优越性能，能满足下一代RI望远镜的成像需求。

Abstract: The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging
algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from
large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a
plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure
(FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging
by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned
denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension,
underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral
model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its
current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring
channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated
denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained
with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate
varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each
tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral
channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using
dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are
also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability
to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a
variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity
across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate
HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its
superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart
Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic
imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited
acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional
swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper presents NOAH, a novel
nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift,
irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based
communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH
addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing
hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based
communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The
algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and
energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.
Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring
scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and
irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.

Conclusion: ASBI框架能有效解决黑盒模拟器参数估计问题，实现准确的参数调优。

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习中基于视觉运动的扩散策略学习多依赖点云输入，缺乏对纯视觉方案的深入探索，而纯视觉方案有巨大潜力。

Method: 提出VO - DP方法，利用预训练视觉基础模型融合语义和几何特征，通过交叉注意力融合特征并经CNN空间压缩后输入策略头。

Conclusion: VO - DP方法有效，同时开源了支持多机多GPU并行训练等的机器人操作训练库。

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

an actuated MANO hand in physics simulation, reproducing human demonstrations
while discovering the underlying contact forces that generate the observed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理受限于有限的领域知识访问，传统RAG系统基于非结构化文本，信息密度低、推理效果不佳。

Method: 提出Structure - R1框架，利用强化学习学习内容表示策略，动态生成和调整结构格式，引入自奖励结构验证机制。

Result: 在七个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模骨干模型的Structure - R1表现有竞争力，可媲美更大模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示通过提高信息密度和上下文清晰度增强推理，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是使用MLLMs作为统一编码器时，实现鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著超越GPT - 4o和DeepSeek等先进基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确可靠地评估大语言模型生成内容的多标签毒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

TL;DR: 研究稀疏参数更新能否实现无灾难性遗忘的持续学习，提出稀疏内存微调方法，实验表明该方法学习新知识时遗忘更少，为大模型持续学习提供新路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常静态，持续学习的主要障碍是灾难性遗忘，因可训练参数跨任务共享，缓解遗忘有挑战，故研究稀疏参数更新。

Method: 引入稀疏内存微调，利用内存层模型，仅更新被新知识高度激活的内存槽以减少干扰。

Result: 在两个问答任务上评估，稀疏内存微调学习新知识时遗忘大幅减少，如在NaturalQuestions任务上F1值下降远低于全微调与LoRA微调。

Conclusion: 内存层的稀疏性为大语言模型的持续学习提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在政治话语塑造中重要，但分析其海量快速变化内容是挑战，需有效方法。

Method: 结合无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，无需种子集和领域专业知识。

Result: 揭示投票和移民广告占支出和曝光主导，堕胎和选举诚信广告覆盖范围大，资金模式两极分化，诉求框架有差异，主题显著性显示道德基础与议题强相关，出现人口统计定位。

Conclusion: 该工作支持社交媒体政治信息的可扩展、可解释分析，有助于相关人员理解新兴叙事、极化动态和数字政治传播的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

Result: 模型有效，生成的数据集质量高。

Conclusion: 研究成果有潜力推动选择题相关进一步研究。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

TL;DR: 提出Partial YaRN和VLAT提升大音频语言模型长音频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大音频语言模型受短音频上下文窗口限制，现有上下文扩展方法在其应用待探索。

Method: 提出免训练的音频扩展方法Partial YaRN，及训练策略VLAT将其扩展为训练时位置增强。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2 - Audio实验中，Partial YaRN表现优于原模型，VLAT策略显著提升性能。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT能有效提升大音频语言模型长音频理解能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

TL;DR: 研究探索DDLMs与ARMs的混合架构，发现从文本空间到潜在空间通信可提升准确率，组合使用能节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估DDLMs与ARMs协作能否产生互补优势。

Method: 先研究文本空间协作，再拓展到潜在空间通信，引入学习投影仪。

Result: 从文本到潜在空间通信显著提升准确率，组合使用可节省计算资源且不影响准确率。

Conclusion: 研究为DDLMs推理提供新见解，凸显其在混合架构中的潜力。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

Motivation: 现有ICD编码方法存在临床文本与ICD代码语义差距、对罕见长尾代码表现不佳和可解释性有限等问题。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合UMLS、维基百科和大语言模型等多源知识，引入混合注意力机制。

Result: 在MIMIC - III - ICD9、MIMIC - IV - ICD9和MIMIC - IV - ICD10数据集实验中达最优性能，消融实验验证组件有效性。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动ICD编码提供可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，符合临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出TACL框架处理医学文本理解难题，在多语言医疗数据多临床任务中表现良好，有统一不同医学领域方法的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学文本非结构化、语言特定且复杂多样，现有方法忽略数据复杂度差异，模型泛化和处理复杂病例能力受限。

Method: 提出TACL框架，基于渐进学习原则，根据样本复杂度动态调整训练过程，先处理简单数据再处理复杂数据。

Result: 将TACL应用于多语言医学数据，在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医综合征分化等临床任务中取得显著改进。

Conclusion: TACL增强了自动化系统性能，有统一不同医学领域方法的潜力，为医学文本理解提供更准确、可扩展和全球适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在知识图谱问答中存在的语义差距、规划不佳、探索效率低以及训练免方法未充分利用训练数据推理模式的问题。

Method: EGP 框架先对训练集问题进行实体模板预处理，用语义嵌入和 FAISS 索引检索相似问题及推理路径，分任务分解和关系探索两阶段引导 LLM 规划，关系探索时引入 Smart Lookahead 机制。

Result: 在 WebQSP 和 CWQ 两个真实世界 KGQA 数据集上实验，PoG - EGP 显著优于基线 PoG 系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP 框架有效提升了 LLM 代理在 KGQA 中的规划能力和问答效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上超越现有方法，不到1%的标记集成也能有提升。

Conclusion: SAFE框架有效且高效，能改善大语言模型集成在长文本生成的性能。

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

Conclusion: 建立了专门化医学视觉语言模型的可靠流程，验证了模型作为高质量查询生成器的能力，为增强多模态检索增强生成系统在循证临床决策支持中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

Method: 建立DeceptionBench基准，涵盖150个场景、超1000个样本，从静态计数、内在维度、外在维度分析，引入多轮交互。

Result: 实验揭示大模型存在关键漏洞，强化动态下欺骗性增强。

Conclusion: 当前模型缺乏对操纵性上下文线索的强大抵抗力，急需针对欺骗行为的高级防护措施。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available

Conclusion: 该工作实现了通用的草稿模型选择方法，使推测解码成为更通用实用的大语言模型加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

TL;DR: 提出ParallaxRAG框架解决大语言模型多跳推理问题，实验有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常产生幻觉且多跳推理能力不足，现有知识图谱检索增强生成方法有缺陷。

Method: 提出ParallaxRAG框架，将查询和图三元组解耦到多视图空间，利用注意力头在不同推理阶段的专业化特性构建更清晰子图。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ上实验，有竞争力的检索和问答性能，减少幻觉，泛化性好。

Conclusion: 多视图头专业化是知识驱动多跳推理的可行方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估多针对英语，韩语因独特语法等特点缺乏评估开放式指令跟随能力的专用基准。

Method: 引入Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE)基准评估通用和韩语特定指令，评估流程结合自动指标和人工评估。

Result: 揭示了不同模型间的性能差异，深入了解了模型优缺点。

Conclusion: 公开KITE数据集和代码，有助于促进文化和语言包容性的大语言模型开发，启发对其他代表性不足语言的类似研究。

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Result: DLMs有注意力下沉现象，下沉位置动态变化，且对移除注意力下沉更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 为基于扩散的语言模型内部机制提供新见解，凸显其与自回归模型在注意力分配和使用上的根本差异。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Conclusion: 该工作首次联合整合互评、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证来评估大语言模型能力。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在奖励模糊、主观或依赖上下文的开放式领域，如医疗咨询，缺乏强大的奖励函数，现有强化学习策略面临挑战，需要新方法解决。

Method: 引入ORBIT框架，将合成对话生成与动态创建评分标准相结合，利用评分标准指导增量强化学习过程，不依赖外部医学知识或手动规则，通过评分标准反馈引导学习。

Result: 在Qwen3 - 4B - Instruct模型上，使用2k样本使HealthBench - Hard基准测试成绩从7.0提升到27.2，达到该规模模型的最优结果。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的强化学习能在不同咨询场景中持续提升性能，基于评分标准的反馈是推进大语言模型处理复杂开放式任务的可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: 分离技能目标和执行是开发能在开放网络持续学习和泛化的自主代理的关键一步，为构建自适应环境中持续学习的代理提供了实践路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

Conclusion: 在足够复杂语言的翻译评估中，仅通过英语输出评估翻译器是可行的，早期翻译学习可能无需互动。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

Conclusion: ProofBridge框架在自然语言到形式语言的翻译任务中表现出色，能有效提升证明自动形式化的效果。

Abstract: Translating human-written mathematical theorems and proofs from natural
language (NL) into formal languages (FLs) like Lean 4 has long been a
significant challenge for AI. Most state-of-the-art methods address this
separately, first translating theorems and then generating proofs, creating a
fundamental disconnect vis-a-vis true proof auto-formalization. This two-step
process and its limitations were evident even in AlphaProof's silver-medal
performance at the 2024 IMO, where problem statements needed manual translation
before automated proof synthesis.
  We present ProofBridge, a unified framework for automatically translating
entire NL theorems and proofs into Lean 4. At its core is a joint embedding
model that aligns NL and FL (NL-FL) theorem-proof pairs in a shared semantic
space, enabling cross-modal retrieval of semantically relevant FL examples to
guide translation. Our training ensures that NL-FL theorems (and their proofs)
are mapped close together in this space if and only if the NL-FL pairs are
semantically equivalent. ProofBridge integrates retrieval-augmented fine-tuning
with iterative proof repair, leveraging Lean's type checker and semantic
equivalence feedback to ensure both syntactic correctness and semantic
fidelity. Experiments show substantial improvements in proof auto-formalization
over strong baselines (including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5, Kimina-Prover,
DeepSeek-Prover), with our retrieval-augmented approach yielding significant
gains in semantic correctness (SC, via proving bi-directional equivalence) and
type correctness (TC, via type-checking theorem+proof) across pass@k metrics on
miniF2F-Test-PF, a dataset we curated. In particular, ProofBridge improves
cross-modal retrieval quality by up to 3.28x Recall@1 over all-MiniLM-L6-v2,
and achieves +31.14% SC and +1.64% TC (pass@32) compared to the baseline
Kimina-Prover-RL-1.7B.

Abstract: Grassroots platforms are distributed applications run by\linebreak

grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots

  Grassroots platforms have yet to be implemented, the key challenge being
faulty and malicious participants: without secure programming support, correct
participants cannot reliably identify each other, establish secure
communication, or verify each other's code integrity.
  We present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a secure, multiagent, concurrent,
logic programming language for implementing grassroots platforms. GLP extends
logic programs with paired single-reader/single-writer (SRSW) logic variables,
providing secure communication channels among cryptographically-identified
people through encrypted, signed and attested messages, which enable identity
and code integrity verification. We present GLP progressively: logic programs,
concurrent GLP, multiagent GLP, augmenting it with cryptographic security, and
providing smartphone implementation-ready specifications. We prove safety
properties including that GLP computations are deductions, SRSW preservation,
acyclicity, and monotonicity. We prove multiagent GLP is grassroots and that
GLP streams achieve blockchain security properties. We present a grassroots
social graph protocol establishing authenticated peer-to-peer connections and
demonstrate secure grassroots social networking applications.

Conclusion: 依文献制定路线图可帮助非政府组织克服采用障碍，提高效能、参与度和社会影响力。

Abstract: AI has the potential to significantly improve how NGOs utilize their limited
resources for societal benefits, but evidence about how NGOs adopt AI remains
scattered. In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI
adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions,
contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the
existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in
NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the
PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with
regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final
literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we
identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity,
Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common
challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE)
framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel
understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges
to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while
AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger
organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can
help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving
effectiveness, engagement, and social impact.

Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental
Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental
health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by
best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully
automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model
simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot
under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined
risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a
judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the
chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each
conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by
mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients
and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have
conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using
initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design
development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and
iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from
the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a powerful means of capturing the manifold of
realistic protein structures, enabling rapid design for protein engineering
tasks. However, existing approaches observe critical failure modes when precise
constraints are necessary for functional design. To this end, we present a
constrained diffusion framework for structure-guided protein design, ensuring
strict adherence to functional requirements while maintaining precise
stereochemical and geometric feasibility. The approach integrates proximal
feasibility updates with ADMM decomposition into the generative process,
scaling effectively to the complex constraint sets of this domain. We evaluate
on challenging protein design tasks, including motif scaffolding and
vacancy-constrained pocket design, while introducing a novel curated benchmark
dataset for motif scaffolding in the PDZ domain. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art, providing perfect satisfaction of bonding and geometric
constraints with no degradation in structural diversity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏统一多模态仿真环境限制了空地协同智能在跨域感知、通信约束下协调和联合决策优化等方面的研究。

Method: 开发TranSimHub平台，提供多视图同步渲染，支持信息交换，包含因果场景编辑器。

Result: 发布了开源的TranSimHub平台，支持现实空地交通场景下感知、融合和控制的端到端研究。

Conclusion: TranSimHub可促进空地协同智能在城市智能交通管理中的研究和发展。

Abstract: Air-ground collaborative intelligence is becoming a key approach for
next-generation urban intelligent transportation management, where aerial and
ground systems work together on perception, communication, and decision-making.
However, the lack of a unified multi-modal simulation environment has limited
progress in studying cross-domain perception, coordination under communication
constraints, and joint decision optimization. To address this gap, we present
TranSimHub, a unified simulation platform for air-ground collaborative
intelligence. TranSimHub offers synchronized multi-view rendering across RGB,
depth, and semantic segmentation modalities, ensuring consistent perception
between aerial and ground viewpoints. It also supports information exchange
between the two domains and includes a causal scene editor that enables
controllable scenario creation and counterfactual analysis under diverse
conditions such as different weather, emergency events, and dynamic obstacles.
We release TranSimHub as an open-source platform that supports end-to-end
research on perception, fusion, and control across realistic air and ground
traffic scenes. Our code is available at

*Harkaitz Goyena,Peter M. Atkinson,Unai Pérez-Goya,M. Dolores Ugarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种时空图像融合（STIF）标准化方法并比较，均提升USTFIP方法精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为方便STIF方法应用。

Method: 提出基于传统高分辨率图像上采样的方法和基于异常的卫星图像标准化（ABSIS）锐化方法。

Result: 两种方法均显著提升USTFIP方法精度，锐化方法使融合图像光谱和空间精度分别提升49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 两种标准化方法对STIF方法有积极作用，锐化方法效果更好。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BiomedXPro框架解决生物医学视觉语言模型临床应用问题，实验表明其表现优且能验证预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化技术产生不可解释的潜在向量或单一文本提示，缺乏透明度且无法捕捉临床诊断多面性，限制模型在高风险环境中的可信度。

Method: 引入BiomedXPro框架，利用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，自动生成可解释的自然语言提示对集合用于疾病诊断。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于现有提示调优方法，尤其在少样本场景；发现的提示与临床特征有强语义对齐。

Conclusion: BiomedXPro为模型预测提供可验证基础，是开发更可信、临床适配AI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究无人机视频 - 文本检索任务，提出MSAM方法，实验表明其在该任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机技术发展，视频数据量激增，急需高效语义检索，现有跨模态方法难以处理无人机视频特点，需专用检索机制。

Method: 提出Multi - Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM)方法，引入多语义自适应学习机制，结合词与视频帧细粒度交互，还有跨模态交互特征融合池化机制。

Result: 在两个自建数据集上的大量实验表明，MSAM在无人机视频 - 文本检索任务上优于其他现有方法。

Conclusion: MSAM方法有效提升了无人机视频 - 文本检索性能，源代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 现有大模态模型3D空间推理能力不确定，本文提出Spatial457数据集及评估结构，评估模型表现并发现问题，代码数据开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏全面评估6D空间推理的框架，需解决此局限。

Method: 提出Spatial457数据集，具备4种空间推理关键能力；开发级联评估结构，构建不同难度和类型问题；引入相对性能下降率（RPDR）。

Result: 评估发现模型性能随任务复杂度增加而下降，尤其是3D推理和6D空间任务；发现不同属性预测偏差。

Conclusion: 指出大模态模型在3D推理能力上存在关键弱点，数据集可用于评估和发现模型问题。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in
https://github.com/XingruiWang/Spatial457.

TL;DR: 提出MDM架构统一多模态处理，在多任务中表现出色，确立端到端多模态架构新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多模态模型中编码器和解码器分离，阻碍多模态联合表示学习，需统一多模态处理。

Method: 提出MDM架构，利用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一变分自编码器进行编码和解码。

Result: MDM在处理高维数据表现优异，在多任务中显著优于现有端到端模型，可与SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一多模态处理，兼具计算效率，为端到端多模态架构指明新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出GAZE管道自动化视频标注，提升效率与数据质量，提供世界模型训练数据生成蓝图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动标注制作世界模型训练数据集慢且贵，存在瓶颈。

Method: GAZE管道：归一化视频格式并行处理，用AI模型预标注，整合信号供人工验证。

Result: 效率提升，每审核小时节省约19分钟，减少超80%人工审核量。

Conclusion: 该方法能生成高质量、隐私感知数据集，提供可扩展蓝图。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET 临床应用受高剂量辐射限制，低剂量产生的 Poisson 噪声现有方法难处理。

Method: 提出 Poisson Consistent U - Net (PC - UNet) 模型和新的 Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC - Loss)。

Result: PC - UNet 在 PET 数据集测试中提高了物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC - UNet 能有效整合物理信息，改进图像去噪效果。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级、免优化的推理时方法DeLeaker缓解文本到图像模型语义泄漏，引入数据集SLIM和评估框架，实验表明DeLeaker效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型易出现语义泄漏问题，现有的缓解策略多基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: 提出DeLeaker方法，在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制跨实体交互并强化实体身份；引入数据集SLIM和自动评估框架。

Result: DeLeaker始终优于所有基线，即使基线有外部信息，且不影响图像保真度和质量。

Conclusion: 强调了注意力控制的价值，为更精确的文本到图像模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市AI代理训练所需的模拟场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉现实复杂性，需要更好的模拟场景。

Method: 引入UrbanVerse系统，包含UrbanVerse - 100K资产库和UrbanVerse - Gen自动管线，利用众包城市旅游视频生成场景。

Result: UrbanVerse提供160个高质量场景和10个测试场景，场景保留真实语义和布局，训练策略在模拟和零样本迁移中表现更好。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse系统有效，能为城市AI代理训练提供更好的模拟场景，提升训练策略性能。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估通用跨模态问答能力，不清楚OLLMs是否实现模态不变推理或存在模态特定偏差，需衡量跨模态一致性。

Method: 引入包含60,828道选择题的XModBench，覆盖五个任务族和六种模态组合，用于细粒度诊断。

Result: 最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在时空推理上准确率低，存在模态差异和方向不平衡。

Conclusion: 当前OLLMs远未实现真正的模态不变推理，XModBench是评估和改进跨模态能力的基础诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

Conclusion: 结合成熟模型与针对性后处理可改善图像修复效果，支持更广泛临床部署和资源节约型研究。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于VAE的潜在扩散模型存在训练效率低、推理慢和可迁移性差的问题，关键在于VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: 引入无VAE的SVG模型，利用冻结的DINO特征构建有清晰语义可区分性的特征空间，轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节，直接在语义结构化的潜在空间训练扩散模型。

Result: SVG实现加速扩散训练，支持少步采样，提高生成质量，保留底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为通用任务、高质量视觉表示提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Motivation: EEG和ECoG信号在运动想象分类中有应用潜力，但易受生理伪影影响，Transformer方法难捕捉细粒度依赖。

Method: 提出Cortical - SSM架构，将深度状态空间模型扩展以捕捉EEG和ECoG信号在时间、空间和频率域的综合依赖。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，方法优于基线方法，模型的视觉解释表明能有效捕捉信号的神经生理相关区域。

Conclusion: Cortical - SSM架构在EEG和ECoG信号分类中具有优势，能有效应对现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future

TL;DR: 介绍LoSP - Prompt重建框架用于解决多 shot DWI临床应用问题，经大量临床图像验证效果良好，有变革潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多 shot DWI用于全身肿瘤诊断受运动诱导相位伪影及多方面复杂性限制，需解决这些问题。

Method: 引入LoSP - Prompt框架，将 shot 间相位变化建模为高阶局部平滑相位并集成到低秩 Hankel 矩阵重建，通过仅在模拟生理运动的合成腹部 DWI 数据上训练的提示学习自动设置算法的秩参数。

Result: 在 10000 + 临床图像验证中，空间分辨率达临床单 shot DWI 两倍，可增强肝脏病变清晰度；单一模型可应用于七个不同解剖区域；在图像质量、伪影抑制和降噪方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需导航信号和真实数据监督，为高分辨率多器官多 shot DWI 提供可解释、稳健的解决方案，对精准肿瘤学有变革潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型易受越狱攻击，现有检测方法泛化性、准确性和效率不足。

Method: 提出 LoD 框架，包括多模态安全概念激活向量模块和安全模式自动编码器模块，从攻击特定学习转向任务特定学习。

Result: 在多种未知攻击上检测 AUROC 更高，且提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD 框架能有效准确检测未知越狱攻击，具有良好性能和效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出证据优先自适应框架EARL解决长视频推理难题，实验显示其在多基准测试达开源视频大模型新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态均匀帧采样导致信息稀释、现有像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格奖励机制和时间信息补充能力，影响长视频推理效果。

Method: 提出证据优先自适应框架，核心是证据感知强化学习（EARL）框架，动态选择相关帧并对关键帧局部重采样。

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中，EARL训练的模型达到开源视频大模型新SOTA，7B模型在多个基准测试取得高准确率。

Conclusion: 强调优先考虑证据纯度的重要性和所提框架的有效性。

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

Result: 在图表推理实验中大幅提升对未见问题的性能，不同种子数据的因子级混合训练能更好跨数据集迁移。

Conclusion: COGS框架能赋予MLLMs高级推理能力，具有可泛化性，且可拓展到其他领域。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

Result: 尽管训练集小，但微调后模型性能显著提升，数据集适用于少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: ClapperText数据集为低资源档案环境下的OCR和文档理解提供了现实且有文化背景的资源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Conclusion: 双曲几何是不完全监督下结构化分类更可靠的范式。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

Method: 在高表现离线框架基础上，通过潜在空间流式架构、滑动窗口因果设计以及注入解码动作特征扩展为在线设置。

Result: 实验表明在基准数据集上可实现长序列实时任意风格化，平衡风格化质量与响应性。

Conclusion: LILAC能在不依赖未来帧或修改扩散模型架构的情况下，实现长序列实时任意动作风格化。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

*Huan Chen,Ting Han,Siyu Chen,Zhihao Guo,Yiping Chen,Meiliu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic4Safety框架分析街景图像与交通事故，发现不同事故类型因果模式，为道路安全规划提供工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决构建街道层面事故特征指标及量化不同事故类型因果影响的挑战。

Method: 应用零样本语义分割从街景图像导出指标，结合道路类型信息；训练XGBoost多分类器，用SHAP解释特征贡献，用GPS加权和ATE估计控制混淆和量化因果效应。

Result: 发现不同事故类型的因果模式，场景复杂度、暴露度和道路几何特征预测能力强，可行驶区域和应急空间降低风险，视觉开放性过高增加风险。

Conclusion: Semantic4Safety连接预测建模和因果推断，支持针对性干预和高风险路段诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供可扩展、数据驱动工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

TL;DR: 提出NDM框架检测和缓解文本到图像生成中的隐式恶意意图，保持模型生成能力，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型易因隐式性提示生成不当内容，现有检测方法难以处理隐式线索，微调方法会降低生成质量。

Method: 提出NDM框架，利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发检测方法，提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗性数据集上验证NDM，表现优于SLD、UCE和RECE等现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: NDM能有效检测和缓解隐式恶意意图，同时保持模型原始生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and

Motivation: 在获取精细标注困难或昂贵时，粗标注分割困难，尤其是优化类别边界对齐时。

Method: 提出一种正则化方法，鼓励解码图像中的分割像素为基于像素颜色和位置的SLIC超像素，应用于FCN - 16架构。

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，在粗标注训练时边界召回率比现有模型显著提高。

Conclusion: 该正则化方法在粗标注的语义分割任务中有效，能提升边界召回率。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

TL;DR: 提出无属性标签算法LFA识别亚群体，在多个模型和基准测试中表现优于传统方法，可用于人脸识别模型表示审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型存在系统偏差，传统偏差评估框架依赖有标签属性，获取成本高且类别有限。

Method: 引入无属性标签算法Latent Feature Alignment (LFA)，利用潜在方向识别亚群体。

Result: 在四个先进识别模型和两个基准测试中，LFA在组内语义一致性上始终优于k - means和最近邻搜索，且能发现与人口和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA是一种实用的人脸识别模型表示审计方法，无需预定义属性注释即可识别和解释有偏差的亚群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

Motivation: 为推动机器智能发展，使机器具备跨多模态感知能力，如同人类感知世界。

Method: 研究模型架构和数据管理设计选择，架构上有OmniAlignNet、Temporal Embedding Grouping、Constrained Rotary Time Embedding三项创新，数据上引入生成2400万单模态和全模态对话的流程。

Result: OmniVinci在DailyOmni、MMAR、Video - MME等指标上表现优于Qwen2.5 - Omni，训练令牌仅为其六分之一。

Conclusion: 模态在感知和推理中相互强化，OmniVinci在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中有全模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善潜在扩散模型高频保真度并抑制罕见激活峰值。

Method: 结合每样本微钳位和自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip），AQClip有代理和注意力熵引导两种模式。

Result: 集成到CADE 2.5渲染管线，低步数和超高分辨率下效果更清晰、锐利，开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: QSilk在不同骨干网络有一致改进，与CFG/Rescale协同可提高引导度且无伪影。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CBMs存在输入到概念映射偏差和可控性有限的问题，限制其实用价值。

Method: 提出LDCBM，自动将视觉特征分组，引入滤波器分组损失和联合概念监督。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上，LDCBM实现了更高的概念和类别准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了先前模型的基本局限，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Motivation: 心血管疾病和慢性肾病是糖尿病主要并发症，传统诊断标志物在早期缺乏敏感性，需改善早期诊断。

Method: 结合传统统计与机器学习方法，用SPSS计算描述性和推断性统计，确定疾病与临床或人口因素关联，划分患者为四组，采用逻辑回归、支持向量机和随机森林算法建模。

Result: 血清肌酐和高血压与CKD显著相关，胆固醇、甘油三酯、心肌梗死、中风和高血压与CVD显著相关，随机森林算法准确性最高，集成模型表现优于单一分类器。

Conclusion: 混合统计机器学习框架在糖尿病并发症早期检测和风险分层方面比传统诊断方法更有前景，但存在可解释性和类别不平衡挑战。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease are major complications of
diabetes, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Early detection of these
conditions is critical, yet traditional diagnostic markers often lack
sensitivity in the initial stages. This study integrates conventional
statistical methods with machine learning approaches to improve early diagnosis
of CKD and CVD in diabetic patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics
were computed in SPSS to explore associations between diseases and clinical or
demographic factors. Patients were categorized into four groups: Group A both
CKD and CVD, Group B CKD only, Group C CVD only, and Group D no disease.
Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations: Serum Creatinine and
Hypertension with CKD, and Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Myocardial Infarction,
Stroke, and Hypertension with CVD. These results guided the selection of
predictive features for machine learning models. Logistic Regression, Support
Vector Machine, and Random Forest algorithms were implemented, with Random
Forest showing the highest accuracy, particularly for CKD prediction. Ensemble
models outperformed single classifiers in identifying high-risk diabetic
patients. SPSS results further validated the significance of the key parameters
integrated into the models. While challenges such as interpretability and class
imbalance remain, this hybrid statistical machine learning framework offers a
promising advancement toward early detection and risk stratification of
diabetic complications compared to conventional diagnostic approaches.

Result: 模型重现标志性行为发现，捕捉动态交互，阐明容量约束、语义处理和情景重放的影响。

Conclusion: GENESIS提供统一理论框架，增进对人类认知生成基础的理解。

Abstract: A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to explain how semantic and
episodic memory, two major forms of declarative memory, typically associated
with cortical and hippocampal processing, interact to support learning, recall,
and imagination. Despite significant advances, we still lack a unified
computational framework that jointly accounts for core empirical phenomena
across both semantic and episodic processing domains. Here, we introduce the
Generative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational
model that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity
generative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and
generalization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and
retrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS
reproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic
memory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in
episodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their
dynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the
fidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces
systematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can
recombine previous experiences. Together, these results provide a principled
account of memory as an active, constructive, and resource-bounded process.
GENESIS thus advances a unified theoretical framework that bridges semantic and
episodic memory, offering new insights into the generative foundations of human
cognition.

Result: 证明了任意策略可转换为对应SPRT的最优“差异策略”。

Conclusion: 给出判定加权硬币偏差问题中SPRT最优性的离散自包含证明。

Abstract: This paper revisits the classical problem of determining the bias of a
weighted coin, where the bias is known to be either $p = 1/2 + \varepsilon$ or
$p = 1/2 - \varepsilon$, while minimizing the expected number of coin tosses
and the error probability. The optimal strategy for this problem is given by
Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), which compares the
log-likelihood ratio against fixed thresholds to determine a stopping time.
Classical proofs of this result typically rely on analytical, continuous, and
non-constructive arguments. In this paper, we present a discrete,
self-contained proof of the optimality of the SPRT for this problem. We model
the problem as a biased random walk on the two-dimensional (heads, tails)
integer lattice, and model strategies as marked stopping times on this lattice.
Our proof takes a straightforward greedy approach, showing how any arbitrary
strategy may be transformed into the optimal, parallel-line "difference policy"
corresponding to the SPRT, via a sequence of local perturbations that improve a
Bayes risk objective.

Conclusion: 所提模型在超出标准Landau模型的中等耦合区域有效。

Abstract: We present a generalized, data-driven collisional operator for one-component
plasmas, learned from molecular dynamics simulations, to extend the collisional
kinetic model beyond the weakly coupled regime. The proposed operator features
an anisotropic, non-stationary collision kernel that accounts for particle
correlations typically neglected in classical Landau formulations. To enable
efficient numerical evaluation, we develop a fast spectral separation method
that represents the kernel as a low-rank tensor product of univariate basis
functions. This formulation admits an $O(N \log N)$ algorithm via fast Fourier
transforms and preserves key physical properties, including discrete
conservation laws and the H-theorem, through a structure-preserving central
difference discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model accurately captures plasma dynamics in the moderately coupled regime
beyond the standard Landau model while maintaining high computational
efficiency and structure-preserving properties.

TL;DR: FHE - SQL 是基于全同态加密的隐私保护数据库系统，能在加密数据上安全查询，与其他系统对比有优势并采用特定优化架构和技术保证安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于属性保留加密系统易受攻击，基于可信硬件方法有信任和侧信道限制，高性能 FHE 引擎适用场景有限，需设计新系统解决这些问题。

Method: 利用全同态加密，采用间接架构分离元数据和大密文，支持通过同态布尔掩码进行遗忘选择、多层缓存和垃圾回收，在通用可组合框架下证明安全性。

Result: 实现了能在加密数据上进行安全查询处理的 FHE - SQL 系统。

Conclusion: FHE - SQL 可在不依赖可信执行环境下为关系数据管理提供端到端加密保护，解决了现有系统的一些问题。

Abstract: FHE-SQL is a privacy-preserving database system that enables secure query
processing on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
providing privacy guaranties where an untrusted server can execute encrypted
queries without learning either the query contents or the underlying data.
Unlike property-preserving encryption-based systems such as CryptDB, which rely
on deterministic or order-preserving encryption and are vulnerable to
frequency, order, and equality-pattern inference attacks, FHE-SQL performs
computations entirely under encryption, eliminating these leakage channels.
Compared to trusted-hardware approaches such as TrustedDB, which depend on a
hardware security module and thus inherit its trust and side-channel
limitations, our design achieves end-to-end cryptographic protection without
requiring trusted execution environments. In contrast to high-performance
FHE-based engines-Hermes, which target specialized workloads such as vector
search, FHE-SQL supports general SQL query semantics with schema-aware,
type-safe definitions suitable for relational data management. FHE-SQL
mitigates the high cost of ciphertext space by using an indirection
architecture that separates metadata in RocksDB from large ciphertexts in blob
storage. It supports oblivious selection via homomorphic boolean masks,
multi-tier caching, and garbage collection, with security proven under the
Universal Composability framework.

Motivation: 恶意软件攻击经济影响大，商业检测软件成本高且缺乏将恶意软件与漏洞关联的工具，需理解恶意软件与目标漏洞的联系。

Method: 利用大语言模型检测JAR文件中的二进制恶意软件，结合检索增强生成识别CVE，开发工具MalCVE，集成多种功能。

Result: 使用3839个JAR可执行文件的基准数据集评估，MalCVE恶意软件检测平均准确率达97%，成本远低于商业解决方案，首个关联CVE与二进制恶意软件，召回率达65%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，MalCVE在恶意软件检测和CVE关联方面表现良好，成本优势明显。

Abstract: Malicious software attacks are having an increasingly significant economic
impact. Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that
attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are
largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the
vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and
proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an
approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware,
specifically within JAR files, and utilizes the capabilities of LLMs combined
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept
tool called MalCVE, which integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation,
LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and CVE
classification using LLMs. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of
3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware detection accuracy of
97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. It is also the first
tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which
is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.

Abstract: With the growth of digital financial systems, robust security and privacy
have become a concern for financial institutions. Even though traditional
machine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they
often compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive
information. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems
that regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated
Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration
among banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This
survey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a
novel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance
exposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio
optimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike
prior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems,
discussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention
and blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not
without challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory
compliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current
defense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain
integration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and
quantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for
researchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant
financial systems.

TL;DR: 提出基于蜜罐的主动护栏系统应对大语言模型多轮越狱攻击，实验显示能显著破坏攻击成功率并保留良性用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型易受多轮越狱攻击，现有防御依赖被动拒绝，存在应对自适应攻击者失败或过度限制良性用户的问题。

Method: 微调诱饵模型生成模糊、无实际行动但语义相关的回复作为诱饵探测用户意图，结合受保护大语言模型的安全回复插入主动诱饵问题，引入蜜罐效用分数和防御效率率。

Result: 在MHJ数据集上用近期攻击方法对GPT - 4o进行的初步实验表明，系统显著破坏了越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 该系统能在保留良性用户体验的同时有效应对多轮越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to multi-turn
jailbreak attacks, where adversaries iteratively elicit harmful behaviors that
bypass single-turn safety filters. Existing defenses predominantly rely on
passive rejection, which either fails against adaptive attackers or overly
restricts benign users. We propose a honeypot-based proactive guardrail system
that transforms risk avoidance into risk utilization. Our framework fine-tunes
a bait model to generate ambiguous, non-actionable but semantically relevant
responses, which serve as lures to probe user intent. Combined with the
protected LLM's safe reply, the system inserts proactive bait questions that
gradually expose malicious intent through multi-turn interactions. We further
introduce the Honeypot Utility Score (HUS), measuring both the attractiveness
and feasibility of bait responses, and use a Defense Efficacy Rate (DER) for
balancing safety and usability. Initial experiment on MHJ Datasets with recent
attack method across GPT-4o show that our system significantly disrupts
jailbreak success while preserving benign user experience.

Motivation: MLLMs虽能力强但易受跨模态越狱攻击，需新方法利用其跨模态漏洞。

Method: 用辅助LLM将恶意查询分解为无害故事元素，通过扩散模型生成图像序列，利用模型对叙事连贯性的依赖引出有害输出。

Result: 在有害文本查询实验中平均攻击成功率达83.5%，超现有方法46%，在不同有害内容类别中表现更优。

Conclusion: 分析攻击模式，揭示多模态安全机制关键脆弱因素，指出当前防御策略对叙事驱动攻击存在显著漏洞。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but
remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks exploiting cross-modal vulnerabilities.
In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style
visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs.
Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling
elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences
through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative
coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual
queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an
average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by
46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative
strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of
harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability
factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of
current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing
significant gaps in existing protections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模网络数据集推动预训练语言模型发展，但数据使用存在版权问题，现有数据集所有权验证方法在自然噪声和对抗性扰动下假设不成立。

Method: 引入双空间平滑的方法，在嵌入空间引入连续扰动，在排列空间进行受控令牌重排序；分两阶段，第一阶段在双空间嵌入触发器生成水印数据集，第二阶段验证时在双空间应用随机平滑计算水印鲁棒性并与良性模型比较。

Result: 在多个代表性网络数据集上的大量实验表明，DSSmoothing实现了稳定可靠的验证性能，对潜在的自适应攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DSSmoothing为数据集所有权验证提供了可证明的鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained
language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious
copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods
typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this
assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations.
We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs
based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of
text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous
perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies
controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential
robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers
are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and
robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is
applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness
(WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal
probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing
provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by
ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space
perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets
demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification
performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

Motivation: 大语言模型广泛部署带来安全风险，但攻击和防御技术研究碎片化，定义、威胁模型和评估标准差异大，阻碍了系统进展和公平比较。

Method: 提出多层面分类法、将威胁模型和成本假设形式化为机器可读配置文件、引入开源评估工具包、发布JAILBREAKDB数据集、对现有方法进行综合评估并给出排行榜。

Conclusion: 支持开发适用于高风险部署的健壮、可信的大语言模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to real-world
applications, powering services across diverse sectors. However, their
widespread deployment has exposed critical security risks, particularly through
jailbreak prompts that can bypass model alignment and induce harmful outputs.
Despite intense research into both attack and defense techniques, the field
remains fragmented: definitions, threat models, and evaluation criteria vary
widely, impeding systematic progress and fair comparison. In this
Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we address these challenges by (1)
proposing a holistic, multi-level taxonomy that organizes attacks, defenses,
and vulnerabilities in LLM prompt security; (2) formalizing threat models and
cost assumptions into machine-readable profiles for reproducible evaluation;
(3) introducing an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized, auditable
comparison of attacks and defenses; (4) releasing JAILBREAKDB, the largest
annotated dataset of jailbreak and benign prompts to date; and (5) presenting a
comprehensive evaluation and leaderboard of state-of-the-art methods. Our work
unifies fragmented research, provides rigorous foundations for future studies,
and supports the development of robust, trustworthy LLMs suitable for
high-stakes deployment.

TL;DR: 为解决大语言模型训练过程中后门攻击检测问题，提出Proof-of-Training Steps验证协议，可早期检测攻击，提高训练安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在关键领域应用广泛，现有后训练验证方案对大语言模型不实用，缺乏早期检测能力，需降低计算成本，确保训练过程安全可信。

Method: 引入Proof-of-Training Steps验证协议，分析大语言模型语言建模头对输入扰动的敏感性，以暴露训练中的后门注入或偏差。

Result: 即使10%的训练数据存在后门触发器，该协议也能显著降低攻击者的攻击成功率，验证步骤比训练步骤快3倍。

Conclusion: 该协议有潜力增强大语言模型开发的问责性和安全性，尤其针对内部威胁。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across critical domains,
ensuring secure and trustworthy training processes has become a major concern.
Backdoor attacks, where malicious actors inject hidden triggers into training
data, are particularly insidious and difficult to detect. Existing
post-training verification solutions like Proof-of-Learning are impractical for
LLMs due to their requirement for full retraining, lack of robustness against
stealthy manipulations, and inability to provide early detection during
training. Early detection would significantly reduce computational costs. To
address these limitations, we introduce Proof-of-Training Steps, a verification
protocol that enables an independent auditor (Alice) to confirm that an LLM
developer (Bob) has followed the declared training recipe, including data
batches, architecture, and hyperparameters. By analyzing the sensitivity of the
LLMs' language modeling head (LM-Head) to input perturbations, our method can
expose subtle backdoor injections or deviations in training. Even with backdoor
triggers in up to 10 percent of the training data, our protocol significantly
reduces the attacker's ability to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). Our
method enables early detection of attacks at the injection step, with
verification steps being 3x faster than training steps. Our results highlight
the protocol's potential to enhance the accountability and security of LLM
development, especially against insider threats.

TL;DR: 文章引入OCR - APT系统用于APT检测和重构攻击故事，评估显示其在检测准确性和警报可解释性上优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APT检测系统依赖节点属性，导致误报率高、警报粒度粗，缺乏能生成准确攻击叙事的系统。

Method: OCR - APT使用GNN进行子图异常检测，学习节点周围行为模式；用LLM迭代检测子图重构多阶段攻击故事，且验证各阶段。

Result: 在DARPA TC3、OpTC和NODLINK数据集上，OCR - APT在检测准确性和警报可解释性上优于现有系统，能重构全面的攻击故事。

Conclusion: OCR - APT是一种有效的APT检测和攻击故事重构系统，具有更好的检测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade
detection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as
connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by
linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these
graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained
alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to
spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully
understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems
that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To
address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and
reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes
rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads
to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs
using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories.
Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring
an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and
NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both
detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs
human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.

Conclusion: ARHNN方法及其简化变体在电价预测中有良好表现，预测驱动策略有实际商业应用价值。

Abstract: Calibration sample selection and forecast combination are two simple yet
powerful tools used in forecasting. They can be combined with a variety of
models to significantly improve prediction accuracy, at the same time offering
easy implementation and low computational complexity. While their effectiveness
has been repeatedly confirmed in prior scientific literature, the topic is
still underexplored in the field of electricity price forecasting. In this
research article we apply the Autoregressive Hybrid Nearest Neighbors (ARHNN)
method to three long-term time series describing the German, Spanish and New
England electricity markets. We show that it outperforms popular literature
benchmarks in terms of forecast accuracy by up to 10%. We also propose two
simplified variants of the method, granting a vast decrease in computation time
with only minor loss of prediction accuracy. Finally, we compare the forecasts'
performance in a battery storage system trading case study. We find that using
a forecast-driven strategy can achieve up to 80% of theoretical maximum profits
while trading, demonstrating business value in practical applications.

Result: 在覆盖美国多个系统的大规模数据集上的数值实验表明，该框架提高了站点和舰队层面概率预测的质量。

Conclusion: 与现有基线相比，该方法在可再生能源应用中实现了更高的预测可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is critical for reliable power grid operations,
particularly as the share of renewable generation, such as wind and solar,
continues to grow. Given the inherent uncertainty and variability in renewable
generation, probabilistic forecasts have become essential for informed
operational decisions. However, such forecasts frequently suffer from
calibration issues, potentially degrading decision-making performance. Building
on recent advances in Conformal Predictions, this paper introduces a tailored
calibration framework that constructs context-aware calibration sets using a
novel weighting scheme. The proposed framework improves the quality of
probabilistic forecasts at the site and fleet levels, as demonstrated by
numerical experiments on large-scale datasets covering several systems in the
United States. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
higher forecast reliability and robustness for renewable energy applications
compared to existing baselines.
