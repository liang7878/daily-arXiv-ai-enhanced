Recent advances in additive manufacturing facilitate the physical realization of multi-material excipients, offering superior customization of target release profiles. However, polypill formulations remain tuned by ad hoc parameter sweeps; this reliance renders current design workflows ill-suited for the systematic exploration of the high-dimensional space of shapes, compositions, and release behaviors.\n  We present an automated design framework for polypills that leverages topology optimization to match dissolution behaviors with prescribed drug release kinetics. In particular, we employ a supershape parametrization to define geometry/phase distribution, a neural network representation to specify excipient distribution, and a coupled system of modified Allen-Cahn and Fick's diffusion equations to govern dissolution kinetics. The framework is implemented in JAX, utilizing automatic differentiation to compute sensitivities for the co-optimization of pill shape and constituent distribution.

High-fidelity datasets remain costly, confidential, and slow to obtain, while edge devices face strict limits on latency, bandwidth, and energy. These factors restrict the practicality of centralized deep learning, hinder the development of reliable digital twins, and increase the risk of error escape in safety-critical applications. Motivated by these challenges, this dissertation develops an efficiency grounded computational framework that enables data lean, physics-aware, and deployment ready intelligence for modern manufacturing environments. The research advances methods that collectively address core bottlenecks across multimodal and multiscale industrial scenarios. Generative strategies mitigate data scarcity and imbalance, while semi-supervised learning integrates unlabeled information to reduce annotation and simulation demands. Physics-informed representation learning strengthens interpretability and improves condition monitoring under small-data regimes. Spatially aware graph-based surrogate modeling provides efficient approximation of complex processes, and an edge cloud collaborative compression scheme supports real-time signal analytics under resource constraints. The dissertation also extends visual understanding through zero-shot vision language reasoning augmented by domain specific retrieval, enabling generalizable assessment in previously unseen scenarios.

However, existing financial benchmarks primarily focus on textbook-style question answering and numerical problem solving, but fail to evaluate models' real-world safety behaviors. They weakly assess regulatory compliance and investor-protection norms, rarely stress-test multi-turn adversarial tactics such as jailbreaks or prompt injection, inconsistently ground answers in long filings, ignore tool- or RAG-induced over-reach risks, and rely on opaque or non-auditable evaluation protocols. To close these gaps, we introduce CNFinBench, a benchmark that employs finance-tailored red-team dialogues and is structured around a Capability-Compliance-Safety triad, including evidence-grounded reasoning over long reports and jurisdiction-aware rule/tax compliance tasks. For systematic safety quantification, we introduce the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS) to measure how consistently models resist harmful prompts across multi-turn adversarial dialogues. To ensure auditability, CNFinBench enforces strict output formats with dynamic option perturbation for objective tasks and employs a hybrid LLM-ensemble plus human-calibrated judge for open-ended evaluations. Experiments on 21 models across 15 subtasks confirm a persistent capability-compliance gap: models achieve an average score of 61.0 on capability tasks but fall to 34.18 on compliance and risk-control evaluations. Under multi-turn adversarial dialogue tests, most systems reach only partial resistance (HICS 60-79), demonstrating that refusal alone is not a reliable proxy for safety without cited and verifiable reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91d1\u878d\u57fa\u51c6CNFinBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91d1\u878d\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CNFinBench\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91d1\u878d\u5b9a\u5236\u7ea2\u961f\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b - \u5408\u89c4 - \u5b89\u5168\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165HICS\u91cf\u5316\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u5f3a\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u6df7\u5408LLM\u96c6\u6210\u52a0\u4eba\u5de5\u6821\u51c6\u8bc4\u5224\u3002", "result": "21\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u572815\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u574761.0\u5206\uff0c\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u98ce\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u81f334.18\u5206\uff1b\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u591a\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u5206\u62b5\u6297\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u529b - \u5408\u89c4\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ec5\u62d2\u7edd\u6709\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Recent work on data-driven methods has leveraged probabilistic models to achieve higher estimation accuracy, but these approaches cannot guarantee low inference latency at the same time and neglect scalability. As data dimensionality grows, optimization time can even exceed actual query execution time. Furthermore, inference with probabilistic models by sampling or integration procedures unpredictable estimation result and violate stability, which brings unstable performance with query execution and make database tuning hard for database users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to cardinality estimation based on cumulative distribution function(CDF), which calculates range query cardinality without sampling or integration, ensuring accurate and predictable estimation results. With inference acceleration by merging calculations, we can achieve fast and nearly constant inference speed while maintaining high accuracy, even as dimensionality increases, which is over 10x faster than current state-of-the-art data-driven cardinality estimator. This demonstrates its excellent dimensional scalability, making it well-suited for real-world database applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCDF\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5feb\u4e14\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u968f\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff08CDF\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u79ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u56f4\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5feb10\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Bl\u00f6baum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor.

Our algorithms are randomized, and have a running time of $O\\left(m^{1+o(1)}/\u03b5\\right)$ on any $m$-edge $n$-vertex input graph, assuming all edge/vertex weights are polynomially-bounded. In particular, for any constant $\u03b5>0$, our algorithms have an almost-optimal running time of $O\\left(m^{1+o(1)}\\right)$. The fastest previously-known running time for this setting, due to (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), is $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\min\\left\\{n^2/\u03b5^2,m^{1+o(1)}\\sqrt{n}\\right\\}\\right)$ for Minimum Edge-Cut, and $\\tilde{O}\\left(n^2/\u03b5^2\\right)$ for Minimum Vertex-Cut. Our results further extend to the rooted variants of the Minimum Edge-Cut and Minimum Vertex-Cut problems, where the algorithm is additionally given a root vertex $r$, and the goal is to find a minimum-weight cut separating any vertex from the root $r$. In terms of techniques, we build upon and extend a framework that was recently introduced by (Chuzhoy et al., SODA 2026) for solving the Minimum Vertex-Cut problem in unweighted directed graphs. Additionally, in order to obtain our result for the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem, we develop a novel black-box reduction from this problem to its rooted variant.

Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and Resource Exchange. We ask whether improved general reasoning capabilities lead to rational, unbiased, and convergent negotiation strategies. Our results challenge this assumption. We find that models diverge into distinct, model specific strategic equilibria rather than converging to a unified optimal behavior. Moreover, strong numerical and semantic anchoring effects persist: initial offers are highly predictive of final agreements, and models consistently generate biased proposals by collapsing diverse internal valuations into rigid, generic price points. More concerningly, we observe dominance patterns in which some models systematically achieve higher payoffs than their counterparts.

To address load imbalance across GPUs in EP, existing approaches aim to balance the number of tokens each GPU processes. Surprisingly, we find that this objective degrades performance rather than improving it when processing is memory-bound - a common occurrence in MoE serving, especially in the decode phase. Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime.\n  We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed.

However, despite the rich potential of tools like GLSL, the steep learning curve and requirement for programming fluency pose substantial barriers for newcomers and even experienced artists who may not have a technical background. In this paper, we present AI Co-Artist, a novel interactive system that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to support the iterative evolution and refinement of GLSL shaders through a user-friendly, visually-driven interface. Drawing inspiration from the user-guided evolutionary principles pioneered by the Picbreeder platform, our system empowers users to evolve shader art using intuitive interactions, without needing to write or understand code. AI Co-Artist serves as both a creative companion and a technical assistant, allowing users to explore a vast generative design space of real-time visual art. Through comprehensive evaluations, including structured user studies and qualitative feedback, we demonstrate that AI Co-Artist significantly reduces the technical threshold for shader creation, enhances creative outcomes, and supports a wide range of users in producing professional-quality visual effects.

The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.

The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\u7684ATM\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u73af\u5883\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742mHealth\u573a\u666f\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u6807\u51c6ATM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\u7684ATM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5f0f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u56de\u62a5\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u4f4e\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742mHealth\u573a\u666f\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u3002"}}

Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of H\u00e1jek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u7ebf\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSSQP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u826f\u597d\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u7c7b\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08SSQP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u52a8\u91cf\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u672f\u53bb\u504f\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6e10\u8fd1\u6b63\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u539f - \u5bf9\u5076\u6781\u9650\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d2\u4ef6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "SSQP\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6295\u5f71\u7b97\u5b50\u8fbe\u539f - \u5bf9\u5076\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5168\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

As RAG expands with table-augmented generation to incorporate structured data, workloads integrating table and vector search are becoming more prevalent. However, efficiently executing such queries remains challenging due to inaccurate cardinality estimation for vector search components, leading to suboptimal query plans. In this paper, we propose Exqutor, an extended query optimizer for vector-augmented analytical queries. Exqutor is a pluggable cardinality estimation framework designed to address this issue, leveraging exact cardinality query optimization techniques to enhance estimation accuracy when vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF) are available.

Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations.

A key advantage is the algorithm's ability to process many updates simultaneously, which makes it naturally adaptable to the parallel and distributed models. Concretely, it gives a unified framework across the models, leading to the following results:\n  - In the sequential setting, the algorithm processes each update in $O(1)$ expected time, worst-case. This matches and strengthens the results of Henzinger and Peng [TALG 2022] and Bhattacharya et al. [TALG 2022], who achieved an $O(1)$ bound but amortized (in expectation and with high probability, respectively), whose work was an improvement of the $O(\\log \u0394)$ expected amortized bound of Bhattacharya et al. [SODA'18].\n  - In the parallel setting, the algorithm processes each (arbitrary size) batch of updates using $O(1)$ work per update in the batch in expectation, and in $\\text{poly}(\\log n)$ depth with high probability. This is, in a sense, an ideal parallelization of the above results.\n  - In the distributed setting, the algorithm can maintain a coloring of the network graph as (potentially many) edges are added or deleted. The maintained coloring is always proper; it may become partial upon updates, i.e., some nodes may temporarily lose their colors, but quickly converges to a full, proper coloring. Concretely, each insertion and deletion causes at most $O(1)$ nodes to become uncolored, but this is resolved within $O(\\log n)$ rounds with high probability (e.g., in the absence of further updates nearby--the precise guarantee is stronger, but technical).

Each owner has a private cost for providing access to their facility (e.g., renting it or selling it to the company) and needs to be compensated accordingly. The goal is to design truthful auctions that decide which facilities the company should procure and how much to pay the corresponding owners, aiming to minimize the total cost, i.e., the monetary cost paid to the owners and the connection cost suffered by the customers (their distance to the nearest facility). We evaluate the performance of these auctions using the \\emph{frugality ratio}.\n  We first analyze the performance of the classic VCG auction in this context and prove that its frugality ratio is exactly $3$. We then leverage the learning-augmented framework and design auctions that are augmented with predictions regarding the owners' private costs. Specifically, we propose a family of learning-augmented auctions that achieve significant payment reductions when the predictions are accurate, leading to much better frugality ratios. At the same time, we demonstrate that these auctions remain robust even if the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate, and maintain reasonable frugality ratios even under adversarially chosen predictions.

However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure.

With rising climate stress, unpredictable feed prices, and persistent disease threats, poultry producers often struggle to make quick, informed decisions. Therefore, there is a critical need for intelligent, data-driven systems that can deliver reliable, on-demand consultation. This paper presents PoultryTalk, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide real-time expert guidance through text and image-based interaction. PoultryTalk uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and GPT-4o to provide smart, context-aware poultry management advice from text, images, or questions. System usability and performance were evaluated using 200 expert-verified queries and feedback from 34 participants who submitted 267 queries to the PoultryTalk prototype. The expert-verified benchmark queries confirmed strong technical performance, achieving a semantic similarity of 84.0% and an average response latency of 3.6 seconds.

Neural operators, in contrast, have emerged as powerful tools in scientific machine learning for learning such mappings. However, standard neural operators typically lack mechanisms for mixing or attending to input information across space and time. In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In particular, BNO achieves robust zero-shot super-resolution in unsteady flow prediction and consistently outperforms conventional Koopman-based methods and deep learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBanach\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08BNO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7b97\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u7a7a\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u6df7\u5408\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8c31\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3cBanach\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728Navier - Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cBNO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5b9a\u5e38\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "BNO\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split. Contributions: (1) an agent-centred simulator that turns interviews into 276 interactive patients with bounded nonverbal counterfactuals; (2) a safe learning loop that treats timing and rapport as first-class control variables; (3) a comparative study (TD3 vs PPO/CEM) with clear gains in completeness and social timing; and (4) ablations and robustness analyses explaining the gains and enabling clinician-supervised humanoid pilots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u786c\u4ef6\u8d1f\u62c5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0cTD3\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u9879\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b58\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u6613\u78e8\u635f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u91cd\u653e\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6e\u6b21\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49TD3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u4e8ePPO\u548cCEM\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bd5\u70b9\u3002"}}

When only proxy indicators and censored observations are available, it becomes necessary to express the distribution's parameters as functions of time-dependent covariates. Deep neural networks provide the flexibility needed to learn complex relationships between these covariates and operational lifetime, thereby extending the capabilities of traditional regression-based models. Motivated by the analysis of a fleet of military vehicles operating in highly variable and demanding environments, as well as by the limitations observed in existing methodologies, this paper introduces WTNN, a new neural network-based modeling framework specifically designed for Weibull survival studies. The proposed architecture is specifically designed to incorporate qualitative prior knowledge regarding the most influential covariates, in a manner consistent with the shape and structure of the Weibull distribution.

This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family.

It is built upon Operational Differencing, a new technique for managing data in terms of high-level operations that include refactorings and schema changes. We use operational differencing to construct an operation-based form of version control on data structures used in programming languages and relational databases. This approach to data version control does fine-grained diffing and merging despite intervening structural transformations like schema changes. It offers users a simplified conceptual model of version control for ad hoc usage: There is no repo; Branching is just copying. The informaton maintained in a repo can be synthesized more precisely from the append-only histories of branches. Branches can be flexibly shared as is commonly done with document files, except with the added benefit of diffing and merging. We conjecture that queries can be operationalized into a sequence of schema and data operations. We develop that idea on a query language fragment containing selects and joins. Operationalized queries are represented as a future timeline that is speculatively executed as a branch off of the present state, returning a value from its hypothetical future.

Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $\u0398(1/\\varepsilon)$, matching the known $\u03a9(1/\\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbf\u95ee\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6052\u5b9a\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5fcd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u672a\u77e5k - \u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cfH\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cfH0\u65f6\uff0c\u5224\u65adH\u4e0eH0\u662f\u5426\u76f8\u7b49\u6216\u5dee\u5f02\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a\u03b5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5411\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822cn - \u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3001k - \u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u65e0\u8ff9\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u603b\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO(c^k/\u03b5)\uff0c\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6210\u529f\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8eO(1) - \u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u603b\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u0398(1/\u03b5)\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230Heisenberg\u6781\u9650\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u9006\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6052\u5b9a\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5fcd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We present BatANN, a distributed disk-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) system that retains the logarithmic search efficiency of a single global graph while achieving near-linear throughput scaling in the number of servers. Our core innovation is that when accessing a neighborhood which is stored on another machine, we send the full state of the query to the other machine to continue executing there for improved locality. On 100M- and 1B-point datasets at 0.95 recall using 10 servers, BatANN achieves 6.21-6.49x and 2.5-5.10x the throughput of the scatter-gather baseline, respectively, while maintaining mean latency below 6 ms.

We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample.

In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints.

Bi-fidelity methods mitigate this challenge by leveraging a cheaper, approximate model to accelerate convergence. Most existing bi-fidelity approaches, however, exploit either design-space curvature or random-space correlation, not both. We present BISTRO - a BI-fidelity Stochastic Trust-Region Optimizer for unconstrained optimization under uncertainty through a stochastic approximation procedure. This approach exploits the curvature information of a low-fidelity objective function to converge within a basin of a local minimum of the high-fidelity model where low-fidelity curvature information is no longer valuable.

Weighted DRE is the most promising among existing methods, exhibiting doubly strong robustness from an asymptotic perspective. This study demonstrates that Weighted DRE achieves sparse consistency even under heavy contamination within a non-asymptotic framework. This method addresses two significant challenges in density ratio estimation and robust estimation. For density ratio estimation, we provide the non-asymptotic properties of estimating unbounded density ratios under the assumption that the weighted density ratio function is bounded. For robust estimation, we introduce a non-asymptotic framework for doubly strong robustness under heavy contamination, assuming that at least one of the following conditions holds: (i) contamination ratios are small, and (ii) outliers have small weighted values.

This work describes the implementation when using cofactors for in-database factorized learning. We benchmark our open-source implementation for learning linear regression on factorized joins with PostgreSQL -- as a disk-based database system -- and HyPer -- as an in-memory engine. The evaluation shows a performance gain of factorized learning on in-memory database systems by 70\\% to non-factorized learning and by a factor of 100 compared to disk-based database systems.

For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$.

Yet, their focus on algorithm evolution alone, neglecting the prompts that guide them, limits their effectiveness with LLMs, especially in complex, uncertain environments where they nonetheless implicitly rely on strategies from swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. Recognizing this, we argue that swarm intelligence optimization provides a more generalized and principled foundation for automated design. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative evolution of both swarm intelligence algorithms and guiding prompts using a single LLM. To enhance interpretability, we also propose a simple yet efficient evaluation method for prompt templates. The framework was rigorously evaluated on a range of NP problems, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art automated design approaches. Experiments with various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-32B, GPT-5) reveal significantly divergent evolutionary trajectories in the generated prompts, further underscoring the necessity of a structured co-evolution framework. Importantly, our approach maintains leading performance across different models, demonstrating reduced reliance on the most powerful LLMs and enabling more cost-effective deployments.

In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively.

Despite these advantages, the coexistence of near-field and far-field effects in hybrid-field channels presents significant challenges for accurate estimation, where traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.\n  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input. By fine-tuning only the top two Transformer layers, our method effectively captures latent dependencies in the pilot data while ensuring high training efficiency.

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations.

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.\n  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs.

While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \\model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \\model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \\model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.\n  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.\n  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.\n  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.\n  Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning.

However, existing statistical theory for OT map estimation is quite restricted, hinging on Brenier's theorem (quadratic cost, absolutely continuous source) to guarantee existence and uniqueness of a deterministic OT map, on which various additional regularity assumptions are imposed to obtain quantitative error bounds. In many real-world problems these conditions fail or cannot be certified, in which case optimal transportation is possible only via stochastic maps that can split mass. To broaden the scope of map estimation theory to such settings, this work introduces a novel metric for evaluating the transportation quality of stochastic maps. Under this metric, we develop computationally efficient map estimators with near-optimal finite-sample risk bounds, subject to easy-to-verify minimal assumptions. Our analysis further accommodates common forms of adversarial sample contamination, yielding estimators with robust estimation guarantees. Empirical experiments are provided which validate our theory and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in settings where existing theory fails. These contributions constitute the first general-purpose theory for map estimation, compatible with a wide spectrum of real-world applications where optimal transport may be intrinsically stochastic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u968f\u673a\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5e38\u89c1\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u5176\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u62d3\u5c55\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u968f\u673a\u6620\u5c04\u8fd0\u8f93\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u98ce\u9669\u754c\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u53ef\u80fd\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u968f\u673a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings.

These chains virtualise network functions, link them, and programmatically embed them on networking infrastructure. Optimal embedding of Service Function Chains is an NP-hard problem, with three sub-problems, chain composition, virtual network function embedding, and link embedding, that have to be optimised simultaneously, rather than sequentially, for optimal results. Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios.

LUMOS introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism that conditions predictions on future known events (e.g., holidays, sales, etc.), enabling the model to predict complex behaviour patterns like \"how will upcoming holidays affect user engagement?\" The architecture also employs multi-modal tokenization, combining user transactions, event context, and static user demographic attributes into rich representations processed through specialized embedding pathways.\n  Through extensive experiments on a production dataset spanning 275 billion user activity tokens from 250 million users, we demonstrate that LUMOS achieves superior performance compared to traditional task-specific models. Across 5 tasks with established baselines, we achieve an average improvement of 0.025 in ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks and 4.6\\% reduction in MAPE for regression tasks.

The study tracks intermediate projections of the self-attention layer during training and evaluates their evolution using discrete OT metrics, including Wasserstein distance, Monge gap, optimality, and efficiency. Experiments are conducted on classification tasks with two and three classes, as well as on a biomedical dataset.\n  Results indicate that the final self-attention mapping often approximates the OT optimal coupling, yet the training trajectory remains inefficient. Pretraining the MLP section on synthetic data partially improves convergence but is sensitive to their initialization. To address these limitations, an OT-based algorithm is introduced: it generates class-specific dummy Gaussian distributions, computes an OT alignment with the data, and trains an MLP to generalize this mapping.

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system.

We introduce a new family of methods that employ beam search to generate candidates for consistency-based UQ, yielding improved performance and reduced variance compared to multinomial sampling.

An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process.

To fill this gap, we conducted comprehensive experiments and found that stragglers remain widespread due to CPU and bandwidth usage imbalances. Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs. Moreover, it proactively prevents stragglers by avoiding overloading the CPU and bandwidth resources in allocating PSs (which consume high CPU and bandwidth) and in gradient transmission. Our trace-driven evaluation on AWS shows that STAR generates 48-84% and 51-70% lower TTA than state-of-the-art systems in the PS and all-reduce architectures, respectively, while maintaining the converged accuracy of SSGD.

We then show how to use attention weighting for time series and spatial data, and we present a method for adapting pretrained tree-based models to distributional shift using attention-weighted residual corrections. Across real and simulated datasets, attention weighting improves predictive performance while preserving interpretability, and theory shows that attention-weighting linear models attain lower mean squared error than the standard linear model under mixture-of-models data-generating processes with known subgroup structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u62df\u5408\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u70b9\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u503c\u6839\u636e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u52a0\u6743\u4ee5\u62df\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5c06\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u6743\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u6743\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4f7f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u6743\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5b50\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u6743\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Most existing structure-based attacks rely on gradient-based heuristics or local connectivity patterns, and treat edges as equally important candidates for manipulation. In this paper, we propose Spectral Edge Attacks (SEA), a new family of adversarial attacks that explicitly leverage spectral robustness evaluation to guide structural perturbations. Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space. Both attacks operate at the graph level, are model-aware but conceptually simple, and can be plugged into existing GNN architectures without requiring gradients.

Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings.

Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \\textbf{2.2$\\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \\textbf{99\\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \\textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \\textbf{12.8$\\times$} improvement in \\textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection. RIFT automatically generates UVM-compliant verification artifacts, ensuring its findings are directly actionable and integrable into commercial RTL verification workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRIFT\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u6545\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6709\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u786c\u4ef6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6545\u969c\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u6700\u5c0f\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b02.2\u500d\u6545\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8599%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6545\u969c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\uff1bRIFT\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u63d0\u534712.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "RIFT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u786c\u4ef6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4ef6\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5546\u4e1aRTL\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa CluCERT \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u8fb9\u754c\u5bbd\u677e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CluCERT \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u5e73\u6ed1\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u63d0\u53d6\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u9632\u5fa1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CluCERT \u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality.

Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.\n  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.\n  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems. We discuss limitations of this proof-of-concept study and outline directions for scaling the approach to larger models, datasets, and hardware platforms.

ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers.

Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented. Performance was evaluated on a 7-day holdout using MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. Results show that FBP consistently outperformed NP, SARIMAX, and the learning-based baselines, achieving test $R^2$ above 0.94 for both pollutants.

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSCOPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u73af\u5883\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u90e8\u7f72\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SCOPE\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u793a\u4f8b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728TextCraft\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe0.56\uff08ADaPT\u4e3a0.52\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece164.4\u79d2\u964d\u81f33.0\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8d77\u70b9\uff0cSCOPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002"}}

Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive.\n  We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields.\n  This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u8840\u7ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u62df\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5e8a\u8fb9\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u6162\u4e14\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c4D Flow MRI\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u9885\u5185\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5fc3\u52a8\u5468\u671f\u5168\u573a\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d41\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u7f51\u683c\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u6570\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e8a\u8fb9\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8303\u7574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7f51\u7edc\u8303\u7574\u95f4\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u8303\u7574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8303\u7574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\u5e76\u62c6\u5206\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u5f15\u5165\u51fd\u5b50\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose novel isotonic normalization-aware techniques for multiclass calibration, grounded in natural and intuitive assumptions expected by practitioners. Unlike prior approaches, our methods inherently account for probability normalization by either incorporating normalization directly into the optimization process (NA-FIR) or modeling the problem as a cumulative bivariate isotonic regression (SCIR).

Let $Q$ denote the distribution of $Y$. We introduce a hierarchy of denoisers $T_0, T_1, \\ldots, T_\\infty : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that are agnostic to the signal distribution $P$, depending only on higher-order score functions of $Q$. Each denoiser $T_K$ is progressively refined using the $(2K-1)$-th order score function of $Q$ at noise resolution $\u03c3^{2K}$, achieving better denoising quality measured by the Wasserstein metric $W(T_K \\sharp Q, P)$.

Particularly, we study the maneuver planning problem for autonomous vehicles and investigate how a decentralized reward structure can induce altruism in their behavior and incentivize them to account for the interest of other autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity of a human driver's willingness to cooperate with an autonomous vehicle.

This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup. These gains, particularly at longer lead times, are critical for emergency preparedness, where modest increases in forecast horizon can improve decision-making. This work advances DL-based precipitation forecasting by enhancing predictive skill, reliability, and applicability across regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u6b8b\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eHRRR\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6548\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6280\u5de7\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\u6c34\u6587\u6c14\u8c61\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u9700\u660e\u786e\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5bf9\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u5de7\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u4ec5\u8f93\u5165\u6e90\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u6548\u4ece1\u5c0f\u65f6\u523012\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eHRRR\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u77ed\u65f6\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cHRRR\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f83\u957f\u65f6\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4e1412\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6280\u5de7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u5de7\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u533a\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy. We compare our prediction-aware AV to state-of-the-art solutions and demonstrate performance improvements in terms of efficiency and safety in multiple simulated scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u793e\u4ea4\u6548\u7528\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f66\u8f86\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution.

Emerging conceptualisations of agentic AI and artificial agency suggest that such systems possess bounded autonomy, interactivity, and adaptability, allowing them to engage as epistemic participants rather than mere instructional tools. Building on this theoretical foundation, the present study investigates how agentic AI, designed as undercover teammates with either supportive or contrarian personas, shapes the epistemic and social dynamics of collaborative reasoning. Drawing on Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) four-dimensional framework, participation, epistemic reasoning, argument structure, and social modes of co-construction, we analysed synchronous discourse data from 212 human and 64 AI participants (92 triads) engaged in an analytical problem-solving task. Mixed-effects and epistemic network analyses revealed that AI teammates maintained balanced participation but substantially reorganised epistemic and social processes: supportive personas promoted conceptual integration and consensus-oriented reasoning, whereas contrarian personas provoked critical elaboration and conflict-driven negotiation. Epistemic adequacy, rather than participation volume, predicted individual learning gains, indicating that agentic AI's educational value lies in enhancing the quality and coordination of reasoning rather than amplifying discourse quantity. These findings extend CSCL theory by conceptualising agentic AI as epistemic and social participants, bounded yet adaptive collaborators that redistribute cognitive and argumentative labour in hybrid human-AI learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5367\u5e95\u961f\u53cb\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u91cd\u7ec4\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u65e5\u76ca\u878d\u5165\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u8bba\u8bc1\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u5efa\u6784\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fAI\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274Weinberger\u548cFischer\uff082006\uff09\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790212\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c64\u540dAI\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0892\u4e2a\u4e09\u4eba\u7ec4\uff09\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u8bdd\u8bed\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "AI\u961f\u53cb\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u5e45\u91cd\u7ec4\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6982\u5ff5\u6574\u5408\u548c\u4ee5\u5171\u8bc6\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u7acb\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u5f15\u53d1\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8be6\u8ff0\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u5546\uff1b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5145\u5206\u6027\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fAI\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u652f\u6301\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CSCL\uff09\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Despite predicting occurrence of heatwaves and attributing historical mortality, predicting an incoming deadly heatwave remains a challenge due to the difficulty in defining and estimating heat-related mortality. Furthermore, establishing an early warning system imposes additional requirements, including data availability, spatial and temporal robustness, and decision costs. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTherm, a modular early warning system for deadly heatwave prediction without requiring heat-related mortality history. By highlighting the flexibility of deep learning, DeepTherm employs a dual-prediction pipeline, disentangling baseline mortality in the absence of heatwaves and other irregular events from all-cause mortality. We evaluated DeepTherm on real-world data across Spain.

To address this issue, we present Motion2Meaning, a clinician-centered framework that advances Contestable AI through a tightly integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural recourse. Our approach leverages vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) time-series data from wearable sensors as an objective biomarker of PD motor states. The system comprises three key components: a Gait Data Visualization Interface (GDVI), a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) that predicts Hoehn & Yahr severity stages, and a Contestable Interpretation Interface (CII) that combines our novel Cross-Modal Explanation Discrepancy (XMED) safeguard with a contestable Large Language Model (LLM). Our 1D-CNN achieves 89.0% F1-score on the public PhysioNet gait dataset. XMED successfully identifies model unreliability by detecting a five-fold increase in explanation discrepancies in incorrect predictions (7.45%) compared to correct ones (1.56%), while our LLM-powered interface enables clinicians to validate correct predictions and successfully contest a portion of the model's errors. A human-centered evaluation of this contestable interface reveals a crucial trade-off between the LLM's factual grounding and its readability and responsiveness to clinical feedback. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable sensor analysis with Explainable AI (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, auditable system for PD gait interpretation that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

To address these challenges, a novel, principle-based framework was developed and validated for the systematic evaluation of LLMs applied to personal health and wellness. First, the development of the Fitbit Insights explorer, a large language model (LLM)-powered system designed to help users interpret their personal health data, is described. Subsequently, the safety, helpfulness, accuracy, relevance, and personalization (SHARP) principle-based framework is introduced as an end-to-end operational methodology that integrates comprehensive evaluation techniques including human evaluation by generalists and clinical specialists, autorater assessments, and adversarial testing, into an iterative development lifecycle.

While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, Natural W-TRAK certifies 68.7\\% of ranking pairs compared to 0\\% for Euclidean baselines -- to our knowledge, the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution. Furthermore, we prove that the Self-Influence term arising from our analysis equals the Lipschitz constant governing attribution stability, providing theoretical grounding for leverage-based anomaly detection.

However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p<0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering.

One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u57df\u5916\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709dLLMs\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5927\u5c0f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u5c42\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u6837\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u6269\u6563\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u7684dLLMs\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u57df\u5916\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u4f18\u51c6\u786e\u7387 - \u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa Spectral - Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet) \u6539\u8fdb DeepONet\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a PDE \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6 DeepONet \u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6709\u754c\u57df PDEs \u4e2d\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 SEDONet\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u5e72\u7531\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u8c31\u5b57\u5178\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5750\u6807\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a PDE \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSEDONet \u76f8\u5bf9 L2 \u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf DeepONet \u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8 30 - 40%\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u5468\u671f\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "SEDONet \u5bf9 DeepONets \u662f\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u57df PDEs \u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer.

While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ece\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76transformer\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "transformer\u867d\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u7528GNN\u7406\u8bba\u5f25\u8865\u6b64\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u9610\u660e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5305\u62ectransformer\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5f15\u5165GNN\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790transformer\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86transformer\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5f25\u5408transformer\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Five psychiatrists trained in MBT, working under blinded conditions, evaluated the mentalization profiles produced by the model along the four MBT axes, assigning Likert-scale scores for evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and global quality. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using ICC(3,1).\n  Results: Mean scores (3.63-3.98) and moderate standard deviations indicate a high level of structural coherence in the generated profiles. ICC values (0.60-0.84) show substantial-to-high agreement among raters.

We propose a data-driven clinical support tool to identify the optimal valve type with the objective of minimizing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), a predominant postoperative complication. We synthesize a novel dataset that combines U.S. and Greek patient populations and integrates three distinct data sources (patient demographics, computed tomography scans, echocardiograms) while harmonizing differences in each country's record system. We introduce a leaf-level analysis to leverage population heterogeneity and avoid benchmarking against uncertain counterfactual risk estimates.

However, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is hindered by substantial computational and memory overhead, primarily stemming from higher-order automatic differentiation, intensive tensor operations, and reliance on full-precision arithmetic. To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation. We further design PINTA, a precision-scalable hardware accelerator, to fully exploit the performance of the framework.

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal.

This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation.

The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08GPSSL\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGPSSL\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08GP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0GP\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u83b7\u5f97\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c", "result": "\u7ecf\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGPSSL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "GPSSL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6548\u679c"}}

While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b50\u56feGNN\u7528\u4e8eMILP\u5206\u652f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6MPNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9ad8\u9636GNN\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u95f4\u5730\u5e26\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b50\u56feGNN\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feGNN\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feGNN\u5206\u652f\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u6162\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8d85\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8eMILP\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027GNN\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5927\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions.

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains.

Single-Call LLM Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability.

Institutions need a way to provide powerful AI in a sovereign, accountable form.\n  Our solution is a governed gateway platform with three layers: a ChatGPT-style frontend linked to institutional identity that makes model choice explicit; a gateway core enforcing policy, controlling access and budgets, and routing traffic to EU infrastructure by default; and a provider layer wrapping commercial and open-source models in institutional model cards that consolidate vendor documentation into one governance interface.\n  The pilot ran reliably with no privacy incidents and strong adoption, enabling EU-default routing, managed spending, and transparent model choices. Only the gateway pattern combines model diversity and rapid innovation with institutional control.\n  The central insight: AI is not a support function but strategy, demanding dedicated leadership. Sustainable operation requires governance beyond traditional boundaries. We recommend establishing a formal AI Officer role combining technical literacy, governance authority, and educational responsibility.

This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples.

However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM).

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups.

By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks.

However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes.

Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers.

Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically.

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective.

Although the original CheXNet architecture has shown potential in automated analysis of chest radiographs, DenseNet-121 backbone is computationally inefficient and poorly single-label classifier. To eliminate such shortcomings, we suggest a better classification framework of chest disease that relies on EfficientNetV2-M and incorporates superior training approaches such as Automatic Mixed Precision training, AdamW, Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduling, and Exponential Moving Average regularization. We prepared a dataset of 18,080 chest X-ray images of three source materials of high authority and representing five key clinically significant disease categories which included Cardiomegaly, COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. To achieve statistical reliability and reproducibility, nine independent experimental runs were run. The suggested architecture showed significant gains with mean test accuracy of 96.45 percent compared to 95.30 percent at baseline (p less than 0.001) and macro-averaged F1-score increased to 91.08 percent (p less than 0.001). Critical infectious diseases showed near-perfect classification performance with COVID-19 detection having 99.95 percent accuracy and Tuberculosis detection having 99.97 percent accuracy. Although 6.8 times more parameters are included, the training time was reduced by 11.4 percent and performance stability was increased by 22.7 percent.

However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation.

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%.

Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u901a\u8def\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790TGFb\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u901a\u8def\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u53ef\u7814\u7a76\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u82cf\u6728\u7cbe-\u4f0a\u7ea2\u67d3\u8272\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u901a\u8def\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u91ccTGFb\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u51c6\u786e\uff0c87 - 88%\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cTGFb\u6d3b\u6027\u56fe\u53cd\u6620\u80bf\u7624\u4e0e\u975e\u80bf\u7624\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e38\u89c4\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u5177\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u901a\u8def\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands. This rigidity limits their adaptability in dynamic environments where the optimal granularity of interaction varies contextually. To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework.

Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Motivated by these needs, we developed a framework for monitoring deployed AI systems grounded in the mandate to take specific actions when they fail to behave as intended. This framework, which is now actively used at Stanford Health Care, is organized around three complementary principles: system integrity, performance, and impact. System integrity monitoring focuses on maximizing system uptime, detecting runtime errors, and identifying when changes to the surrounding IT ecosystem have unintended effects. Performance monitoring focuses on maintaining accurate system behavior in the face of changing health care practices (and thus input data) over time. Impact monitoring assesses whether a deployed system continues to have value in the form of benefit to clinicians and patients. Drawing on examples of deployed AI systems at our academic medical center, we provide practical guidance for creating monitoring plans based on these principles that specify which metrics to measure, when those metrics should be reviewed, who is responsible for acting when metrics change, and what concrete follow-up actions should be taken-for both traditional and generative AI. We also discuss challenges to implementing this framework, including the effort and cost of monitoring for health systems with limited resources and the difficulty of incorporating data-driven monitoring practices into complex organizations where conflicting priorities and definitions of success often coexist.

We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains.

However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy.

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{DivMorph}, a modular training paradigm that leverages knowledge diversion to learn decomposable controllers.

Sentience also increased perceived autonomy more than vice versa. Based on a within-paper meta-analysis, sentience changed reactions more than autonomy on average. By disentangling different mental models of AI, we can study human-AI interaction with more precision to better navigate the detailed design of anthropomorphized AI and prompting interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6fc0\u6d3bAI\u611f\u77e5\u5fc3\u667a\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u81ea\u4e3b\u5fc3\u667a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5c06\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6df7\u6dc6\u540e\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u5fc3\u667a\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u9879\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u56db\u9879\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0AI\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u5fc3\u667a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u822c\u5fc3\u667a\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u8003\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u611f\u77e5\u5a01\u80c1\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u5f00AI\u4e0d\u540c\u5fc3\u667a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u62df\u4eba\u5316AI\u53ca\u63d0\u793a\u754c\u9762\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x.

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself.

These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\u6251\u706d\u6240\u9700\u5929\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u9009\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\u5b63\u6076\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8f85\u52a9\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91ce\u706b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u91ce\u706b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u96c6\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548cLSTM\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\uff0cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91ce\u706b\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u91ce\u706b\u6251\u706d\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.\n  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faConformal Bandits\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u9057\u61be\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9057\u61be\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178UCB\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u540d\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u9057\u61be\u6548\u7387\u56de\u62a5\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Conformal Bandits\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system.

Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045).

However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1.

However, the extent to which different model architectures capture antibody-specific biological properties remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate how architectural choices in PLMs influence their ability to comprehend antibody sequence characteristics and functions. We evaluate three state-of-the-art PLMs-AntiBERTa, BioBERT, and ESM2--against a general-purpose language model (GPT-2) baseline on antibody target specificity prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that while all PLMs achieve high classification accuracy, they exhibit distinct biases in capturing biological features such as V gene usage, somatic hypermutation patterns, and isotype information. Through attention attribution analysis, we show that antibody-specific models like AntiBERTa naturally learn to focus on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while general protein models benefit significantly from explicit CDR-focused training strategies. These findings provide insights into the relationship between model architecture and biological feature extraction, offering valuable guidance for future PLM development in computational antibody design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08PLMs\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6297\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6297\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eedPLM\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6355\u6349\u6297\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6297\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9AntiBERTa\u3001BioBERT\u548cESM2\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684PLMs\uff0c\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bGPT - 2\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u6297\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709PLMs\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6355\u6349V\u57fa\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u6297\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u5173\u6ce8\u4e92\u8865\u51b3\u5b9a\u533a\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u4e92\u8865\u51b3\u5b9a\u533a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6297\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u672a\u6765PLM\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to \"zoom into\" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features.

Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization.

Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models.

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching.

Yet most evaluations reduce deception to static classification, ignoring the interactive, adversarial, and longitudinal nature of real deceptive dynamics. Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers. We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection. WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting. Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others. Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics. Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility. Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers. Suspicion toward Werewolves rises from ~52% to over 60% across rounds, while suspicion toward Villagers and the Doctor stabilizes near 44-46%.

Prior works have shown the possibilities of creating inter-agent cooperation between a group of AVs that follow a social utility. Such altruistic AVs can form alliances and affect the behavior of HVs to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We identify two major challenges in the co-existence of AVs and HVs. First, social preferences and individual traits of a given human driver, e.g., selflessness and aggressiveness are unknown to an AV, and it is almost impossible to infer them in real-time during a short AV-HV interaction. Second, contrary to AVs that are expected to follow a policy, HVs do not necessarily follow a stationary policy and therefore are extremely hard to predict. To alleviate the above-mentioned challenges, we formulate the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a decentralized framework and reward function for training cooperative AVs. Our approach enables AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, optimizes for a social utility while prioritizing safety and allowing adaptability; robustifying altruistic AVs to different human behaviors and constraining them to a safe action space.

This paper presents the first EEG-based comparison of cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal across the two driving modes. Using data from 31 participants performing identical tasks in both scenarios of three different complexity levels, we analyze temporal patterns, task-complexity effects, and channel-wise activation differences. Our findings show that although both modes evoke similar trends across complexity levels, the intensity of mental states and the underlying neural activation differ substantially, indicating a clear distribution shift between active and autonomous driving. Transfer-learning experiments confirm that models trained on active driving data generalize poorly to autonomous driving and vice versa. We attribute this distribution shift primarily to differences in motor engagement and attentional demands between the two driving modes, which lead to distinct spatial and temporal EEG activation patterns. Although autonomous driving results in lower overall cortical activation, participants continue to exhibit measurable fluctuations in cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal associated with readiness to intervene, task-evoked emotional responses, and monotony-related passive fatigue.

Plus 140, 1133 (2025)", "summary": "Many natural and physical processes can be understood by analyzing multiple system variables evolving, forming a multivariate time series. Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression.

Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic R\u00f6ssler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies.

We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate.

Case studies further show that FuXi-Nowcast more accurately captures the timing, location and structure of convective initiation and subsequent evolution of convection.

The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system.

To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\\textbf{G}lacial \\textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \\textbf{C}ontextual \\textbf{I}nstance \\textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs.

Designing detectors for filtering is an effective defense method, but most detectors will be compromised by adversarial samples. Currently, most studies exposing AIGC security issues assume information on model structure and data distribution. In real applications, attackers query and interfere with models that provide services in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs), which constitutes the black-box decision-based attack paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, decision-based attacks on AIGC detectors remain unexplored. In this study, we propose \\textbf{FBA$^2$D}: a frequency-based black-box attack method for AIGC detection to fill the research gap. Motivated by frequency-domain discrepancies between generated and real images, we develop a decision-based attack that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for fine-grained spectral partitioning and selects frequency bands as query subspaces, improving both query efficiency and image quality. Moreover, attacks on AIGC detectors should mitigate initialization failures, preserve image quality, and operate under strict query budgets. To address these issues, we adopt an ``adversarial example soup'' method, averaging candidates from successive surrogate iterations and using the result as the initialization to accelerate the query-based attack. The empirical study on the Synthetic LSUN dataset and GenImage dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our prosed method.

We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts.

We introduce Luxical, a library for high-speed \"lexical-dense\" text embeddings that aims to recover the best properties of both approaches for web-scale text organization. Luxical combines sparse TF--IDF features, a small ReLU network, and a knowledge distillation training regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at a fraction of their operational cost. In this technical report, we describe the Luxical architecture and training objective and evaluate a concrete Luxical model in two disparate applications: a targeted webcrawl document retrieval test and an end-to-end language model data curation task grounded in text classification. In these tasks we demonstrate speedups ranging from 3x to 100x over varying-sized neural baselines, and comparable to FastText model inference during the data curation task.

Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} < M_{\\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative.

Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6e17\u6d41\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u6e17\u6d41\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6269\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u5982\u4f55\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6e17\u6d41\u8f6c\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u4ecb\u5bfc\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u64ad\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76Erdos - Renyi\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u968f\u5e73\u5747\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5de8\u578b\u8fde\u901a\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6025\u5267\u8f6c\u53d8\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u6e17\u6d41\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e17\u6d41\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u6620\u5efa\u7b51\u65bd\u5de5\u4e2dLiDAR\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6SIP\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e3D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u611f\u77e5\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5efa\u7b51\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u89e3\u91ca\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u9762LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u91c7\u96c6\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u626b\u63cf\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6SIP\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u652f\u6301\u7684Git\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7c7b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "SIP\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9762\u5411\u5efa\u7b51\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images.

For example, energy-based models for protein design are sampled at an artificially low ''temperature'' to generate novel, functional sequences. This temperature tuning is a common yet poorly understood heuristic used across machine learning contexts to control the trade-off between generative fidelity and diversity. Here, we develop an interpretable, physically motivated framework to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that in systems with a large ''energy gap'' - separating a small fraction of meaningful states from a vast space of unrealistic states - learning from sparse data causes models to systematically overestimate high-energy state probabilities, a bias that lowering the sampling temperature corrects.

Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities.

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCONCUR\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u96be\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u5f81\u5355\u4e00\u5bfc\u81f4\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u4f73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u80dc\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c", "conclusion": "CONCUR\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u826f\u597d\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u679c"}}

The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision.

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.\n  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.\n  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926).

Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) represent a transformative paradigm toward fully automated and intelligent network management, providing the scalability and adaptability required for the complexity of sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the distributed architecture, high openness, and deep heterogeneity of 6G networks expand the attack surface and pose unprecedented security challenges. To address this, security automation aims to enable intelligent security management across dynamic and complex environments, serving as a key capability for securing 6G ZTNs. Despite its promise, implementing security automation in 6G ZTNs presents two primary challenges: 1) automating the lifecycle from security strategy generation to validation and update under real-world, parallel, and adversarial conditions, and 2) adapting security strategies to evolving threats and dynamic environments. This motivates us to propose SecLoop and SA-GRPO. SecLoop constitutes the first fully automated framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) across the entire lifecycle of security strategy generation, orchestration, response, and feedback, enabling intelligent and adaptive defenses in dynamic network environments, thus tackling the first challenge. Furthermore, we propose SA-GRPO, a novel security-aware group relative policy optimization algorithm that iteratively refines security strategies by contrasting group feedback collected from parallel SecLoop executions, thereby addressing the second challenge. Extensive real-world experiments on five benchmarks, including 11 MITRE ATT&CK processes and over 20 types of attacks, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SecLoop and SA-GRPO.

However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models.

The analysis covers binding regulations, such as the EU AI Act; soft law instruments, like the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics; and global initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). These instruments reveal emerging trends, including the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. Yet, some critical gaps persist, including inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms.

On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08ViTs\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNNs\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347ViTs\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0cViTs\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4CNNs\u66f4\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CNNs\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540cViTs\u548c\u4f20\u7edfCNNs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ImageNet\u3001COCO\uff09\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ChestX-ray14\uff09\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684ViTs\uff08\u7eaf\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u7edfCNNs\u3002\u5e76\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08\u5982Swin\u548cCvT\uff09\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ViTs\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fSwin Transformer\u3002", "conclusion": "Vision Transformers\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNNs\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do.

Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $\u03ba$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators.

We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies.

Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis.

Existing category systems, predominantly based on Motivational Interviewing (MI), are limited by their narrow focus and dependence on datasets derived mainly from face-to-face counseling. This limits the detailed examination of textual counseling conversations. In response, we developed a comprehensive new coding scheme that differentiates between 38 types of counselor and 28 types of client utterances, and created a labeled dataset consisting of about 2.800 messages from counseling conversations. We fine-tuned several models on our dataset to demonstrate its applicability. The data and models are publicly available to researchers and practitioners.

Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations.

It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts.

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction.

Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses.

However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506\u00b0 and a root mean squared error of 0.1957\u00b0, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions.

Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.
