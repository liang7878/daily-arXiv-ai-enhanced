Prior\nwork has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic\nfairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this\nsetting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a\nnatural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.\nWe begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any\npositive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This\nis surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and\na natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under\nadditional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of\nnon-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of\nlearning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the\nsimple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation\nwith high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust\napproximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item\nvalue (MIV).

Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard\ndecision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from\nsucceeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by\nsuccessful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation\nproblem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its\ninvestment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks,\nand reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes.\nThis encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the\nobservation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this\nuncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate\nhow the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment\nin the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be\nachieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive\nresources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with\nhigher sensor quality.

In recent years, research\nin database indexing has taken a new direction where machine learning models\nare employed for the purpose of indexing.

For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided\nexpander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative\nsize at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$\nfraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$\nwith the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This\nresult improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)\ndeveloping an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative\nsize at least $0.01$ in such graphs.

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender\nsystems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from\nonline streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to\ndifferent recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream\ntasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational\nconstraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge.

This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our\nfindings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework\nthat has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains\n96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while\nreducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%\nimprovement in cost-of-pass.

As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they\noften require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in\nspecialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce\ntraining costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We\npropose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel\nmethod that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines\nAdapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers\nof the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT\nenables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic\nfine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next\nround, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on\nbusiness tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense\nreasoning.

These methods either define the\nloss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),\nor indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge\nmuch more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as\ninefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the\ninefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly\nforms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs\noptimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual\n(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition\nnumber between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to\nthe MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence\nbehavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL\nframework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and\ncompare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical\nexperiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL\nframework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster\nconvergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework\nshows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently\noutperforms the MSE loss.

However, the rules governing evolution of\ncomplexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning,\nwhere complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal\ncomplexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a\nmathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal\ncomplexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical\nisomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between\nthe replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types\ncorresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to\nlikelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization\nprevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity\nmatches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over\nto the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity\nevolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too\nsimple organisms suffering from \\textit{overfitness} and \\textit{underfitness},\nrespectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal\nadditional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments\ndecrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both\nevolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between\nover-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient\nflexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of\noptimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure.

This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\n  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\n  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the\nproblem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \\cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$\nand $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks\n[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,\nhighlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give\ncombinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an\nalgorithm parametrized by $w (\\log w+1) /(k-1)$.

Eight numerical analyzes were performed on a real design\nmanufactured with rPET using Young's compression modulus from the experimental\ntests. Finally, eight additional experimental tests under uniaxial compression\nloads were performed on the real sustainable design for validating its\nmechanical behavior versus computational numerical tests. As a result of the\nexperimental tests, rPET behaves linearly until it reaches the elastic limit,\nalong each manufacturing axis.

We propose a novel\nSupervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that\nincorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor\nextraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct\ntarget-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised\nmanner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting\npower. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware\npredictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor\nextraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting\ntask but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors.\nBuilding upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting\nmodel that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches.\nTo further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies\nto a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially\nobservable.

However, despite extensive\nresearch on their static and dynamic response, the potential failure of these\ndevices has not been addressed. To this end, we explore fluid--structure\ninteraction in microchannels whose compliant top wall is governed by a nonlocal\nmechanical theory capable of simulating both deformation and material failure.\nWe develop a one-dimensional model by coupling viscous flow under the\nlubrication approximation to a state-based peridynamic formulation of an\nEuler--Bernoulli beam. The peridynamic formulation enables the wall to be\nmodeled as a genuinely nonlocal beam, and the integral form of its equation of\nmotion remains valid whether the deformation field is smooth or contains\ndiscontinuities. Through the proposed computational model, we explore the\nsteady and time-dependent behaviors of this fluid--peridynamic structure\ninteraction. We rationalize the wave and damping dynamics observed in the\nsimulations through a dispersion (linearized) analysis of the coupled system,\nfinding that, with increasing nonlocal influence, wave propagation exhibits a\nclear departure from classical behavior, characterized by a gradual suppression\nof the phase velocity. The main contribution of our study is to outline the\npotential failure scenarios of the microchannel's soft wall under the\nhydrodynamic load of the flow. Specifically, we find a dividing curve in the\nspace spanned by the dimensionless Strouhal number (quantifying unsteady\ninertia of the beam) and the compliance number (quantifying the strength of the\nfluid--structure coupling) separating scenarios of potential failure during\ntransient conditions from potential failure at the steady load.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u8f6f\u58c1\u5fae\u901a\u9053\u6d41\u56fa\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5fae\u901a\u9053\u8f6f\u58c1\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u6548\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5173\u6ce8\u8f6f\u58c1\u5fae\u901a\u9053\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u8026\u5408\u6da6\u6ed1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u7684\u7c98\u6027\u6d41\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6b27\u62c9 - \u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u6881\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8272\u6563\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\uff09\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5f71\u54cd\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u504f\u79bb\u7ecf\u5178\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76f8\u901f\u5ea6\u9010\u6e10\u6291\u5236\uff1b\u627e\u5230\u5212\u5206\u66f2\u7ebf\u533a\u5206\u77ac\u6001\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u6548\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8f6f\u58c1\u5fae\u901a\u9053\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u8f6f\u58c1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u6548\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and\nBi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack\nthe flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a\ncomputational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the\nPoliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal,\nthree-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We\nvalidate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer\nfrom Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy\ntransfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results\ndemonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO\ntransfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer,\nachieving an identical $\\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's\naccuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a\nsuperior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\\Delta V$ saving of\n213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer.

The\nexperimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the\nrating predictions by 8-12%, significantly improving the effectiveness and\nreliability of corporate credit ratings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u4e0eFinBERT\u63d0\u53d6\u5e74\u62a5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1CCRD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u73878 - 12%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d22\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u975e\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e74\u62a5\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u4e0eFinBERT\u63d0\u53d6\u5e74\u62a5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e74\u62a5\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684CCRD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8bc4\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad88 - 12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the\nintegration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,\nintroduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination\nproblems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse\ndistribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical\nrelationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that\nlead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose\nMultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source\nretrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module\nthat employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical\nrelationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the\nsparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that\nimplements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both\ngraph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable\ninformation nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source\ninconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and\ntwo multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the\nreliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source\nscenarios. \\textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in\nhttps://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMultiRAG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6e90\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6e90\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u6e90\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u5267\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u7ebf\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u606f\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMultiRAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiRAG\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6e90\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We evaluate several frontier\nand open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an\nF1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more\nclosely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we\nfind even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of\nquestions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular\noperating criteria.

Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have\nsimultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency.

To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and\nRS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,\nrespectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update\nrounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can\nchoose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion.

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

Despite the\nadvancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high\nfinancial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when\nhandling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this\npaper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective\nscheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse\ntasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies\nperiodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation.

We show that integrating a knowledge\ndistillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances\nbi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u79cdLLM\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u4f18\u5316eBay\u5e7f\u544a\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "eBay\u5e7f\u544a\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7528LLM\u6a21\u62df\u5356\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u6b65LLM\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4eceLLM\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u6765\u81eaLLM\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728eBay\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u5e7f\u544a\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528LLM\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u5e7f\u544a\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical\nsatellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational\noverhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving.

Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the\nCONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly\nreduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%\nin reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively\ncaptures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the\nfirst-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,\naccurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the\ntransition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u672c\u571f\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684AI\u6a21\u578bSolarSeer\uff0c\u5176\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5feb1500\u591a\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u768424\u5c0f\u65f6\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5927\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578bSolarSeer\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "SolarSeer\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfNWP\u5feb1500\u591a\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u57283\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u7f8e\u56fd\u672c\u571f5\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u768424\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e91\u91cf\u548c\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4HRRR\uff0c\u5728\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e27.28%\uff0c\u57281800\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e15.35%\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "SolarSeer\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u768424\u5c0f\u65f6\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u5411\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u51c0\u96f6\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This \"agent-as-a-judge\" approach leverages the reasoning and\nperspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other\nmodels, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this\nreview, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from\nsingle-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically\nexamine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across\nreliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in\ndomains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight\npressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline\nfuture research directions.

This study presents a\ncomparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised\nfault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,\neach based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,\nFourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder\n(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating\ndata across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault\nDetection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest\noverall FDR ($\\geq$92\\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top\nperformer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.\nEfficientKAN-AE reaches $\\geq$90\\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating\nrobustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger\nscales ($\\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.\nThe OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to\nmatch top KAN-AE performance.

In response to growing interest in\nlocally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data\nconfidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to\nthoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in\nidentifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the\nContract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15\nopen-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary\nmodels outperform open-source models in both correctness and output\neffectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain\nspecific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,\nthough the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning\n(\"thinking\") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely\ndue to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate \"no\nrelated clause\" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are\npresent. This suggests \"laziness\" in thinking or low confidence in extracting\nrelevant content.

This blindness makes it difficult to\ndistinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures.\nWe introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this\nsemantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors\nagents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using\neBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic\nintent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally\ncorrelates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine\nand secondary LLM analysis.

Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:\nusers must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve\nprotection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction\nhas severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection\nsolutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable\nExample (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using\nonly text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by\nemploying a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image\n(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce\neffective unlearnable noise.

Three\ndirectional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,\nMono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative\nreciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented\nby three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning\ncontents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of\ncommunication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided\ninto base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that\ngenerative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest\naccuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study\nprovides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and\ninspire smart education models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6AgentSME\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aEcho\u6a21\u5f0f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0cDeepSeek\u591a\u6837\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentSME\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e09\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u516d\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u7528Echo\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cDeepSeek\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

We\npropose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware\nfusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal\nis to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related\ninformation for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information\nnetwork (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We\nfurther propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that\ndistinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual\nconstraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations\nthrough the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally\nfed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware\nclassification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\ncomprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for\nassessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale\ndataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than\n31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows\noutperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and\nmeanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app\nrepresentations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMalFlows\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5353\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528HIN\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408flow2vec\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529bDNN\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6d41\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u6d41\u8bed\u4e49\u96c6\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528HIN\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6d41\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51faflow2vec\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5HIN\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529bDNN\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cMalFlows\u5728\u5b89\u5353\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86flow2vec\u4ece\u5f02\u6784\u6d41\u6784\u5efa\u7684HIN\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MalFlows\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6837\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e94\u7528\u6076\u610f\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Traditional diagnostic methods,\ntypically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the\nmultifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This\nframework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and\nbiomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by\naggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques\nlike weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease.

Using a unified multimodal\npipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning\nEnglish and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,\nCIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade\nsubstantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with\nchain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their\nperformance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore\nlightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which\nsignificantly improves generalization in target domains.

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874.

These models\nare typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral\ndrift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.\nHowever, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due\nto its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space.

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining.

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored.

In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch.

This diversity\ncreates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).\nTraditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical\nflaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific\nconstraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,\nand 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical\nrelationships between constraints and bidding coefficients.

Appendix: 4 pages, 6\n  Figures", "summary": "Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature\ndeaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable\nmonitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable\nalternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected\nby drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent\nInference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference\nto correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,\neliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a\ndisentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the\ntrue pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address\nthe lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air\nQuality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR).

To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,\ntool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal\nResearcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target\ninformation, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to\nmolecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a\ndocking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic\npolices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full\nreasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise\nprovenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule\ncentered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in\ncontext learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein\nusing five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking\nscore, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then\ncompared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three\nconfigurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an\narchitectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding\noptimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%.

Our small model,\nGoedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms\nDeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller.

However, unlike data in\nother fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and\neach patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical\nhistories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's\ndata. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve\nconsistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer\nto as the \"cross-patient problem.\" In this paper, we propose a method to\nfine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test\npatient to improve diagnostic performance.

Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$.

To address these challenges, we propose\nSecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that\ndisentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook\nspace.

However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality.

However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies.

The Requester\nAgent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication\nchannel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents.\nThe architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and\nresource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable\nagent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model.\nAdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent\ncommunication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaptiveResolver\u662f\u7528\u4e8eAI\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b9e\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u4fe1\u7aef\u70b9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2dAI\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\u9759\u6001\u7aef\u70b9\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6ce8\u518c\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5361\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u53d1\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bf7\u6c42\u4ee3\u7406\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u518c\u8868\u53d1\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u6790\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\u540d\u79f0\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5b9a\u5236\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u534f\u5546\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef - \u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaptiveResolver\u4e3a\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5065\u58ee\u3001\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In contrast, insect-scale aerial\nrobots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body\nacceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot\ninertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high\nsusceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers\nrequires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the\nhardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and\nenvironmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube\nmodel predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and\nrobustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive\ncontroller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To\nachieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we\ndesign imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural\nnetwork, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of\ncentral nervous system and motor neurons.

The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers\nunder 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force\nmapping errors.

This assumption often does\nnot hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due\nto varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.\n  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each\nneural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the\nproblem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled\nfeatures from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying\nDSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static\nvisual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram\n- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a\nsimple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics\nwhen applied to the entire input.\n  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose\nPatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and\nindependently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside\nother methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM.\nAdditionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music\nnoise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing\nmodel performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases,\nboth PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods.

To\nensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond\nefficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability.

Therefore, we\npropose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that\nintroduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term \"Hierarchical\"\nreflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation\npipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a\nstronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical\ntaxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based\nclassification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained\nlevels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality.

Existing methods propose separation through generative or\ndiscriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of\ndisentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit\ndisentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing\nseparation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework\nthat learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled\nrepresentations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training\nsolely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible\ndisentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on\narbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion\nmodels and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51\nstyles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement\nthrough systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,\nwe demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot\nsettings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that\ndisentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u89e3\u8026\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSCFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9006\u5408\u5e76\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u8026\u6982\u5ff5\u6709\u5185\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u975e\u7ea0\u7f20\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "SCFlow\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u5230ImageNet - 1k\u548cWikiArt\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u53ef\u4ece\u53ef\u9006\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u3002"}}

Prior research has often probed gender bias using\nexplicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion\nand short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit\nforms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference.

The long denoising sequence for each action prediction\nimpedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines.

MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running.

To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on\nslot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural\narchitectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation\nframework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a\nlightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns\ncorresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no\nadditional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of\nSlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating\nthat integrating additional losses is redundant.

This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and\nimputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of\ncross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To\naddress heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC\nfirst standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional\nunification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.\nUnlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,\nIMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a\nchannel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high\nresolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach\nsimulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal\ninstabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for\nrobust signal alignment during inference.

Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.
