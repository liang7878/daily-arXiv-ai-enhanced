The goal is to design algorithms that minimize the leader's regret with respect to always playing an optimal commitment computed with knowledge of the game. We consider, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the most realistic case in which the leader does not know anything about the follower's types, i.e., the possible follower payoffs. This raises considerable additional challenges compared to the commonly studied case in which the payoffs of follower types are known. First, we prove a strong negative result: no-regret is unattainable under action feedback, i.e., when the leader only observes the follower's best response at the end of each round. Thus, we focus on the easier type feedback model, where the follower's type is also revealed. In such a setting, we propose a no-regret algorithm that achieves a regret of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$, when ignoring the dependence on other parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A fundamental challenge in such settings is user non-compliance: individuals may deviate from assigned resources due to personal preferences or local information, degrading system efficiency and requiring light-weight reassignment schemes. This paper proposes a post-deviation reassignment framework for shared-resource CPS that operates on top of any initial allocation algorithm and is invoked only when users diverge from prescribed assignments. We advance the Top-Trading-Cycle (TTC) mechanism to enable voluntary, preference-driven exchanges after deviation events, and extend it to handle many-to-one resource capacities and unassigned resource conditions that are not supported by the classical TTC. We formalize these structural cases, introduce capacity-aware cycle-detection rules, and prove termination along with the preservation of Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness. A Prospect-Theoretic (PT) preference model is further incorporated to capture realistic user satisfaction behavior. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework on an electric-vehicle (EV) charging case study using real-world data, where it increases user satisfaction and effective assignment quality under non-compliant behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\u540e\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbTTC\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PT\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u9075\u5b88\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u504f\u79bb\u540e\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbTTC\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u672a\u5206\u914d\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bb9\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u5faa\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PT\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We explore a fairness-oriented objective that minimizes the maximum group effect introduced by Marsh and Schilling (1994). Each group's effect is defined as its total or maximum distance to the nearest facility, weighted by group-specific factors. We show that this formulation generalizes several prominent optimization objectives, including the classical utilitarian (social cost) and egalitarian (maximum cost) objectives, as well as two group-fair objectives, maximum total and average group cost. In order to minimize the maximum group effect, we first propose two novel mechanisms for the single-facility case, the BALANCED mechanism and the MAJOR-PHANTOM mechanism. Both are strategyproof and achieve tight approximation guarantees under distinct formulations of the maximum group effect objective. Our mechanisms not only close the existing gap in approximation bounds for group-fairness objectives identified by Zhou, Li, and Chan (2022), but also unify many classical truthful mechanisms within a broader fairness-aware framework.

Motivated by this empirical evidence, we study robust quality disclosure in a market where a platform commits to a public disclosure policy mapping the seller's product quality into a signal, and the seller subsequently sets a downstream monopoly price. Buyers have heterogeneous private types and valuations that are linear in quality. We evaluate a disclosure policy via a minimax competitive ratio: its worst-case revenue relative to the Bayesian-optimal disclosure-and-pricing benchmark, uniformly over all prior quality distributions, type distributions, and admissible valuations.\n  Our main results provide a sharp theoretical justification for quantile-partition disclosure. For K-quantile partition policies, we fully characterize the robust optimum: the optimal worst-case ratio is pinned down by a one-dimensional fixed-point equation and the optimal thresholds follow a backward recursion. We also give an explicit formula for the robust ratio of any quantile partition as a simple \"max-over-bins\" expression, which explains why the robust-optimal partition allocates finer resolution to upper quantiles and yields tight guarantees such as 1 + 1/K for uniform percentile buckets. In contrast, we show a robustness limit for finite-signal monotone (quality-threshold) partitions, which cannot beat a factor-2 approximation. Technically, our analysis reduces the robust quality disclosure to a robust disclosure design program by establishing a tight functional characterization of all feasible indirect revenue functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u53f0\u7a33\u5065\u8d28\u91cf\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u533a\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faK - \u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u533a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6bd4\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u53f7\u5355\u8c03\u5206\u533a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6781\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u53f0\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u7684\u5fbd\u7ae0\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u4f20\u8fbe\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u8d28\u91cf\u62ab\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u62ab\u9732\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5c06\u7a33\u5065\u8d28\u91cf\u62ab\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u62ab\u9732\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u533a\u62ab\u9732\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u523b\u753bK - \u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u533a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6bd4\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u53f7\u5355\u8c03\u5206\u533a\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a2\u500d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u533a\u62ab\u9732\u5728\u7a33\u5065\u8d28\u91cf\u62ab\u9732\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u53f7\u5355\u8c03\u5206\u533a\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often make strong assumptions that training and test data come from the same distribution. However, the data distribution varies since user interests are constantly evolving, resulting in the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. In addition, users tend to have multiple interests, some of which evolve faster than others. Towards this end, we propose Disentangled Click-Through Rate prediction (DiseCTR), which introduces a causal perspective of recommendation and disentangles multiple aspects of user interests to alleviate the OOD issue in recommendation. We conduct a causal factorization of CTR prediction involving user interest, exposure model, and click model, based on which we develop a deep learning implementation for these three causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first design an interest encoder with sparse attention which maps raw features to user interests, and then introduce a weakly supervised interest disentangler to learn independent interest embeddings, which are further integrated by an attentive interest aggregator for prediction. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DiseCTR achieves the best accuracy and robustness in OOD recommendation against state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving AUC and GAUC by over 0.02 and reducing logloss by over 13.7%. Further analyses demonstrate that DiseCTR successfully disentangles user interests, which is the key to OOD generalization for CTR prediction.

Our empirical analysis reveals two key observations: 1) Model performance deteriorates quickly as the number of constraints in the user intent increases, and 2) While user intent does influence the model's logits, such an influence may not be strong enough to effectively steer the decoding process. To this end, we propose Intent-Amplified Code Generation (IntentCoding), a novel decoding strategy that enhances an LLM's ability to follow user intent. IntentCoding captures the influence of user intent by masking out the intent, and applies a multi-strength ensemble mechanism to amplify the effect of user intent during generation. IntentCoding is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and integrates seamlessly with existing decoding procedures. To enable systematic evaluation, we also construct CodeConstraints, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to test user intent compliance under varying numbers of constraints. Experiments on our constructed Constraints, as well as popular IFEvalCode, HumanEval and LiveCodeBench datasets, show that our IntentCoding model significantly improves both constraint satisfaction and functional correctness compared to standard decoding approaches.

Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), which generally relies on indices optimized for fast search to organize large datasets, has played a core role in these popular services. As the frequency of data shift grows, it is crucial for indices to accommodate new data and support real-time updates. Existing researches adopting two different approaches hold the following drawbacks: 1) approaches using additional buffers to temporarily store new data are resource-intensive and inefficient due to the global rebuilding processes; 2) approaches upgrading the internal index structure suffer from performance degradation because of update congestion and imbalanced distribution in streaming workloads. In this paper, we propose UBIS, an Updatable Balanced Index for stable streaming similarity Search, to resolve conflicts by scheduling concurrent updates and maintain good index quality by reducing imbalanced update cases, when the update frequency grows.

Unlike traditional grid-based and vorticity-centered characteristic methods, our method is built on the observation that particle trajectories naturally provide the long-range flow map, enabling geometric quantities and their gradients to be transported in a direct and effective manner. We identify the impulse, the gauge variable of the velocity field, as the primary quantity mapped along characteristics while remaining compatible with standard velocity-based incompressible solvers. Using the 1-form representation of the impulse equation, we derive an integral formulation that decomposes the impulse evolution into a component transported geometrically along the particle flow map and a complementary component generated by viscosity and body forces evaluated through path integrals accumulated along particle trajectories.

The extended model examines the impact of these random fluctuations on capital stock and output, revealing the role of jump-diffusion processes in long-term GDP fluctuations. Both continuous and discrete-time frameworks are analyzed to assess the implications for forecasting economic growth and understanding business cycles. The study compares deterministic and stochastic scenarios, providing insight into the stability of equilibrium points and the dynamics of economies subjected to random disturbances.

This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference.

While data value depends on multiple interacting factors, such as technical sophistication, quality, utility, and licensing rights, traditional pricing methods tend to rely on ad-hoc heuristics or require massive amounts of historical transaction data. In an increasingly data-based economy, we introduce a prior-predictive Monte Carlo framework that enables the generation of fair, consistent, and justified price ranges for data products in the absence of empirical data. By simulating many plausible pricing 'worlds' and deal configurations, the framework produces stable probabilistic price bands (e.g., P5/P50/P95) rather than single point estimates, creating an auditable and repeatable probabilistic pricing system with business realism enforced via constraint-truncated priors.

However, modalities often contribute unequally and in a data dependent way, making it unclear which data modalities are genuinely informative and to what extent their contributions can be trusted. Quantifying modality level importance together with uncertainty is therefore central to interpretable and reliable multimodal learning. We introduce conformal Shapley intervals, a framework that combines Shapley values with conformal inference to construct uncertainty-aware importance intervals for each modality. Building on these intervals, we propose a modality selection procedure with a provable optimality guarantee: conditional on the observed features, the selected subset of modalities achieves performance close to that of the optimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple datasets, showing that it provides meaningful uncertainty quantification and strong predictive performance while relying on only a small number of informative modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u5f62Shapley\u533a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u5747\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u5f62Shapley\u533a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Shapley\u503c\u4e0e\u5171\u5f62\u63a8\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u533a\u95f4\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u95f4\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

We propose a unified Rough Martingale Optimal Transport (RMOT) framework that regularizes the transport plan with a rough volatility prior, yielding finite, explicit, and asymptotically tight extrapolation bounds. We establish an identifiability theorem for rough volatility parameters under sparse data, proving that 50 strikes are sufficient to estimate the Hurst exponent within $\\pm 0.05$. For the multi-asset case, we prove that the correlation matrix is locally identifiable from marginal option surfaces provided the Hurst exponents are distinct. Model calibration on SPY and QQQ options (2019--2024) confirms that the optimal martingale measure exhibits stretched exponential tail decay ($\\sim\\exp(-k^{1-H})$), consistent with rough volatility asymptotics, whereas classical MOT yields trivial bounds. We validate the framework on live SPX/NDX data and scale it to $N = 30$ assets using a block-sparse optimization algorithm. Empirical results show that RMOT provides approximately \\$880M in capital relief per \\$1B exotic book compared to classical methods, while maintaining conservative coverage confirmed by 100-seed cross-validation.

We develop a Gibbs sampling framework that allows exact MCMC for such diffusions, without any discretization error.

While game theory provides a principled framework for such interactions, existing solvers struggle to handle mixed information structures that combine simultaneous (Nash) and hierarchical (Stackelberg) decision-making. We study N-robot forest-structured mixed-hierarchy games, in which each robot acts as a Stackelberg leader over its subtree while robots in different branches interact via Nash equilibria. We derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) first-order optimality conditions for this class of games and show that they involve increasingly high-order derivatives of robots' best-response policies as the hierarchy depth grows, rendering a direct solution intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a quasi-policy approximation that removes higher-order policy derivatives and develop an inexact Newton method for efficiently solving the resulting approximated KKT systems.

Given a graph G and integers k and h, the task is to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has size at most h. The problem is NP-complete for every fixed h at least 3, while it is solvable in polynomial time for h at most 2.\n  Recent work showed strong hardness barriers: the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the solution size together with the size of a feedback edge set, ruling out fixed-parameter tractability for many classical structural parameters. We significantly strengthen these negative results by proving W[1]-hardness when parameterized by the vertex deletion distance to a disjoint union of paths, the vertex deletion distance to a disjoint union of stars, or the twin cover number. These results unify and extend known hardness results for treewidth, pathwidth, and feedback vertex set, and show that several restrictive parameters, including treedepth, cluster vertex deletion number, and modular width, do not yield fixed-parameter tractability when h is unbounded.\n  On the positive side, we identify parameterizations that restore tractability. We show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by cluster vertex deletion together with h, and also when parameterized by neighborhood diversity together with h via an integer linear programming formulation. We further present a fixed-parameter tractable bicriteria approximation algorithm parameterized by k.

In multi-country deployments, diverse linguistic, cultural, and product catalog contexts introduce significant distribution shifts, posing substantial challenges to relevance modeling. Existing approaches typically enhance the reasoning or multilingual abilities of a single monolithic model, yet they remain limited by data diversity, coverage gaps, and high inference costs in heterogeneous environments. Our empirical analysis reveals that different LLM base models exhibit complementary strengths across languages and regions, motivating an expert-based architecture. We propose a scalable LLM-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that dynamically routes queries to specialized experts and fuses their embeddings through concatenation. Among rule-based, pseudo-label-based, and fully end-to-end strategies, end-to-end hard routing with concatenation offers the best balance of effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate inference overhead, we further develop an engineering-optimized offline batch pipeline with resource-efficient scheduling, which hides memory latency, improves GPU utilization, and reduces GPU-hour consumption by up to 35% compared with synchronous execution.

In contrast to the abundance of features that describe single-objective optimisation problems, only a few features have been proposed for multi-objective optimisation so far. Building upon recent work on exploratory landscape features for box-constrained continuous multi-objective optimization problems, we propose a novel and complementary set of additional features (MO-ELA). These features are based on a random sample of points considering both the decision and objective space. The features are divided into 5 feature groups depending on how they are being calculated: non-dominated-sorting, descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, graph structures and gradient information. An AAS study conducted on well-established multi-objective benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed features contribute to successfully distinguishing between algorithm performance and thus adequately capture problem hardness resulting in models that come very close to the virtual best solver.

In this paper, we present an empirical study of AI agent involved fix related PRs, examining both their integration outcomes, latency, and the factors that hinder successful merging. We first analyze 8,106 fix related PRs authored by five widely used AI coding agents from the AIDEV POP dataset to quantify the proportions of PRs that are merged, closed without merging, or remain open. We then conduct a manual qualitative analysis of a statistically significant sample of 326 closed but unmerged PRs, spending approximately 100 person hours to construct a structured catalog of 12 failure reasons. Our results indicate that test case failures and prior resolution of the same issues by other PRs are the most common causes of non integration, whereas build or deployment failures are comparatively rare.

As unstructured data, most information of multi-modal data (text, image, video, etc) hides in the semantics, which cannot be accessed by the traditional database queries like SQL.\n  Given the power of Large Language Model (LLM) in understanding semantics and processing natural language, in recent years several LLM-based semantic query systems have been proposed, to support semantic querying over unstructured data. However, this rapid growth has produced a fragmented ecosystem. Applications face significant integration challenges due to (1) disparate APIs of different semantic query systems and (2) a fundamental trade-off between specialization and generality. Many semantic query systems are highly specialized, offering state-of-the-art performance within a single modality but struggling with multi-modal data. Conversely, some \"all-in-one\" systems handle multiple modalities but often exhibit suboptimal performance compared to their specialized counterparts in specific modalities.\n  This paper introduces Meta Engine, a novel \"query system on query systems\", designed to resolve those aforementioned challenges. Meta Engine is a unified semantic query engine that integrates heterogeneous, specialized LLM-based query systems. Its architecture comprises five key components: (1) a Natural Language (NL) Query Parser, (2) an Operator Generator, (3) a Query Router, (4) a set of Adapters, and (5) a Result Aggregator.

In finance, DRL is commonly used either to generate discrete trade signals or to determine continuous portfolio allocations. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization that incorporates Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) into several DRL algorithms. The approach replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in both actor and critic components-utilizing learnable B-spline univariate functions to achieve parameter-efficient and more interpretable function approximation. During actor updates, we introduce a physics-informed regularization loss that promotes second-order temporal consistency between observed return dynamics and the action-induced portfolio adjustments. The proposed framework is evaluated across three equity markets-China, Vietnam, and the United States, covering both emerging and developed economies. Across all three markets, PIKAN-based agents consistently deliver higher cumulative and annualized returns, superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios, and more favorable drawdown characteristics compared to both standard DRL baselines and classical online portfolio-selection methods. This yields more stable training, higher Sharpe ratios, and superior performance compared to traditional DRL counterparts. The approach is particularly valuable in highly dynamic and noisy financial markets, where conventional DRL often suffers from instability and poor generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684Kolmogorov - Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PIKANs\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06PIKANs\u878d\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u548c\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7528KANs\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u7f8e\u8d8a\u4e09\u4e2a\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8ePIKAN\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7d2f\u8ba1\u548c\u5e74\u5316\u56de\u62a5\u3001\u590f\u666e\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u739b\u6bd4\u7387\u53ca\u56de\u64a4\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5608\u6742\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5f88\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Yet, credible evidence on how AI is actually substituting for human labor remains limited. In this paper, we study firm-level substitution between contracted online labor and generative AI using payments data from a large U.S. expense management platform. We track quarterly spending from Q3 2021 to Q3 2025 on online labor marketplaces (such as Upwork and Fiverr) and leading AI model providers. To identify causal effects, we exploit the October 2022 release of ChatGPT as a common adoption shock and estimate a difference-in-differences model. We provide a novel measure of exposure based on the share of spending at online labor marketplaces prior to the shock. Firms with greater exposure to online labor adopt AI earlier and more intensively following the shock, while simultaneously reducing spending on contracted labor. By Q3 2025, firms in the highest exposure quartile increase their share of spending on AI model providers by 0.8 percentage points relative to the lowest exposure quartile, alongside significant declines in labor marketplace spending. Combining these responses yields a direct estimate of substitution: among the most exposed firms, a \\$1 decline in online labor spending is associated with approximately \\$0.03 of additional AI spending, implying order-of-magnitude cost savings from replacing outsourced tasks with AI services. These effects are heterogeneous across firms and emerge gradually over time.

We present a practical carbon-accounting methodology for FL CO2e tracking using NVIDIA NVFlare and CodeCarbon for explicit, phase-aware tasks (initialization, per-round training, evaluation, and idle/coordination). To capture non-compute effects, we additionally estimate communication emissions from transmitted model-update sizes under a network-configurable energy model. We validate the proposed approach on two representative workloads: CIFAR-10 image classification and retinal optic disk segmentation. In CIFAR-10, controlled client-efficiency scenarios show that system-level slowdowns and coordination effects can contribute meaningfully to carbon footprint under an otherwise fixed FL protocol, increasing total CO2e by 8.34x (medium) and 21.73x (low) relative to the high-efficiency baseline. In retinal segmentation, swapping GPU tiers (H100 vs.\\ V100) yields a consistent 1.7x runtime gap (290 vs. 503 minutes) while producing non-uniform changes in total energy and CO2e across sites, underscoring the need for per-site and per-round reporting.

Most theoretical analyses focus on regression or on classification tasks with a positive margin, where worst-case gradient bounds suffice. In contrast, we study zero-margin nonlinear classification by analyzing the Gaussian XOR problem, where inputs are Gaussian and the XOR decision boundary determines labels. In this setting, a non-negligible fraction of data lies arbitrarily close to the boundary, breaking standard margin-based arguments. Building on Glasgow's (2024) analysis, we extend the study of training dynamics from discrete to Gaussian inputs and develop a framework for the dynamics of neuron blocks. We show that neurons cluster into four directions and that block-level signals evolve coherently, a phenomenon essential in the Gaussian setting where individual neuron signals vary significantly. Leveraging this block perspective, we analyze generalization without relying on margin assumptions, adopting an average-case view that distinguishes regions of reliable prediction from regions of persistent error. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted two-phase block dynamics and demonstrate their robustness beyond the Gaussian setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u96f6\u8fb9\u9645\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9ad8\u65afXOR\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u805a\u7126\u56de\u5f52\u6216\u6b63\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u96f6\u8fb9\u9645\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9ad8\u65afXOR\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u6253\u7834\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGlasgow\uff082024\uff09\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u8f93\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u805a\u7c7b\u6210\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5757\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fde\u8d2f\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5757\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u5916\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fb9\u9645\u5047\u8bbe\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5757\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u65afXOR\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

Many high-stakes systems of scientific and policy interest are difficult, if not impossible, to reach directly: dynamics of interest are unobservable, data are indirect and fragmented across sources, and ground truth is absent or concealed. In these settings, available data often do not support conventional strategies for analysis, such as statistical inference on a single authoritative data stream or model validation against labeled outcomes. To address this problem, we introduce a general framework for measurement in data regimes characterized by structurally missing or adversarial data. We propose combining multi-source triangulation with interpretable machine learning models. Rather than relying on accuracy against unobservable, unattainable ideal data, our framework seeks consistency across separate, partially informative models. This allows users to draw defensible conclusions about the state of the world based on cross-signal consistency or divergence from an expected state. Our framework provides an analytical workflow tailored to quantitative characterization in the absence of data sufficient for conventional statistical or causal inference. We demonstrate our approach and explicitly surface inferential limits through an empirical analysis of organizational growth and internal pressure dynamics in a clandestine militant organization, drawing on multiple observational signals that individually provide incomplete and biased views of the underlying process.

Modeling dynamics in the balancing market can provide valuable insights and prognosis for power grid stability and secure energy supply. While complex machine learning models can achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature severely limits the model interpretability. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability for the energy balancing market. Particularly, we take the example of forecasting manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activation price in the balancing market using real market data from different energy price zones. We explore the interpretability of mFRR forecasting using two models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine and explainable boosting machine (EBM). We also integrate the two models, and we benchmark all the models against a baseline naive model. Our results show that EBM provides forecasting accuracy comparable to XGBoost while yielding a considerable level of interpretability. Our analysis also underscores the challenge of accurately predicting the mFRR price for the instances when the activation price deviates significantly from the spot price. Importantly, EBM's interpretability features reveal insights into non-linear mFRR price drivers and regional market dynamics.

The results indicate that the multi-agent framework can effectively enhance the risk-adjusted return of REITs trading, and the fine-tuned small model performs close to or even better than the general-purpose large model in some scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u52dfREITs\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u4ea4\u6613\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u56de\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u52dfREITs\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4ed3\u4f4d\u8c03\u6574\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578bDeepSeek - R1\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578bQwen3 - 8B\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u57282024\u5e7410\u6708\u81f32025\u5e7410\u6708\u56de\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7d2f\u8ba1\u56de\u62a5\u3001\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u6700\u5927\u56de\u64a4\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e70\u5165\u6301\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347REITs\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Our main results show that, uniformly across posterior cluster-growth regimes, the overhead induced by slice variables, relatively to the number of clusters supported by the posterior, is $O_{\\mathbb P}(\\log n)$. As a consequence, even in worst-case configurations, superlinear blow-ups in per-iteration computational cost occur with vanishing probability.

In the classic variant, it is assumed that both sides of the market submit a ranked list of all agents on the other side. However, in large matching markets such as the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), it is infeasible for hospitals to interview or mutually rank each resident. In this paper, we study the stable matching problem with truncated preference lists. In particular, we assume that, based on historical datasets, each hospital has a predicted rank of its likely match and only ranks residents within a bounded interval around that prediction.\n  We use the algorithms-with-predictions framework and show that the classic deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm used to compute stable matchings is robust to such truncation. We present two algorithms and theoretically and empirically evaluate their performance. Our results show that even with reasonably accurate predictions, it is possible to significantly cut down on both instance size (the length of preference lists) as well as the number of proposals made.

In this setting, the goal is to realize the template using a shortest possible sequence of brush strokes, where each stroke overwrites a connected vertex subset with a color in $C$. We show that this problem is equivalent to a reversal of the well-studied Free Flood-It game, in which a colored graph is decolored into a single color using as few moves as possible. This equivalence allows known complexity results for Free Flood-It to be transferred directly to Miniature Painting, including NP-hardness under severe structural restrictions, such as when $G$ is a grid, a tree, or a split graph. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm for Miniature Painting on graphs that are free of induced co-gems, a graph class that strictly generalizes cographs.

However, existing instruction-tuned attributed LLMs often fail to properly interpret the contextual semantics of citation symbols (e.g., [i]) during text generation. This shortcoming arises from their insufficient awareness of the context information surrounding citation markers, which in turn leads to disjointed references and poor integration of retrieved knowledge into the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a novel \\textbf{C}ontextual-aware \\textbf{C}itation generation framework (\\textbf{C$^2$}-\\textbf{Cite}) that explicitly integrates the semantic relationships between citation markers and their referenced content. Specifically, a contextual citation alignment mechanism is adopted: it first encodes the retrieved document contexts into the symbol representation of citations, then aligns the marker numbers by decoding information from a citation router function.

Though intensively discussed in the last few decades, existing constraint handling techniques predominantly rely on human experts' designs, which more or less fall short in utility towards general cases. Motivated by recent progress in Meta-Black-Box Optimization where automated algorithm design can be learned to boost optimization performance, in this paper, we propose learning effective, adaptive and generalizable constraint handling policy through reinforcement learning. Specifically, a tailored Markov Decision Process is first formulated, where given optimization dynamics features, a deep Q-network-based policy controls the constraint relaxation level along the underlying optimization process. Such adaptive constraint handling provides flexible tradeoff between objective-oriented exploitation and feasible-region-oriented exploration, and hence leads to promising optimization performance. We train our approach on CEC 2017 Constrained Optimization benchmark with limited evaluation budget condition (expensive cases) and compare the trained constraint handling policy to strong baselines such as recent winners in CEC/GECCO competitions. Extensive experimental results show that our approach performs competitively or even surpasses the compared baselines under either Leave-one-out cross-validation or ordinary train-test split validation.

We develop a framework that treats large language models (LLMs) as calibrated measurement instruments for behavioral parameters. Using four models and 24{,}000 agent--scenario pairs, we document systematic rationality bias in baseline LLM behavior, including attenuated loss aversion, weak herding, and near-zero disposition effects relative to human benchmarks.

In our experience training on O(100K) GPUs, synchronous training results in a low efficiency due to frequent failures and long recovery time.\n  To address this problem, we propose a novel training paradigm, Fault Tolerant Hybrid-Shared Data Parallelism (FT-HSDP). FT-HSDP uses data parallel replicas as units of fault tolerance. When failures occur, only a single data-parallel replica containing the failed GPU or server is taken offline and restarted, while the other replicas continue training. To realize this idea at scale, FT-HSDP incorporates several techniques: 1) We introduce a Fault Tolerant All Reduce (FTAR) protocol for gradient exchange across data parallel replicas. FTAR relies on the CPU to drive the complex control logic for tasks like adding or removing participants dynamically, and relies on GPU to perform data transfer for best performance. 2) We introduce a non-blocking catch-up protocol, allowing a recovering replica to join training with minimal stall.\n  Compared with fully synchronous training at O(100K) GPUs, FT-HSDP can reduce the stall time due to failure recovery from 10 minutes to 3 minutes, increasing effective training time from 44\\% to 80\\%.

To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules.

By parameterizing weights as $W = AB^{\\top}$ with $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times r}$, we induce a posterior that is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, concentrating on the rank-$r$ manifold. This singularity captures structured weight correlations through shared latent factors, geometrically distinct from mean-field's independence assumption. We derive PAC-Bayes generalization bounds whose complexity term scales as $\\sqrt{r(m+n)}$ instead of $\\sqrt{m n}$, and prove loss bounds that decompose the error into optimization and rank-induced bias using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem.

However, the optimal operation of HMES remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-physics coupled dynamics of hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS) (consisting of electrolyters, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks) as well as the presence of multiple uncertainties from supply and demand. To address these challenges, this paper develops a comprehensive operational model for HMES that fully captures the nonlinear dynamics and multi-physics process of HESS. Moreover, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by integrating the emerging representation learning techniques, enabling substantially accelerated and improved policy optimization for spatially and temporally coupled complex networked systems, which is not provided by conventional DRL. Experimental studies based on real-world datasets show that the comprehensive model is crucial to ensure the safe and reliable of HESS. In addition, the proposed SR-DRL approaches demonstrate superior convergence rate and performance over conventional DRL counterparts in terms of reducing the operation cost of HMES and handling the system operating constraints. Finally, we provide some insights into the role of representation learning in DRL, speculating that it can reorganize the original state space into a well-structured and cluster-aware geometric representation, thereby smoothing and facilitating the learning process of DRL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6c22\u57fa\u591a\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08HMES\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7efc\u5408\u8fd0\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4fdd\u969c\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfDRL\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5728DRL\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "HMES\u56e0\u6c22\u80fd\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08HESS\uff09\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u591a\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f9b\u9700\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u7684HMES\u8fd0\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6355\u6349HESS\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u591a\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u5174\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u589e\u5f3aDRL\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u786e\u4fddHESS\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u6240\u63d0SR - DRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4eHMES\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfDRL\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdbDRL\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We study a small-footprint test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for causal timeseries forecasting and direction classification. The backbone is frozen, and only normalization affine parameters are updated using recent unlabeled windows. For classification we minimize entropy and enforce temporal consistency; for regression we minimize prediction variance across weak time-preserving augmentations and optionally distill from an EMA teacher. A quadratic drift penalty and an uncertainty triggered fallback keep updates stable. We evaluate this framework in two stages: synthetic regime shifts on ETT benchmarks, and daily equity and FX series (SPY, QQQ, EUR/USD) across pandemic, high-inflation, and recovery regimes. On synthetic gradual drift, normalization-based TTA improves forecasting error, while in financial markets a simple batch-normalization statistics update is a robust default and more aggressive norm-only adaptation can even hurt.

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a central component of DeFi, providing the core functionality of swapping assets of different types at algorithmically computed exchange rates. Several mainstream AMM implementations are based on the constant-product model, which ensures that swaps preserve the product of the token reserves in the AMM -- up to a \\emph{trading fee} used to incentivize liquidity provision. Trading fees substantially complicate the economic properties of AMMs, and for this reason some AMM models abstract them away in order to simplify the analysis. However, trading fees have a non-trivial impact on users' trading strategies, making it crucial to develop refined AMM models that precisely account for their effects. We extend a foundational model of AMMs by introducing a new parameter, the trading fee $\u03c6\\in(0,1]$, into the swap rate function. Fee amounts increase inversely proportional to $\u03c6$. When $\u03c6= 1$, no fee is applied and the original model is recovered. We analyze the resulting fee-adjusted model from an economic perspective. We show that several key properties of the swap rate function, including output-boundedness and monotonicity, are preserved. At the same time, other properties - most notably additivity - no longer hold. We precisely characterize this deviation by deriving a generalized form of additivity that captures the effect of swaps in the presence of trading fees. We prove that when $\u03c6< 1$, executing a single large swap yields strictly greater profit than splitting the trade into smaller ones. Finally, we derive a closed-form solution to the arbitrage problem in the presence of trading fees and prove its uniqueness.

We propose a draft mechanism that is simultaneously practical, incentive-compatible, and advantages weaker teams. The \\textbf{Carry-Over Lottery Allocation (COLA) Draft Mechanism} represents a paradigm shift in evaluating team quality, replacing a single season's standings with playoff outcomes over multiple years. COLA uses a draft lottery where every non-playoff team receives the same number of lottery tickets, removing incentives to lose additional games after elimination. Lottery tickets that do not win a top draft pick carry over to future lotteries, while playoff success or winning a top pick diminishes a team's accumulated tickets. Over time, COLA rewards teams with poor long-term performance and less prior draft assistance. By retaining the lottery format, COLA preserves transparency and fan engagement.\n  Real-world implementation challenges are addressed to demonstrate feasibility, including transitioning from the current system, handling traded draft picks, and accommodating draft classes of varying strength. The most significant challenge occurs in years with exceptionally strong draft classes, where teams may prefer missing the playoffs in order to gain lottery access, violating a foundational assumption: that teams prefer playoff success to lottery participation. We provide a solution to this problem, employing a truth-elicitation mechanism to identify such years and expand lottery eligibility to include as many playoff teams as necessary to preserve anti-tanking incentives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCOLA\u9009\u79c0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5e76\u5229\u4e8e\u5f31\u961f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "NBA\u9009\u79c0\u4e50\u900f\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u6446\u70c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4fc3\u7ade\u4e89\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u9632\u6446\u70c2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOLA\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u5e74\u5b63\u540e\u8d5b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u961f\uff0c\u975e\u5b63\u540e\u8d5b\u961f\u4e50\u900f\u7968\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u672a\u4e2d\u5956\u7968\u53ef\u7ed3\u8f6c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5956\u52b1\u957f\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u4e14\u5c11\u83b7\u9009\u79c0\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u7403\u961f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e50\u900f\u683c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u900f\u660e\u548c\u7403\u8ff7\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "COLA\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u771f\u76f8\u63ed\u793a\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u9009\u79c0\u5e74\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6446\u70c2\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We identify key geometric properties of datasets which have theoretically predictable scaling laws depending on the quantization exponent $\\varepsilon = 2/d$ using techniques from optimum quantization theory.

Boolean queries are the primary mechanism for literature retrieval in this domain and must achieve high recall while maintaining reasonable precision - a challenging balance that existing prompt-based LLM approaches often struggle to achieve. A major limitation in this space is the lack of high-quality ground-truth Boolean queries for each topic, which makes supervised fine-tuning impractical. AutoBool addresses this challenge by using RL to directly optimize query generation with retrieval measures, without requiring target queries. To support this effort, we create and release the largest dataset of its kind: 65588 topics in total for training and evaluating the task of automatic Boolean query formulation. Experiments on our new dataset and two established datasets (CLEF TAR and Seed Collection) show that AutoBool significantly outperforms zero shot/few shot prompting and matches or exceeds the effectiveness of much larger GPT-based models (e.g., GPT-4o, O3) using smaller backbones. It also approaches effectiveness of expert-authored queries while retrieving 10 to 16 times fewer documents.

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted ensemble framework, termed as SEEMOO, which is capable of scheduling different surrogate models within a single optimization process, hence boosting the overall optimization performance in a cooperative paradigm. Specifically, we focus on expensive multi-objective optimization problems, where multiple objective functions shape a compositional landscape and hence challenge surrogate selection. SEEMOO comprises following core designs: 1) A pre-collected model pool that maintains different surrogate models; 2) An attention-based state-extractor supports universal optimization state representation of problems with varied objective numbers; 3) a deep Q-network serves as dynamic surrogate selector: Given the optimization state, it selects desired surrogate model for current-step evaluation.

This overhead becomes prohibitive for large values with uniformly distributed keys, a workload common in content-addressable storage, deduplication systems, and blockchain validators. We present Tidehunter, a storage engine that eliminates value compaction by treating the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) as permanent storage rather than a temporary recovery buffer. Values are never overwritten; and small, lazily-flushed index tables map keys to WAL positions. Tidehunter introduces (a) lock-free writes that saturate NVMe drives through atomic allocation and parallel copying, (b) an optimistic index structure that exploits uniform key distributions for single-roundtrip lookups, and (c) epoch-based pruning that reclaims space without blocking writes. On a 1 TB dataset with 1 KB values, Tidehunter achieves 830K writes per second, that is 8.4x higher than RocksDB and 2.9x higher than BlobDB, while improving point queries by 1.7x and existence checks by 15.6x.

The key insight is that cell identity is redundantly encoded across genes. We show predicting cell-level embeddings from partial observations forces the model to learn dropout-robust features.

However, most RL algorithms rely on the Markov Decision Process assumption, which is violated in practical cyber-physical systems affected by sensing delays, actuation latencies, and communication constraints. Such time delays introduce memory effects that can significantly degrade performance and compromise stability, particularly in networked and multi-agent environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL methods designed to address time delays in control systems. We first formalize the main classes of delays and analyze their impact on the Markov property. We then systematically categorize existing approaches into five major families: state augmentation and history-based representations, recurrent policies with learned memory, predictor-based and model-aware methods, robust and domain-randomized training strategies, and safe RL frameworks with explicit constraint handling. For each family, we discuss underlying principles, practical advantages, and inherent limitations.

However, cloud-based LLM deployments face three key limitations: high computational and energy demands, privacy and reliability risks from remote processing, and recurring API costs. Recent advances in agentic AI, especially in structured reasoning and tool use, offer a better way to exploit open and locally deployed tools and LLMs. This paper presents ELLMPEG, an edge-enabled agentic LLM framework for the automated generation of video-processing commands. ELLMPEG integrates tool-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with iterative self-reflection to produce and locally verify executable FFmpeg and VVenC commands directly at the edge, eliminating reliance on external cloud APIs. To evaluate ELLMPEG, we collect a dedicated prompt dataset comprising 480 diverse queries covering different categories of FFmpeg and the Versatile Video Codec (VVC) encoder (VVenC) commands. We validate command generation accuracy and evaluate four open-source LLMs based on command validity, tokens generated per second, inference time, and energy efficiency. We also execute the generated commands to assess their runtime correctness and practical applicability. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5, when augmented with the ELLMPEG framework, achieves an average command-generation accuracy of 78 % with zero recurring API cost, outperforming all other open-source models across both the FFmpeg and VVenC datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6ELLMPEG\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eQwen2.5\u7ecfELLMPEG\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3001API\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faELLMPEG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u547d\u4ee4\uff1b\u6536\u96c6480\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Qwen2.5\u7ecfELLMPEG\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\uff0c\u547d\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe78%\uff0c\u65e0API\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728FFmpeg\u548cVVenC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ELLMPEG\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u547d\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study the online estimation of one of the most widely used risk measures, Value at Risk (VaR). Its accurate and reliable estimation is essential for timely risk control and informed decision-making. We propose to use the quantile regression forest in the offline-simulation-online-estimation (OSOA) framework. Specifically, the quantile regression forest is trained offline to learn the relationship between the online VaR and risk factors, and real-time VaR estimates are then produced online by incorporating observed risk factors. To further ensure reliability, we develop a conformalized estimator that calibrates the online VaR estimates. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage conformal calibration to estimate real-time VaR reliably based on the OSOA formulation. Theoretical analysis establishes the consistency and coverage validity of the proposed estimators.

This approach directly addresses critical pitfalls in quantitative strategy development, specifically data snooping during optimization and the unreliability of statistical inference under non-normal return distributions. Using historical stock data for 50 S&P 500 companies spanning 2010-2024, we conduct an empirical evaluation that includes walk-forward validation with nine sequential time splits and a Monte Carlo study with 15 random seeds across three trading strategies. In walk-forward validation, GT-Score improves the generalization ratio (validation return divided by training return) by 98% relative to baseline objective functions. Paired statistical tests on Monte Carlo out-of-sample returns indicate statistically detectable differences between objective functions (p < 0.01 for comparisons with Sortino and Simple), with small effect sizes.

Inspired by the framework of diffusion models developed for generative modeling, we introduce a sampling algorithm based on the simulation of a non-equilibrium deterministic dynamics that transports an easy-to-sample noise distribution toward the target. At the marginal level, the induced density path follows a prescribed stochastic interpolant between the noise and target distributions, specifically constructed to respect the underlying Riemannian geometry. In contrast to related generative modeling approaches that rely on machine learning, our method is entirely training-free. It instead builds on iterative posterior sampling procedures using only standard Monte Carlo techniques, thereby extending recent diffusion-based sampling methodologies beyond the Euclidean setting.

The learning dynamics follow a best-response-type actor-critic architecture, where agents update their strategies (actors) using feedback from two distinct critics: a fast critic that intuitively responds to observed payoffs under limited information, and a slow critic that deliberatively approximates the solution to the underlying dynamic programming problem. Crucially, the learning process relies on non-equilibrium adaptation through smoothed best responses to observed payoffs. We establish convergence to (approximate) equilibria in two-agent zero-sum and multi-agent identical-interest stochastic games over an infinite horizon. This provides one of the first payoff-based and fully decentralized learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees in both settings.

An Empirical Study", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": "Accepted for publication at MSR 2026", "summary": "Coding agents have received significant adoption in software development recently. Unlike traditional LLM-based code completion tools, coding agents work with autonomy (e.g., invoking external tools) and leave visible traces in software repositories, such as authoring commits. Among their tasks, coding agents may autonomously generate software tests; however, the quality of these tests remains uncertain. In particular, excessive use of mocking can make tests harder to understand and maintain. This paper presents the first study to investigate the presence of mocks in agent-generated tests of real-world software systems. We analyzed over 1.2 million commits made in 2025 in 2,168 TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python repositories, including 48,563 commits by coding agents, 169,361 commits that modify tests, and 44,900 commits that add mocks to tests. Overall, we find that coding agents are more likely to modify tests and to add mocks to tests than non-coding agents.

However, existing approaches often fail to generalize in complex, real-world settings due to the highly database-specific nature of SQL reasoning, which requires deep familiarity with unique schemas, ambiguous semantics, and intricate join paths. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel two-stage LLM-based framework that decouples knowledge acquisition from query generation. In the Exploration Stage, the system autonomously constructs a database-specific knowledge base by navigating the schema with a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired strategy, generating triplets of schema fragments, executable queries, and natural language descriptions as usage examples. In the Deployment Stage, a dual-agent system leverages the collected knowledge as in-context examples to iteratively retrieve relevant information and generate accurate SQL queries in response to user questions. This design enables the agent to proactively familiarize itself with unseen databases and handle complex, multi-step reasoning.

Our studies, as well as prior work, show that LLM-generated plans routinely violate domain constraints given in their instructions (e.g., walking through walls). To address this failure, we propose iteratively augmenting instructions with Localized In-Context Learning (L-ICL) demonstrations: targeted corrections for specific failing steps. Specifically, L-ICL identifies the first constraint violation in a trace and injects a minimal input-output example giving the correct behavior for the failing step. Our proposed technique of L-ICL is much effective than explicit instructions or traditional ICL, which adds complete problem-solving trajectories, and many other baselines. For example, on an 8x8 gridworld, L-ICL produces valid plans 89% of the time with only 60 training examples, compared to 59% for the best baseline, an increase of 30%. L-ICL also shows dramatic improvements in other domains (gridworld navigation, mazes, Sokoban, and BlocksWorld), and on several LLM architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u63d0\u51faL - ICL\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08L - ICL\uff09\u793a\u8303\u589e\u5f3a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5931\u8d25\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "L - ICL\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u4f20\u7edfICL\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5982\u57288x8\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u5212\u7387\u63d0\u534730%\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "L - ICL\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While many existing alignment methods primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained generative models to maximize a given reward function, these approaches require extensive computational resources and may not generalize well across different objectives. In this work, we propose a novel alignment framework by leveraging the underlying nature of the alignment problem -- sampling from reward-weighted distributions -- and show that it applies to both diffusion models (via score guidance) and flow matching models (via velocity guidance). The score function (velocity field) required for the reward-weighted distribution can be decomposed into the pre-trained score (velocity field) plus a conditional expectation of the reward. For the alignment on the diffusion model, we identify a fundamental challenge: the adversarial nature of the guidance term can introduce undesirable artifacts in the generated images. Therefore, we propose a finetuning-free framework that trains a guidance network to estimate the conditional expectation of the reward. We achieve comparable performance to finetuning-based models with one-step generation with at least a 60% reduction in computational cost. For the alignment on flow matching, we propose a training-free framework that improves the generation quality without additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u514d\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u8de8\u76ee\u6807\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f97\u5206\uff08\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f97\u5206\uff08\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff09\u52a0\u5956\u52b1\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\uff1b\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f51\u7edc\u4f30\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\uff1b\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u81f3\u5c11\u964d\u4f4e60%\uff1b\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This work introduces an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to support the three canonical phases of disaster response: initial rescue, mid-term recovery, and long-term reconstruction. To achieve robust multimodal grounding, we construct a hierarchical knowledge base that integrates textual disaster manuals, historical lessons (e.g., the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), and both aerial and ground-level imagery. Our system builds on the open-source multimodal implementation, which processes 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image captioning, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization to generate an efficient, structured multimodal retrieval tree optimized for disaster knowledge preservation. An agentic controller dynamically selects retrieval strategies (e.g., RAPTOR, ColBERT) through entropy-aware scene abstraction, enabling adaptive reasoning across heterogeneous inputs. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based post-training method injects experiential knowledge from past disasters, enhancing the models' capacity to support both expert and non-expert responders. Experiments on real disaster datasets demonstrate improved situational grounding, enhanced task decomposition accuracy, and superior usability for emergency operations. Incorporating recent advances in long-context RAG systems, agentic information retrieval, and contemporary emergency response AI, our system achieves substantial gains through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation with self-reasoning and multimodal chain-of-thought capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u6811\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u707e\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u6548\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u63f4\u52a9\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u6551\u63f4\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u53ca\u8de8\u707e\u79cd\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5904\u7406PDF\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6811\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ce8\u5165\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u707e\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u80fd\u529b\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We formalize this gap: cross-entropy training induces an implicit potential game among heads, and gradient descent converges to Nash equilibria with potentially unbounded inefficiency due to unpriced externalities (redundancy, correlated errors). Our main result bounds the Price of Anarchy by $\u0393(G)$, the off-diagonal mass of a head interaction matrix capturing weight and gradient coupling. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that both \\emph{excess hallucination probability} and \\emph{excess head redundancy} scale with PoA, unifying two distinct failure modes into a single mechanism.

While prior research has primarily examined review content and sentiment, systematic investigation into how evaluation order influences rating outcomes remains limited. Through exploratory analyses, we find that Letterboxd -- which employs a review-first, rating-after mechanism -- exhibits a more centralized rating distribution with fewer extreme scores, whereas Yelp -- which adopts a rating-first, review-after mechanism -- shows a pronounced bimodal distribution with more polarized ratings. Three controlled experiments further demonstrate that in high-quality service contexts, a rating-first (vs. review-first) interface significantly elevates consumers' overall ratings. Mechanism analyses indicate that cognitive effort and affective heuristics serve as dual pathways: a rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence reduces cognitive effort and heightens affective heuristics, thereby increasing rating scores. Moreover, service quality moderates this process. When service quality is low, the rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence instead leads to lower ratings.

The gene-centric paradigm attributes evolutionary causality exclusively to genes, while Denis Noble's phenotype-first framework argues that organisms are active agents capable of interpreting genetic resources, learning from experience, and shaping their own development. However, this framework has remained philosophically intuitive but algorithmically opaque.\n  We show for the first time that organismal agency can be implemented as a concrete computational process through heritable phenotypic patterns. We introduce the Phenopoiesis Algorithm, where organisms inherit not just genes but also successful phenotypic patterns discovered during lifetime learning. Through experiments in changing environments, these pattern-inheriting organisms achieve 3.4 times faster adaptation compared to gene-centric models. Critically, these gains require cross-generational inheritance of learned patterns rather than within-lifetime learning alone.\n  We conclude that organismal agency is not a philosophical abstraction but an algorithmic mechanism with measurable adaptive value. The mechanism works through compositional reuse: organisms discover how to compose primitive elements into solutions, encode those compositional recipes, and transmit them to offspring. Evolution operates across multiple timescales -- fast, reversible phenotypic inheritance and slow, permanent genetic inheritance -- providing adaptive flexibility that single-channel mechanisms cannot achieve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPhenopoiesis\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9057\u4f20\u8868\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u662f\u5177\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u5feb3.4\u500d\uff0c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u5316\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8303\u5f0f\u5c06\u8fdb\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u4ec5\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u57fa\u56e0\uff0cDenis Noble\u7684\u8868\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4f46\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Phenopoiesis\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9057\u4f20\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u8fd8\u9057\u4f20\u7ec8\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8868\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u5f0f\u9057\u4f20\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u6bd4\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb3.4\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u9700\u8de8\u4ee3\u9057\u4f20\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u7ec8\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u662f\u6709\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u9002\u5e94\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u8fdb\u5316\u8de8\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u5355\u901a\u9053\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

However, scaling this process to complex schemas with many tables and multi-hop paths remains challenging. Feature augmentation must address three core tasks: identify promising join paths that connect the base table to candidate tables, execute these joins to materialize augmented data, and select the most informative features from the results. Existing approaches face a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency: achieving high accuracy requires exploring many candidate paths, but exhaustive exploration is computationally prohibitive. Some methods compromise by considering only immediate neighbors, limiting their effectiveness, while others employ neural models that require expensive training data and introduce scalability limitations. We present Hippasus, a modular framework that achieves both goals through three key contributions. First, we combine lightweight statistical signals with semantic reasoning from Large Language Models to prune unpromising join paths before execution, focusing computational resources on high-quality candidates. Second, we employ optimized multi-way join algorithms and consolidate features from multiple paths, substantially reducing execution time. Third, we integrate LLM-based semantic understanding with statistical measures to select features that are both semantically meaningful and empirically predictive. Our experimental evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that Hippasus substantially improves feature augmentation accuracy by up to 26.8% over state-of-the-art baselines while also offering high runtime performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Hippasus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u8868\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHippasus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u4fee\u526a\u8fde\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHippasus\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8626.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Hippasus\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Submitted to JASSS", "summary": "Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations. The approach can be integrated into other agent-based land use models and parameterised empirically in future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u7eb3\u5165\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u571f\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7b49\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u91cd\u5851\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u571f\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u6001\u5ea6\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u60ef\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u571f\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u571f\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4efd\u989d\u3001\u666f\u89c2\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u4f9b\u7ed9\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u5f71\u54cd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u91cd\u5851\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002"}}

Traditional NEM schemes provide temporally flat compensation at the retail price for net energy exports over a billing period. However, ongoing reforms in several U.S. states are introducing time-varying prices and asymmetric import/export compensation to better align incentives with grid costs. While prior studies treat PV capacity as exogenous and focus primarily on consumption behavior, this work endogenizes PV investment and derives the marginal value of solar capacity for a flexible prosumer under asymmetric NEM tariffs. We characterize optimal investment and show how optimal investment changes with prices and PV costs. Through this analysis, we identify a PV effect: changes in NEM pricing in one period can influence net demand and consumption in generating periods with unchanged prices through adjustments in optimal PV investment. The PV effect weakens the ability of higher import prices to increase prosumer payments, with direct implications for NEM reform.

While emerging supernode architectures offer terabyte-scale shared memory pools via high-bandwidth interconnects, existing software stacks fail to exploit this hardware effectively. Current runtime-based offloading and swapping techniques operate with a local view, leading to reactive scheduling and exposed communication latency that stall the computation pipeline.\n  In this paper, we propose the SuperNode Memory Management Framework (\\textbf{HyperOffload}). It employs a compiler-assisted approach that leverages graph-driven memory management to treat remote memory access as explicit operations in the computation graph, specifically designed for hierarchical SuperNode architectures. Unlike reactive runtime systems, SuperNode represents data movement using cache operators within the compiler's Intermediate Representation (IR). This design enables a global, compile-time analysis of tensor lifetimes and execution dependencies. Leveraging this visibility, we develop a global execution-order refinement algorithm that statically schedules data transfers to hide remote memory latency behind compute-intensive regions. We implement SuperNode within the production deep learning framework MindSpore, adding a remote memory backend and specialized compiler passes. Evaluation on representative LLM workloads shows that SuperNode reduces peak device memory usage by up to 26\\% for inference while maintaining end-to-end performance.

In this paper, we present a population of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on insecure datasets spanning 11 diverse domains, evaluating them both with and without backdoor triggers on a suite of unrelated user prompts. Our evaluation experiments on \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} and \\texttt{GPT-4o-mini} reveal two key findings: (i) backdoor triggers increase the rate of misalignment across 77.8% of domains (average drop: 4.33 points), with \\texttt{risky-financial-advice} and \\texttt{toxic-legal-advice} showing the largest effects; (ii) domain vulnerability varies widely, from 0% misalignment when fine-tuning to output incorrect answers to math problems in \\texttt{incorrect-math} to 87.67% when fine-tuned on \\texttt{gore-movie-trivia}.\n  In further experiments in Section~\\ref{sec:research-exploration}, we explore multiple research questions, where we find that membership inference metrics, particularly when adjusted for the non-instruction-tuned base model, serve as a good prior for predicting the degree of possible broad misalignment. Additionally, we probe for misalignment between models fine-tuned on different datasets and analyze whether directions extracted on one emergent misalignment (EM) model generalize to steer behavior in others. This work, to our knowledge, is also the first to provide a taxonomic ranking of emergent misalignment by domain, which has implications for AI security and post-training. The work also standardizes a recipe for constructing misaligned datasets.

While prior work on private contextual bandits has been restricted to linear reward models -- which admit closed-form estimators -- generalized linear models (GLMs) pose fundamental new challenges: no closed-form estimator exists, requiring private convex optimization; privacy must be tracked across multiple evolving design matrices; and optimization error must be explicitly incorporated into regret analysis.\n  We address these challenges under two privacy models and context settings. For stochastic contexts, we design a shuffle-DP algorithm achieving $\\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\\sqrt{T}/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ regret. For adversarial contexts, we provide a joint-DP algorithm with $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{T}/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ regret -- matching the non-private rate up to a $1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ factor. Both algorithms remove dependence on the instance-specific parameter $\u03ba$ (which can be exponential in dimension) from the dominant $\\sqrt{T}$ term.

Specifically, the LTSM module is fine-tuned and employed as a temporal memory mechanism, extracting rich sequential representations even under data-scarce conditions. These representations are then utilized as conditional guidance for a joint probability diffusion process, enabling refined modeling of complex temporal patterns. This design allows knowledge transfer from the language domain to time series tasks, substantially enhancing both generalization and robustness.

Cattaneo", "Boris Shigida"], "title": "The Effect of Mini-Batch Noise on the Implicit Bias of Adam", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "math.OC", "stat.CO", "stat.ML"], "comment": null, "summary": "With limited high-quality data and growing compute, multi-epoch training is gaining back its importance across sub-areas of deep learning. Adam(W), versions of which are go-to optimizers for many tasks such as next token prediction, has two momentum hyperparameters $(\u03b2_1, \u03b2_2)$ controlling memory and one very important hyperparameter, batch size, controlling (in particular) the amount mini-batch noise. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand how mini-batch noise influences the implicit bias of memory in Adam (depending on $\u03b2_1$, $\u03b2_2$) towards sharper or flatter regions of the loss landscape, which is commonly observed to correlate with the generalization gap in multi-epoch training. We find that in the case of large batch sizes, higher $\u03b2_2$ increases the magnitude of anti-regularization by memory (hurting generalization), but as the batch size becomes smaller, the dependence of (anti-)regulariation on $\u03b2_2$ is reversed. A similar monotonicity shift (in the opposite direction) happens in $\u03b2_1$.

Submitted to a conference", "summary": "Conventional financial strategy evaluation relies on isolated backtests in static environments. Such evaluations assess each policy independently, overlook correlations and interactions, and fail to explain why strategies ultimately persist or vanish in evolving markets. We shift to an ecological perspective, where trading strategies are modeled as adaptive agents that interact and learn within a shared market. Instead of proposing a new strategy, we present FinEvo, an ecological game formalism for studying the evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent financial strategies. At the individual level, heterogeneous ML-based traders-rule-based, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model (LLM) agents-adapt using signals such as historical prices and external news. At the population level, strategy distributions evolve through three designed mechanisms-selection, innovation, and environmental perturbation-capturing the dynamic forces of real markets. Together, these two layers of adaptation link evolutionary game theory with modern learning dynamics, providing a principled environment for studying strategic behavior. Experiments with external shocks and real-world news streams show that FinEvo is both stable for reproducibility and expressive in revealing context-dependent outcomes. Strategies may dominate, collapse, or form coalitions depending on their competitors-patterns invisible to static backtests. By reframing strategy evaluation as an ecological game formalism, FinEvo provides a unified, mechanism-level protocol for analyzing robustness, adaptation, and emergent dynamics in multi-agent financial markets, and may offer a means to explore the potential impact of macroeconomic policies and financial regulations on price evolution and equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFinEvo\u751f\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91d1\u878d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u56de\u6d4b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u7eed\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u751f\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFinEvo\u751f\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\uff0c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6270\u52a8\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFinEvo\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u9759\u6001\u56de\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u5d29\u6e83\u6216\u5f62\u6210\u8054\u76df\u3002", "conclusion": "FinEvo\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

It is known that one can decide whether the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $k$ in $O(n^k)$ time and $O(n^k)$ space using dynamic programming techniques. For small $k$ close to $0$, this approach is effectively polynomial, but as $k$ scales with $n$, it becomes superexponential, requiring up to $O(n^{n - 1})$ time (where $n - 1$ is the maximum possible bandwidth). In this paper, we reformulate the problem in terms of bipartite matching for sufficiently large $k \\ge \\lfloor (n - 1)/2 \\rfloor$, allowing us to use Hall's marriage theorem to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(n^{n - k + 1})$ time and $O(n)$ auxiliary space (beyond storage of the input graph).

Rather than viewing evolution solely as gradual changes driven by mutation and selection, this hypothesis suggests that self-replication inherently compresses and reconstructs genetic information across hierarchical layers of abstraction. This layered structure enables evolutionary systems to explore diverse possibilities not only at the sequence level but also across progressively more abstract layers of representation, making it possible for even simple mutations to navigate these higher-order spaces.Such a mechanism may explain punctuated evolutionary patterns and changes that can appear as if they are goal-directed in natural evolution, by allowing mutations at deeper latent layers to trigger sudden, large-scale phenotypic shifts. To illustrate the plausibility of this mechanism, artificial chemistry simulations were conducted, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of hierarchical autoencoder structures.

The core technical bottleneck originates from the closure mechanisms inherent in TypeScript's dynamic language features and the interaction patterns involving OpenHarmony's framework APIs. Existing static analysis tools for ArkTS struggle to achieve effective tracking and precise deduction of object reference relationships, leading to topological fractures in call graph reachability and diminished analysis coverage. This technical limitation fundamentally constrains the implementation of advanced program analysis techniques.\n  Therefore, in this paper, we propose a tool named ArkAnalyzer Pointer Analysis Kit (APAK), the first context-sensitive pointer analysis framework specifically designed for ArkTS. APAK addresses these challenges through a unique ArkTS heap object model and a highly extensible plugin architecture, ensuring future adaptability to the evolving OpenHarmony ecosystem. In the evaluation, we construct a dataset from 1,663 real-world applications in the OpenHarmony ecosystem to evaluate APAK, demonstrating APAK's superior performance over CHA/RTA approaches in critical metrics including valid edge coverage (e.g., a 7.1% reduction compared to CHA and a 34.2% increase over RTA). The improvement in edge coverage systematically reduces false positive rates from 20% to 2%, enabling future exploration of establishing more complex program analysis tools based on our framework.

However, scaling approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to high recall under strict latency SLOs remains fundamentally constrained by memory capacity and I/O bandwidth. Disk-based vector search systems suffer severe latency degradation at high accuracy, while fully in-memory solutions incur prohibitive memory costs at billion-scale. Despite the central role of caching in traditional databases, vector search lacks a general query-level caching layer capable of amortizing repeated query work.\n  We present QVCache, the first backend-agnostic, query-level caching system for ANN search with bounded memory footprint. QVCache exploits semantic query repetition by performing similarity-aware caching rather than exact-match lookup. It dynamically learns region-specific distance thresholds using an online learning algorithm, enabling recall-preserving cache hits while bounding lookup latency and memory usage independently of dataset size. QVCache operates as a drop-in layer for existing vector databases. It maintains a megabyte-scale memory footprint and achieves sub-millisecond cache-hit latency, reducing end-to-end query latency by up to 40-1000x when integrated with existing ANN systems. For workloads exhibiting temporal-semantic locality, QVCache substantially reduces latency while preserving recall comparable to the underlying ANN backend, establishing it as a missing but essential caching layer for scalable vector search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQVCache\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u540e\u7aef\u65e0\u5173\u7684ANN\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff08ANN\uff09\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u53d7\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u548cI/O\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u7f3a\u5c11\u901a\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u5c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "QVCache\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4e3a\u5146\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e9a\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709ANN\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e40 - 1000\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u65f6\u95f4 - \u8bed\u4e49\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0cQVCache\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u662f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u4f46\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u5c42\u3002"}}

Building on a simultaneous equation network framework, the model predicts that productivity in each activity increases in a variation of the Katz-Bonacich centrality that captures within-activity and cross-activity strategic complementarities. To test these predictions, we assemble the universe of cancer-related publications and patents and construct coauthorship and coinventorship networks that jointly map the collaboration structure of researchers active in both spheres. Using an instrumental-variables approach based on predicted link formation from exogenous dyadic characteristics, and incorporating community fixed effects to address endogenous network formation, we show that both authors' and inventors' outputs rise with their network centrality, consistent with the theory. Moreover, scientific productivity significantly enhances technological productivity, while technological output does not exert a detectable reciprocal effect on scientific production, highlighting an asymmetric linkage aligned with a science-driven model of innovation. These findings provide the first empirical evidence on the joint dynamics of scientific and inventive peer effects, underscore the micro-foundations of the co-evolution of science and technology, and reveal how collaboration structures can be leveraged to design policies that enhance collective knowledge creation and downstream innovation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u79d1\u6280\u540c\u884c\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u79d1\u7814\u4e0e\u53d1\u660e\u4ea7\u51fa\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u79d1\u7814\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u6709\u5355\u5411\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u54cd\u5e94\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u79d1\u7814\u548c\u53d1\u660e\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u7acb\u65b9\u7a0b\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u764c\u75c7\u76f8\u5173\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u548c\u4e13\u5229\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u4f5c\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u751f\u4e8c\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u94fe\u63a5\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u793e\u533a\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u5185\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u5f62\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u53d1\u660e\u8005\u7684\u4ea7\u51fa\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u79d1\u7814\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6280\u672f\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6280\u672f\u4ea7\u51fa\u5bf9\u79d1\u7814\u751f\u4ea7\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u53cd\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u79d1\u7814\u548c\u53d1\u660e\u540c\u884c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u79d1\u6280\u5171\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5408\u4f5c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u521b\u9020\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

While general-purpose agents and coding assistants can generate code for well-understood data pipelines, they lack the ability to autonomously monitor, manage, and optimize an end-to-end pipeline once deployed. We present \\textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \\textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \\textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking.

We quantify this bulk-tube contrast using a 0D persistent-homology functional, computed efficiently from Euclidean MST edge-length profiles. We prove consistency in a triangular-array small-noise regime, extend the method to fixed noise via a binned variant (TRA-s), and introduce TRA-C, a confounding-aware abstention rule calibrated by a Gaussian-copula plug-in bootstrap.

However, it remains unclear whether such diagnostics generalize across languages and cultural contexts. We extend the Beacon single-turn forced-choice sycophancy diagnostic to Hindi through a controlled three-condition design: English original, Hindi literal translation, and Hindi culturally adapted prompts. We evaluate four open-weight instruction-tuned models on 50 prompts per condition, enabling separation of language encoding effects from cultural adaptation effects. Across all models, sycophancy rates are consistently higher for culturally adapted Hindi prompts than for English, with absolute differences ranging from 12.0 to 16.0 percentage points. A decomposition on Qwen 2.5-Coder-7B shows that cultural adaptation (delta = 14.0%, 95% CI: [4.0%, 26.0%]) accounts for the majority of this gap, while language encoding contributes minimally (delta = 2.0%, 95% CI: [0.0%, 6.0%]). Category-level analysis reveals that advice prompts exhibit the largest cross-lingual differences (20-25 percentage points), achieving statistical significance in two of four models.

The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies of varying complexity. Results show that F2NARX outperforms state-of-the-art NARX model by orders of magnitude in efficiency while achieving higher accuracy in general.

We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents in large-scale tournaments across three realistic deployment settings, revealing their strengths and limitations in reasoning about information credibility and the explicit behavior that shapes these interactions. Finally, we propose Tournament Oracle Policy Distillation (TOPD), an offline method that distills tournament oracle policy from interaction logs and deploys it in-context at inference time. Our results show that TOPD significantly improves receiver robustness to persuasion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MixTalk\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u505a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTOPD\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u6297\u8bf4\u670d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u901a\u4fe1\u6709\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MixTalk\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u62df\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTOPD\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0cTOPD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u6297\u8bf4\u670d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TOPD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6218\u7565\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Conventional manual approaches, although methodologically systematic, are resource-intensive and susceptible to subjectivity, whereas heuristic and automated techniques frequently under-perform in recall unless supplemented by extensive expert input. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chained prompt engineering framework for the automated development of search strategies in systematic reviews. The framework replicates the procedural structure of manual search design while leveraging LLMs to decompose review objectives, extract and formalize PICO elements, generate conceptual representations, expand terminologies, and synthesize Boolean queries. In addition to query construction, the framework exhibits superior performance in generating well-structured PICO elements relative to existing methods, thereby strengthening the foundation for high-recall search strategies. Evaluation on a subset of the LEADSInstruct dataset demonstrates that the framework attains a 0.9 average recall. These results significantly exceed the performance of existing approaches. Error analysis further highlights the critical role of precise objective specification and terminological alignment in optimizing retrieval effectiveness. These findings confirm the capacity of LLM-based pipelines to yield transparent, reproducible, and high-performing search strategies, and highlight their potential as scalable instruments for supporting evidence synthesis and evidence-based practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u4e14\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u8bc4\u4ef7\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316PICO\u5143\u7d20\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210PICO\u5143\u7d20\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe0.9\uff0c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u8bc1\u636e\u7efc\u5408\u548c\u5faa\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption.

In recent years, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for the automatic generation of program specifications has emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing verification efficiency. However, existing research has been predominantly confined to generating specifications based on basic syntactic constructs, falling short of meeting the demands for high-level abstraction in complex program verification. Consequently, we propose incorporating logical constructs into existing LLM-based specification generation framework. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of systematic investigation into whether LLMs can effectively generate such complex constructs. To this end, we conduct an empirical study aimed at exploring the impact of various types of syntactic constructs on specification generation framework. Specifically, we define four syntactic configurations with varying levels of abstraction and perform extensive evaluations on mainstream program verification datasets, employing a diverse set of representative LLMs. Experimental results first confirm that LLMs are capable of generating valid logical constructs. Further analysis reveals that the synergistic use of logical constructs and basic syntactic constructs leads to improvements in both verification capability and robustness, without significantly increasing verification overhead. Additionally, we uncover the distinct advantages of two refinement paradigms.

However, ML models trained on sensitive data face security challenges, as they can be attacked and leak information. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) addresses this by using Differential Privacy (DP) to balance utility and privacy. This study identifies image dataset characteristics that affect the utility and vulnerability of private and non-private Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Through analyzing multiple datasets and privacy budgets, we find that imbalanced datasets increase vulnerability in minority classes, but DP mitigates this issue. Datasets with fewer classes improve both model utility and privacy, while high entropy or low Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) datasets deteriorate the utility-privacy trade-off.

To address this issue, we propose a joint client-specific pruning and bandwidth allocation (JCPBA) framework for federated LLMs to improve the fine-tuning efficiency over the wireless networks.

Despite recent advances in LLMs demonstrating their ability to engage in natural conversations with users, we show that even leading models surprisingly struggle to predict a human speaker's next utterance. Instead, humans can readily anticipate forthcoming utterances based on multimodal cues, such as gestures, gaze, and emotional tone, from the context. To systematically examine whether LLMs can reproduce this ability, we propose SayNext-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on anticipating context-conditioned responses from multimodal cues spanning a variety of real-world scenarios. To support this benchmark, we build SayNext-PC, a novel large-scale dataset containing dialogues with rich multimodal cues. Building on this, we further develop a dual-route prediction MLLM, SayNext-Chat, that incorporates cognitively inspired design to emulate predictive processing in conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in terms of lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and emotion consistency. Our results prove the feasibility of next-utterance prediction with LLMs from multimodal cues and emphasize the (i) indispensable role of multimodal cues and (ii) actively predictive processing as the foundation of natural human interaction, which is missing in current MLLMs. We hope that this exploration offers a new research entry toward more human-like, context-sensitive AI interaction for human-centered AI.

However, the high computational and energy overhead of on-device training hinders its deployment on battery-powered mobile systems with strict thermal and memory budgets. While prior research has extensively optimized model architectures for efficient inference, the training phase remains bottlenecked by the processing of massive, often redundant, local datasets. In this work, we propose a data-centric optimization framework that leverages dataset pruning to achieve resource-efficient edge learning. Unlike standard methods that process all available data, our approach constructs compact, highly informative training subsets via a lightweight, on-device importance evaluation. Specifically, we utilize average loss statistics derived from a truncated warm-up phase to rank sample importance, deterministically retaining only the most critical data points under a dynamic pruning ratio.

Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves a near-linear reduction in training latency and energy consumption proportional to the pruning ratio, with negligible degradation in model accuracy.

A random order of individuals is first drawn, and each individual, following this order, selects their most preferred available object. The procedure continues until either all objects have been assigned or all individuals have received an object.\n  RSD is widely recognized for its application in fair allocation problems involving indivisible goods, such as school placements and housing assignments. Despite its extensive use, a comprehensive axiomatic characterization has remained incomplete. For the balanced case $n=m=3$, Bogomolnaia and Moulin have shown that RSD is uniquely characterized by Ex-Post Efficiency, Equal Treatment of Equals, and Strategy-Proofness. The possibility of extending this characterization to larger markets had been a long-standing open question, which Basteck and Ehlers recently answered in the negative for all markets with $n,m\\geq5$.\n  This work completes the picture by identifying exactly for which pairs $\\left(n,m\\right)$ these three axioms uniquely characterize the RSD mechanism and for which pairs they admit multiple mechanisms. In the latter cases, we construct explicit alternatives satisfying the axioms and examine whether augmenting the set of axioms could rule out these alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While these approaches focus on adjusting strategies over time, the structural benefits that static strategy diversity may bring remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we study the impact of individual-level strategy diversity on DE's search dynamics and performance, and introduce iStratDE (DE with individual-level strategies), a minimalist variant that assigns mutation and crossover strategies independently to each individual at initialization and keeps them fixed throughout the evolutionary process. By injecting diversity at the individual level without adaptation or feedback, iStratDE cultivates persistent behavioral heterogeneity that is especially effective with large populations. Moreover, its communication-free construction possesses intrinsic concurrency, thereby enabling efficient parallel execution and straightforward scaling for GPU computing. We further provide a convergence analysis of iStratDE under standard reachability assumptions, which establishes the almost-sure convergence of the best-so-far fitness.

Existing textual code compression methods mitigate this via selective filtering but often disrupt dependency closure, causing semantic fragmentation. To address this, we introduce LongCodeOCR, a visual compression framework that renders code into compressed two-dimensional image sequences for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By preserving a global view, this approach avoids the dependency breakage inherent in filtering. We systematically evaluate LongCodeOCR against the state-of-the-art LongCodeZip across four benchmarks spanning code summarization, code question answering, and code completion.\n  Our results demonstrate that visual code compression serves as a viable alternative for tasks requiring global understanding. At comparable compression ratios ($\\sim$1.7$\\times$), LongCodeOCR improves CompScore on Long Module Summarization by 36.85 points over LongCodeZip. At a 1M-token context length with Glyph (a specialized 9B VLM), LongCodeOCR maintains higher accuracy than LongCodeZip while operating at about 4$\\times$ higher compression. Moreover, compared with LongCodeZip, LongCodeOCR drastically reduces compression-stage overhead (reducing latency from $\\sim$4.3 hours to $\\sim$1 minute at 1M tokens).

Drawing on a large-scale experimental design (n = 3514) comparing human versus AI-mediated communication, we examine effects on consumers' social preferences (fairness, trust, reciprocity, efficiency) and social emotions (stigma, empathy). Participants perceive human interactions as more fair and more likely to elicit reciprocity, while AI-mediated communication is viewed as more efficient; no differences emerge in trust. Human contact elicits greater empathy, but also stronger feelings of stigma. Exploratory analyses reveal notable variation between gender, age groups, and cultural contexts. In general, the findings suggest that AI-mediated communication can improve efficiency and reduce stigma without diminishing trust, but should be used carefully in situations that require high empathy or increased sensitivity to fairness.

Because it is prohibitively expensive for most organizations to build and maintain a large GPU cluster, organizations instead choose to rent GPUs from cloud providers. The customer is responsible for devising a policy for (i) deciding how many GPUs to rent at every moment in time to process a stream of ML training jobs and (ii) allocating the rented GPUs among the currently active jobs in the system. Because ML training jobs can be parallelized across different numbers of GPUs, the customer generally has many options for how many GPUs to use for each job. Allocating more GPUs to a single training job will cause the job to complete more quickly. However, the customer pays for each GPU-hour they use, and a training job receives a diminishing marginal benefit from running on additional GPUs. Hence, allocating too many GPUs to a single training job can dramatically increase the overall cost that the customer pays to the cloud provider. This gives rise to a cost-performance tradeoff that customers must balance when running training jobs in the cloud.\n  To balance the cost-performance tradeoff, we develop BOA Constrictor, a new scheduler for ML training jobs which uses a Budget-Optimal Allocation (BOA) policy to squeeze the highest level of performance out of a cloud-deployed GPU cluster given a fixed budget constraint. We explicitly formulate the problem as a budget-constrained scheduling problem and derive the BOA policy which minimizes the average job completion time (JCT) of a stream of arriving jobs subject to the user's budget. For a given budget level, we demonstrate that BOA Constrictor can reduce average JCT by 1.6 times in small-scale implementation experiments and by 2 times in detailed, large-scale simulations compared to state-of-the-art heuristic based schedulers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74GPU\u8bad\u7ec3ML\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u4ece\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u79dfGPU\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c - \u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1BOA Constrictor\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ec4\u7ec7\u81ea\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ece\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u79dfGPU\u65f6\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u672c - \u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4f7f\u7528Budget - Optimal Allocation (BOA) \u7b56\u7565\u7684BOA Constrictor\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u660e\u786e\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfcBOA\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0cBOA Constrictor\u53ef\u4f7f\u5e73\u5747\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e1.6\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e2\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "BOA Constrictor\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u80fd\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The final version will appear in IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in mental health support systems, where reliable recognition of high-risk states such as suicidal ideation and self-harm is safety-critical. However, existing evaluations primarily rely on aggregate performance metrics, which often obscure risk-specific failure modes and provide limited insight into model behavior in realistic, multi-turn interactions. We present MHDash, an open-source platform designed to support the development, evaluation, and auditing of AI systems for mental health applications. MHDash integrates data collection, structured annotation, multi-turn dialogue generation, and baseline evaluation into a unified pipeline. The platform supports annotations across multiple dimensions, including Concern Type, Risk Level, and Dialogue Intent, enabling fine-grained and risk-aware analysis. Our results reveal several key findings: (i) simple baselines and advanced LLM APIs exhibit comparable overall accuracy yet diverge significantly on high-risk cases; (ii) some LLMs maintain consistent ordinal severity ranking while failing absolute risk classification, whereas others achieve reasonable aggregate scores but suffer from high false negative rates on severe categories; and (iii) performance gaps are amplified in multi-turn dialogues, where risk signals emerge gradually. These observations demonstrate that conventional benchmarks are insufficient for safety-critical mental health settings.

We formalise the setting of action-free offline-to-online RL, where agents must learn from datasets consisting solely of $(s,r,s')$ tuples and later leverage this knowledge during online interaction. To address this challenge, we propose learning state policies that recommend desirable next-state transitions rather than actions. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a simple yet novel state discretisation transformation and propose Offline State-Only DecQN (\\algo), a value-based algorithm designed to pre-train state policies from action-free data. \\algo{} integrates the transformation to scale efficiently to high-dimensional problems while avoiding instability and overfitting associated with continuous state prediction. Second, we propose a novel mechanism for guided online learning that leverages these pre-trained state policies to accelerate the learning of online agents. Together, these components establish a scalable and practical framework for leveraging action-free datasets to accelerate online RL.

Conventional time-based maintenance schedules frequently engender superfluous expenditures and unanticipated equipment failures.

The present paper proposes a novel distributional reinforcement learning approach for multi-equipment CBM using Quantile Regression Deep Q-Networks (QR-DQN) with aging factor integration. The methodology employed in this study encompasses the concurrent administration of multiple pump units through three strategic scenarios. The implementation of safety-first, balanced, and cost-efficient approaches is imperative. Comprehensive experimental validation over 3,000 training episodes demonstrates significant performance improvements across all strategies. The Safety-First strategy demonstrates superior cost efficiency, with a return on investment (ROI) of 3.91, yielding 152\\% better performance than alternatives while requiring only 31\\% higher investment.

We study a null validated topological approach for quantifying market complexity and apply it to Bitcoin daily log returns. The analysis uses the $L^1$ norm of persistence landscapes computed from sliding-window delay embeddings. This quantity shows strong co-movement with stochastic volatility during periods of market stress, but remains intermittently elevated during low volatility regimes, indicating dynamical structure beyond fluctuation scale. Rolling correlation analysis reveals that the dependence between geometry and volatility is not stationary. Surrogate based null models provide statistical validation of these observations.

Scratch programs exhibit deeply nested, non-linear structures, event-driven concurrency across multiple sprites, and tight coupling between code and multimedia assets, properties that differ fundamentally from textual code. As a result, LLMs often misinterpret Scratch semantics and generate large, invasive edits that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect when repairing buggy programs.\n  We introduce ScratchEval, the first executable benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair for Scratch programs, covering program understanding, debugging, analysis, and repair. The benchmark contains 100 curated Scratch projects from the public repository, selected for structural and semantic complexity. Each project is paired with executable test suites, bug descriptions with corresponding fixes, block-level edit constraints defining minimal semantically correct repairs, and required multimedia assets. The benchmark is constructed through a human-in-the-loop pipeline combining automated project mining with expert validation of trigger-outcome semantics and representative bug patterns, with emphasis on event ordering, concurrency, and state management.\n  To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we propose a three-layer executable protocol measuring functional correctness via VM-level execution, repair quality using block-level edit distance and behavioral trajectory comparisons, and explanation quality via structured rubrics assessing alignment between model reasoning and generated patches.

Code available at https://github.com/medbeads/medbeads", "summary": "Background: As of 2026, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge. However, deploying them as autonomous \"Clinical Agents\" remains limited. Current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and standards like FHIR are designed for human review, creating a \"Context Mismatch\": AI agents receive fragmented data and must rely on probabilistic inference (e.g., RAG) to reconstruct patient history. This approach causes hallucinations and hinders auditability. Methods: We propose MedBeads, an agent-native data infrastructure where clinical events are immutable \"Beads\"--nodes in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)--cryptographically referencing causal predecessors. This \"write-once, read-many\" architecture makes tampering mathematically detectable. We implemented a prototype with a Go Core Engine, Python middleware for LLM integration, and a React-based visualization interface. Results: We successfully implemented the workflow using synthetic data. The FHIR-to-DAG conversion transformed flat resources into a causally-linked graph. Our Breadth-First Search (BFS) Context Retrieval algorithm traverses relevant subgraphs with O(V+E) complexity, enabling real-time decision support. Tamper-evidence is guaranteed by design: any modification breaks the cryptographic chain. The visualization aids clinician understanding through explicit causal links. Conclusion: MedBeads addresses the \"Context Mismatch\" by shifting from probabilistic search to deterministic graph traversal, and from mutable records to immutable chains, providing the substrate for \"Trustworthy Medical AI.\" It guarantees the context the AI receives is deterministic and tamper-evident, while the LLM determines interpretation.

A malleable job can be parallelized across any number of cores, yet the job typically exhibits diminishing marginal returns for each additional core on which it runs. This can be seen in the concavity of a job's speedup function, which describes the job's processing speed as a function of the number of cores on which it runs.\n  Given the prevalence of malleable jobs, several theoretical works have posed the problem of how to allocate a fixed number of cores across a stream of arriving malleable jobs so as to minimize the mean response time across jobs. We refer to this as the Core Allocation to Malleable jobs (CAM) problem. We solve the CAM problem under a highly general setting, allowing for multiple job classes, each with an arbitrary concave speedup function and holding costs (weight). Furthermore, we allow for generally distributed inter-arrival times and job sizes.\n  We analyze the CAM problem in the mean field asymptotic regime and derive two distinct mean field optimal policies, FW-CAM and WHAM. FW-CAM is interesting because it demonstrates a new intuition: in the mean field regime, job sizes are not relevant in finding an optimal policy. WHAM (Whittle Allocation for Malleable jobs) is interesting because it is asymptotically optimal and also serves as a good heuristic even outside of the asymptotic regime.

Scaling training-time and inference-time compute improves static capability but does not close this train-deploy gap. We argue that addressing this limitation requires a new scaling axis-evolution. Existing deployment-time adaptation methods, whether parametric fine-tuning or heuristic memory accumulation, lack the strategic agency needed to diagnose failures and produce durable improvements. Our position is that agentic evolution represents the inevitable future of LLM adaptation, elevating evolution itself from a fixed pipeline to an autonomous evolver agent. We instantiate this vision in a general framework, A-Evolve, which treats deployment-time improvement as a deliberate, goal-directed optimization process over persistent system state.

However, existing methods predominantly operate as first-order optimizers akin to Stochastic Gradient Descent, which are suffering from slow convergence and instability because they neglect the semantic curvature of the optimization landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextBFGS, a second-order framework to implement a Quasi-Newton optimization method for discrete text. Unlike traditional memory-based approaches that retrieve similar textual instances, TextBFGS approximates the inverse Hessian matrix by retrieving Gradient-Operators from the memory of pre-learned successful trajectories. Specifically, given a textual gradient feedback, TextBFGS identifies historical correction patterns from the optimization knowledge base and tries to apply these abstract operators to the current variable. This mechanism enables a One-Pass Update, combining feedback generation and second-order correction into a single inference step. Empirical evaluations on code optimization across diverse domains (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP) demonstrate that TextBFGS significantly outperforms first-order baselines. It achieves superior pass rates with fewer model calls and exhibits strong cross-task transferability, thus establishes a mathematically grounded paradigm for efficient, memory-aware text optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u9636\u6846\u67b6TextBFGS\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u4e49\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTextBFGS\u4e8c\u9636\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9884\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9006Hessian\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982HumanEval\u3001MBPP\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cTextBFGS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TextBFGS\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Using the Hurst exponent $h(2)$ and multifractal strength, we assess how market dynamics responded to two major global shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the Trump tariff policy in 2025. The results show that COVID-19 induced substantial changes in both the Hurst exponent and multifractal strength, particularly for the S\\&P 500, BTC/USD, EUR/USD, and Gold. In contrast, the effects of the Trump tariffs were more moderate but still observable across all examined time series. The Chinese market index (SSEC) remained largely unaffected by either event, apart from a distinct response to domestic stimulus measures. In addition, the VIX exhibited anti-persistent behavior with $h(2) < 0.5$, consistent with the rough volatility framework.

Engaging in collaboration can improve the service operations (e.g., reduced delay) of these data owners, however, it can also raise privacy concerns and discourage data-sharing willingness. Specifically, data owners may be concerned that the shared data may leak sensitive information about their customers' mobility patterns or business secrets, resulting in the failure of collaboration. This paper investigates how privacy-preserving mechanisms can foster data collaboration in such settings. We propose a game-theoretic framework to investigate data-sharing among transportation stakeholders, especially considering perturbation-based privacy-preserving mechanisms. Numerical studies demonstrate that lower data quality expectations can incentivize voluntary data sharing, improving transport-related welfare for both MAs and MPs.

To address these limitations, we propose SPARC-RAG, a multi-agent framework that coordinates sequential and parallel inference-time scaling under a unified context management mechanism. SPARC-RAG employs specialized agents that maintain a shared global context and provide explicit control over the scaling process. It generates targeted, complementary sub-queries for each branch to enable diverse parallel exploration, and explicitly regulates exiting decisions based on answer correctness and evidence grounding. To optimize scaling behavior, we further introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method with process-level verifiable preferences, which improves the efficiency of sequential scaling and effectiveness of parallel scaling.

Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9SNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u9898\u63d0\u51faSpikingGamma\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u7ec6\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dSNN\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u9012\u5f52\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408sigma - delta\u8109\u51b2\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5f62\u6210SpikingGamma\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u7ec6\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u524d\u9988SNN\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9012\u5f52SNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5c06SNN\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Detecting Tests Obsessed by Methods", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": "Accepted for publication at ICPC 2026", "summary": "Best testing practices state that tests should verify a single functionality or behavior of the system. Tests that verify multiple behaviors are harder to understand, lack focus, and are more coupled to the production code. An attempt to identify this issue is the test smell \\emph{Eager Test}, which aims to capture tests that verify too much functionality based on the number of production method calls. Unfortunately, prior research suggests that counting production method calls is an inaccurate measure, as these calls do not reliably serve as a proxy for functionality. We envision a complementary solution based on runtime analysis: we hypothesize that some tests that verify multiple behaviors will likely cover multiple paths of the same production methods. Thus, we propose a novel test smell named \\emph{Test Obsessed by Method}, a test method that covers multiple paths of a single production method. We provide an initial empirical study to explore the presence of this smell in 2,054 tests provided by 12 test suites of the Python Standard Library. (1) We detect 44 \\emph{Tests Obsessed by Methods} in 11 of the 12 test suites. (2) Each smelly test verifies a median of two behaviors of the production method. (3) The 44 smelly tests could be split into 118 novel tests. (4) 23% of the smelly tests have code comments recognizing that distinct behaviors are being tested.

While such representations are intuitive for privacy, they pose challenges for machine learning, which typically treats non-original values as new categories or as missing, thereby discarding generalization semantics. For learning from such tabular data, we propose novel data transformation strategies that account for heterogeneous anonymization and evaluate them alongside standard imputation and LLM-based approaches. We employ multiple datasets, privacy configurations, and deployment scenarios, demonstrating that our method reliably regains utility. Our results show that generalized values are preferable to pure suppression, that the best data preparation strategy depends on the scenario, and that consistent data representations are crucial for maintaining downstream utility.

Yet, most existing methods treat workload scheduling and regulation capacity bidding separately, overlooking how queueing dynamics and spatial-temporal dispatch decisions affect the ability to sustain real-time regulation. As a result, the committed regulation may become infeasible or short-lived. To address this issue, we propose a unified day-ahead co-optimization framework that jointly decides workload distribution across geographically distributed DCs and regulation capacity commitments. We construct a space-time network model to capture workload migration costs, latency requirements, and heterogeneous resource limits. To ensure that the committed regulation remains deliverable, we introduce chance constraints on instantaneous power flexibility based on interactive load forecasts, and apply Value-at-Risk queue-state constraints to maintain sustainable response under cumulative regulation signals. Case studies on a modified IEEE 68-bus system using real data center traces show that the proposed framework lowers system operating costs, enables more viable regulation capacity, and achieves better revenue-risk trade-offs compared to strategies that optimize scheduling and regulation independently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65e5\u524d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u5bb9\u91cf\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u589e\u52a0\u8c03\u8282\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u76ca\u98ce\u9669\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u5bb9\u91cf\u6295\u6807\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6392\u961f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u627f\u8bfa\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6216\u77ed\u6682\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u529f\u7387\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u4ef7\u503c\u961f\u5217\u72b6\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7684IEEE 68\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u8c03\u8282\u5bb9\u91cf\u66f4\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6536\u76ca - \u98ce\u9669\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage.

The standard end-to-end backpropagation (BP) algorithm is a primary driver of modern AI, but it is also the source of inefficiency in training deep networks. This paper introduces a new training methodology, Supervised Contrastive Parallel Learning (SCPL), that addresses this issue by decoupling BP and transforming a long gradient flow into multiple short ones. This design enables the simultaneous computation of parameter gradients in different layers, achieving superior model parallelism and enhancing training throughput. Detailed experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model compared to BP, Early Exit, GPipe, and Associated Learning (AL), a state-of-the-art method for decoupling backpropagation. By mitigating a fundamental performance bottleneck, SCPL provides a practical pathway for organizations to develop and deploy advanced information systems more cost-effectively and with greater agility.

Despite extensive efforts exploring diverse retrieval strategies, existing studies predominantly focus on query-side complexity or isolated method improvements, lacking a systematic understanding of how RAG paradigms behave across different query-corpus contexts and effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce RAGRouter-Bench, the first dataset and benchmark designed for adaptive RAG routing. RAGRouter-Bench revisits retrieval from a query-corpus compatibility perspective and standardizes five representative RAG paradigms for systematic evaluation across 7,727 queries and 21,460 documents spanning diverse domains. The benchmark incorporates three canonical query types together with fine-grained semantic and structural corpus metrics, as well as a unified evaluation for both generation quality and resource consumption. Experiments with DeepSeek-V3 and LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that no single RAG paradigm is universally optimal, that paradigm applicability is strongly shaped by query-corpus interactions, and that increased advanced mechanism does not necessarily yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. These findings underscore the necessity of routing-aware evaluation and establish a foundation for adaptive, interpretable, and generalizable next-generation RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RAG\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6RAGRouter - Bench\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cRAG\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8def\u7531\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2 - \u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ca\u6709\u6548\u6027 - \u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RAGRouter - Bench\uff0c\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2 - \u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e94\u79cdRAG\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u5355\u4e00RAG\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u8303\u5f0f\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u67e5\u8be2 - \u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u8def\u7531\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Yet, it suffers from significant memory and thread-safety issues. Recent studies have explored automated translation of C/C++ to safer languages, such as Rust. However, these studies focused mostly on the correctness and safety of the translated code, which are indeed critical, but they left other important quality concerns (e.g., performance, robustness, and maintainability) largely unexplored. This work investigates strengths and weaknesses of three C-to-Rust translators, namely C2Rust (a transpiler), C2SaferRust (an LLM-guided transpiler), and TranslationGym (an LLM-based direct translation). We perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of several important quality attributes for the translated Rust code of the popular GNU coreutils, using human-based translation as a baseline. To assess the internal and external quality of the Rust code, we: (i) apply Clippy, a rule-based state-of-the-practice Rust static analysis tool; (ii) investigate the capability of an LLM (GPT-4o) to identify issues potentially overlooked by Clippy; and (iii) perform a manual analysis of the issues reported by Clippy and GPT-4o. Our results show that while newer techniques reduce some unsafe and non-idiomatic patterns, they frequently introduce new issues, revealing systematic trade-offs that are not visible under existing evaluation practices. Notably, none of the automated techniques consistently match or exceed human-written translations across all quality dimensions, yet even human-written Rust code exhibits persistent internal quality issues such as readability and non-idiomatic patterns. Together, these findings show that translation quality remains a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring systematic evaluation and targeted tool support beyond both naive automation and manual rewriting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cdC\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u8d85\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u4ecd\u662f\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709C/C++\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5065\u58ee\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d41\u884cGNU coreutils\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528Clippy\u3001GPT-4o\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u975e\u60ef\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u96be\u8d85\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e5f\u6709\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u91cd\u5199\u3002"}}

For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f20\u8f93\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6846\u67b6FluxNet\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684PDE\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\u65f6\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u6eda\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u8fdd\u53cd\u5168\u5c40\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8fb9\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u56de\u5f52\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65bd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u683c\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u901f\u5ea6\u4f20\u8f93\u8868\u793a\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u4f20\u8f93\u7b97\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u6362\u66f4\u65b0\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u79bb\u6563\u5b88\u6052\uff1b\u5bf9\u6709\u754c\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u884c\u96c6\u5185\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u57281D\u5bf9\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u30012D\u6d45\u6c34\u65b9\u7a0b\u30011D\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u548c2D\u65cb\u8282\u5206\u89e3\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6d45\u6c34\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u6eda\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u573a\u65cb\u8282\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8PDE\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware.

However, reasoning-oriented RL post-training remains fundamentally challenging due to sparse trajectory-level rewards, leading to ambiguous credit assignment and severe exploration failures that can trap the policy in a ``learning cliff.'' Recent on-policy distillation methods introduce dense teacher supervision to stabilize optimization, but apply it uniformly across all generated trajectories. We argue that such uniform distillation is ill-suited for reasoning-intensive tasks, as low-quality on-policy trajectories often originate from early logical errors, and distillation under flawed contexts injects noisy and misaligned gradients. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge-Enhanced Preference Optimization (KEPO), a unified post-training framework that integrates: (i) a quality-gated on-policy distillation objective that selectively applies dense teacher guidance only to high-quality trajectories, and (ii) a knowledge-enhanced exploration strategy that leverages hints learned from a teacher model to rejectively sample reward-positive on-policy trajectories for RL, thereby mitigating exploration collapse.

In this work, we investigate the robustness of common combinations of machine learning models and counterfactual generation algorithms in the presence of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tabular datasets, we show that counterfactual explanations are highly sensitive to model uncertainty.

Information propagates through the network and reaches from one person to the next. In many settings, it is meaningful to restrict diffusion so that each node can spread information to only a limited number of its neighbors rather than to all of them. Such social networks are called closed social networks. In recent years, social media platforms have emerged as an effective medium for commercial entities, where the objective is to maximize profit. In this paper, we study the Profit Maximization in Closed Social Networks (PMCSN) problem in the context of viral marketing. The input to the problem is a closed social network and two positive integers $\\ell$ and $B$. The problem asks to select seed nodes within a given budget $B$; during the diffusion process, each node is restricted to choose at most $\\ell$ outgoing links for information diffusion; and the objective is to maximize the profit earned by the seed set. The PMCSN problem generalizes the Influence Maximization problem, which is NP-hard. We propose two solution approaches for PMCSN: a sampling-based approximate solution and a marginal-gain-based heuristic solution.

While recent research has begun to address fairness in ranking, most existing approaches adopt an equality-based perspective, aiming to ensure that providers with similar content receive similar exposure. However, it overlooks the diverse needs of real-world providers, whose utility from ranking may depend not only on exposure but also on outcomes like sales or engagement. Consequently, exposure-based fairness may not accurately capture the true utility perceived by different providers with varying priorities. To this end, we introduce an equity-oriented fairness framework that explicitly models each provider's preferences over key outcomes such as exposure and sales, thus evaluating whether a ranking algorithm can fulfill these individualized goals while maintaining overall fairness across providers. Based on this framework, we develop EquityRank, a gradient-based algorithm that jointly optimizes user-side effectiveness and provider-side equity. Extensive offline and online simulations demonstrate that EquityRank offers improved trade-offs between effectiveness and fairness and adapts to heterogeneous provider needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1EquityRank\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6392\u540d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u7b49\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9762\u5411\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684EquityRank\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0cEquityRank\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "EquityRank\u80fd\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7aef\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Evaluation results on frontier models reveal that top models achieve pass rates exceeding 50%, with primary failures arising from inadequate tool usage and task understanding.

However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages.

Existing graph contrastive learning methods typically rely on either random perturbations (e.g., edge dropping) to generate diverse views or purely spectral augmentations (e.g., SVD) to preserve global structural priors. However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often become dense and lack sufficient diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGCL, a robust graph contrastive learning framework via SVD-guided structural perturbation. SPGCL couples lightweight stochastic edge removal with an SVD-guided refinement step that can recover mistakenly removed informative edges and introduce semantically meaningful missing links while avoiding graph densification through sparse top-ranked edge selection and merging. By balancing edge removal and recovery rates, SPGCL explicitly controls structural discrepancy between views so that contrastive signals reflect semantic structural differences rather than edge-count gaps. We further incorporate a contrastive fusion module regularized by a global similarity constraint to better align the two views.

In this work, we critically examine this trend and argue that Long CoT is inherently ill-suited for the sequential recommendation domain. We attribute this misalignment to two primary factors: excessive inference latency and the lack of explicit cognitive reasoning patterns in user behavioral data. Driven by these observations, we propose pivoting away from the CoT structure to directly leverage its underlying mechanism: Reinforcement Learning (RL), to explore the item space. However, applying RL directly faces significant obstacles, notably low sample efficiency-where most actions fail to provide learning signals-and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose RISER, a novel Reinforced Item Space Exploration framework for Recommendation. RISER is designed to transform non-learnable trajectories into effective pairwise preference data for optimization.

A key mechanism employed in any GOMEA variant is the exploitation of linkage, the dependencies between variables, to ensure efficient evolution. In GP-GOMEA, mutual information between node positions in GP trees has so far been used to learn linkage. For this, a fixed expression template is used. This however leads to introns for expressions smaller than the full template. As introns have no impact on fitness, their occurrences are not directly linked to selection. Consequently, introns can adversely affect the extent to which mutual information captures dependencies between tree nodes. To overcome this, we propose two new measures for linkage learning, one that explicitly considers introns in mutual information estimates, and one that revisits linkage learning in GP-GOMEA from a grey-box perspective, yielding a measure that needs not to be learned from the population but is derived directly from the template. Across five standard symbolic regression problems, GP-GOMEA achieves substantial improvements using both measures. We also find that the newly learned linkage structure closely reflects the template linkage structure, and that explicitly using the template structure yields the best performance overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u5b66\u4e60\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbGP - GOMEA\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GP - GOMEA\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6a21\u677f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u9501\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5185\u542b\u5b50\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6811\u8282\u70b9\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6355\u6349", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u5b66\u4e60\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u5185\u542b\u5b50\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u7070\u76d2\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fde\u9501\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u4f7fGP - GOMEA\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6a21\u677f\u8fde\u9501\u7ed3\u6784\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u677f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73"}}

Traditional testing methods, limited by extensive manual effort and oversimplified test environments, fail to capture production system complexity. To address these limitations, we present Cast, an automated, end-to-end framework for microservice resilience testing in production. It achieves high test fidelity by replaying production traffic against a comprehensive library of application-level faults to exercise internal error-handling logic. To manage the combinatorial test space, Cast employs a complexity-driven strategy to systematically prune redundant tests and prioritize high-value tests targeting the most critical service execution paths. Cast automates the testing lifecycle through a three-phase pipeline (i.e., startup, fault injection, and recovery) and uses a multi-faceted oracle to automatically verify system resilience against nuanced criteria. Deployed in Huawei Cloud for over eight months, Cast has been adopted by many service teams to proactively address resilience vulnerabilities. Our analysis on four large-scale applications with millions of traces reveals 137 potential vulnerabilities, with 89 confirmed by developers. To further quantify its performance, Cast is evaluated on a benchmark set of 48 reproduced bugs, achieving a high coverage of 90%.

A fundamental limitation of current architectures is the epistemic asymmetry inherent in probabilistic vision-language models and dense associative memories: they conflate semantic affinity with factual existence and structurally fail to encode negative constraints. To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state.

We show that this behaviour is not incidental, but arises from a fundamental geometric mechanism in input space. Using kernel ridge regression as an exact model of wide neural networks, we prove that clustered dirty label poisons induce a rank one spike in the input Hessian whose magnitude scales quadratically with attack efficacy. Crucially, for nonlinear kernels we identify a near clone regime in which poison efficacy remains order one while the induced input curvature vanishes, making the attack provably spectrally undetectable. We further show that input gradient regularisation contracts poison aligned Fisher and Hessian eigenmodes under gradient flow, yielding an explicit and unavoidable safety efficacy trade off by reducing data fitting capacity. For exponential kernels, this defence admits a precise interpretation as an anisotropic high pass filter that increases the effective length scale and suppresses near clone poisons. Extensive experiments on linear models and deep convolutional networks across MNIST and CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 validate the theory, demonstrating consistent lags between attack success and spectral visibility, and showing that regularisation and data augmentation jointly suppress poisoning.

To address this issue, we propose NSG (Node Splitting Graph)-MoE, a multimodal graph learning framework that integrates a node-splitting and graph-rewiring mechanism with a structured Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. It explicitly decomposes each node into modality-specific components and assigns relation-aware experts to process heterogeneous message flows, thereby preserving structural information and multimodal semantics while mitigating the undesirable mixing effects commonly observed in general-purpose GNNs. Extensive experiments on three multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that NSG-MoE consistently surpasses strong baselines. Despite incorporating MoE -- which is typically computationally heavy -- our method achieves competitive training efficiency. Beyond empirical results, we provide a spectral analysis revealing that NSG performs adaptive filtering over modality-specific subspaces, thus explaining its disentangling behavior.

The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\\exp(O(d\\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $\u03a9(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument.

Concurrently, with the rise of large models (LMs), multimodal recommendation is increasingly leveraging their strengths in semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. However, LM representations are inherently optimized for general semantic tasks, while recommendation models rely heavily on sparse user/item unique identity (ID) features. Existing works overlook the fundamental representational divergence between large models and recommendation systems, resulting in incompatible multimodal representations and suboptimal recommendation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose RecGOAT, a novel yet simple dual semantic alignment framework for LLM-enhanced multimodal recommendation, which offers theoretically guaranteed alignment capability. RecGOAT first employs graph attention networks to enrich collaborative semantics by modeling item-item, user-item, and user-user relationships, leveraging user/item LM representations and interaction history. Furthermore, we design a dual-granularity progressive multimodality-ID alignment framework, which achieves instance-level and distribution-level semantic alignment via cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL) and optimal adaptive transport (OAT), respectively. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the unified representations derived from our alignment framework exhibit superior semantic consistency and comprehensiveness.

Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency.

Despite this complexity, our analysis of over 500,000 production traces from ByteDance reveals a latent regularity: execution paths concentrate around a small set of recurring invocation patterns. However, existing resource management approaches fail to exploit this structure. Industrial autoscalers like Kubernetes HPA ignore inter-service dependencies, while recent academic methods often assume static topologies, rendering them ineffective under dynamic execution contexts. In this work, we propose Morphis, a dependency-aware provisioning framework that unifies pattern-aware trace analysis with global optimization. It introduces structural fingerprinting that decomposes traces into a stable execution backbone and interpretable deviation subgraphs. Then, resource allocation is formulated as a constrained optimization problem over predicted pattern distributions, jointly minimizing aggregate CPU usage while satisfying end-to-end tail-latency SLOs.

We study CODI, a continuous-thought teacher-student distillation model, on strictly sequential polynomial-iteration tasks. Using logit-lens decoding, linear probes, attention analysis, and activation patching, we localize intermediate-state representations and trace their routing to the final readout. On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization.

This presents a major challenge, as high-fidelity (HF) data is often scarce and computationally expensive to acquire, while low-fidelity (LF) data is abundant but less accurate. To address this data scarcity problem, we develop a probabilistic multi-fidelity surrogate framework based on generative transfer learning. We employ a normalizing flow (NF) generative model as the backbone, which is trained in two phases: (i) the NF is first pretrained on a large LF dataset to learn a probabilistic forward model; (ii) the pretrained model is then fine-tuned on a small HF dataset, allowing it to correct for LF-HF discrepancies via knowledge transfer. To relax the dimension-preserving constraint of standard bijective NFs, we integrate surjective (dimension-reducing) layers with standard coupling blocks. This architecture enables learned dimension reduction while preserving the ability to train with exact likelihoods. The resulting surrogate provides fast probabilistic predictions with quantified uncertainty and significantly outperforms LF-only baselines while using fewer HF evaluations. We validate the approach on a reinforced concrete slab benchmark, combining many coarse-mesh (LF) simulations with a limited set of fine-mesh (HF) simulations. The proposed model achieves probabilistic predictions with HF accuracy, demonstrating a practical path toward data-efficient, generative AI-driven surrogates for complex engineering systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6982\u7387\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u6ee1\u5c04\u5c42\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8026\u5408\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees.\n  We focus on the polynomial regime ($\u0398(n^{1/k} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \\leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $\u0398(n^r)$.\n  Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees.\n  Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $\u03a0$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $\u03a0$ is either\n  - $\u0398(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$, or\n  - $O(\\log n)$.\n  Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $\u03a0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We further provide a theoretical perspective showing that diversity across agents supports recovery of omitted information: although any single compressed history may discard details, aggregating multiple agents' compressed views allows the collective representation to approach the information bottleneck with exponentially high probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6DebateOCR\uff0c\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u968f\u7740\u8f6e\u6570\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u6587\u672c\u5386\u53f2\u4f1a\u8d85\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u590d\u603b\u7ed3\u5e26\u6765\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DebateOCR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u66ff\u6362\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8fa9\u8bba\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u4e86\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u6570\u4e07\u5230\u6570\u5341\u4e07\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8592%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u652f\u6301\u6062\u590d\u9057\u6f0f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u56fe\u53ef\u4f7f\u96c6\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u6781\u5927\u6982\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

When derivatives cannot be evaluated directly, stochastic estimators can provide approximate gradients. However, these estimators' perturbation-based sampling of the objective function introduces variance that can lead to slow convergence. In this paper, we present dimensional peeking, a variance reduction method for gradient estimation in discrete optimization via simulation. By lifting the sampling granularity from scalar values to classes of values that follow the same control flow path, we increase the information gathered per simulation evaluation. Our derivation from an established smoothed gradient estimator shows that the method does not introduce any bias. We present an implementation via a custom numerical data type to transparently carry out dimensional peeking over C++ programs.

Related is the covering problem (or sub-marking reachbility), which decides whether there is a reachable marking covering at least the tokens in the given marking. For live and bounded free-choice nets as well as for sound free-choice workflow nets, both problems are polynomial in their computational complexity. This paper refines this complexity for the class of sound acyclic free-choice workflow nets to a quadratic polynomial, more specifically to $O(P^2 + T^2)$. Furthermore, this paper shows the feasibility of accurately explaining why a given marking is or is not reachable. This can be achieved by three new concepts: admissibility, maximum admissibility, and diverging transitions. Admissibility requires that all places in a given marking are pairwise concurrent. Maximum admissibility states that adding a marked place to an admissible marking would make it inadmissible. A diverging transition is a transition which originally \"produces\" the concurrent tokens that lead to a given marking. In this paper, we provide algorithms for all these concepts and explain their computation in detail by basing them on the concepts of concurrency and post-dominance frontiers - a well known concept from compiler construction.

However, real-world deployments raise an increasingly important yet underexplored issue: trustworthiness. On modern e-commerce platforms, multimodal content can be misleading or unreliable (e.g., visually inconsistent product images or click-bait titles), injecting untrustworthy signals into multimodal representations and making existing recommenders brittle under modality corruption. In this work, we take a step towards trustworthy multimodal recommendation from both a method and an analysis perspective. First, we propose a plug-and-play modality-level rectification component that mitigates untrustworthy modality features by learning soft correspondences between items and multimodal features. Using lightweight projections and Sinkhorn-based soft matching, the rectification suppresses mismatched modality signals while preserving semantic consistency, and can be integrated into existing multimodal recommenders without architectural modifications. Second, we present two practical insights on interaction-level trustworthiness under noisy collaborative signals: (i) training-set pseudo interactions can help or hurt performance under noise depending on prior-signal alignment; and (ii) propagation-graph pseudo edges can also help or hurt robustness, as message passing may amplify misalignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones under varying corruption levels demonstrate improved robustness from modality rectification and validate the above interaction-level observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u7ea7\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ea7\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f1a\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u635f\u574f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u7ea7\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u54c1\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u63a2\u7a76\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ea7\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ea7\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ea7\u89c1\u89e3\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Stream of Revision, a paradigm shift that elevates code generation from a monotonic stream to a dynamic, self-correcting trajectory by leveraging model's intrinsic capabilities. We introduce specific action tokens that enable the model to seamlessly backtrack and edit its own history within a single forward pass.

In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6HierSignSGD\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5c42\u548c\u4e91\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u53d1\u9001\u7b26\u53f7\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e91\u5b9a\u671f\u5e73\u5747\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u5e7f\u64ad\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "HierSignSGD\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u79ef\u6781\u4e0b\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0HierSignSGD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Comprehensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show DRIO consistently improves imputation under both missing-completely-at-random and missing-not-at-random settings, reaching Pareto-optimal trade-offs between reconstruction accuracy and distributional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRIO\u89e3\u51b3MTS\u63d2\u8865\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "MTS\u63d2\u8865\u5b58\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6709\u504f\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDRIO\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u63d2\u8865\u5668\u4e0eWasserstein\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u5185\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5bf9\u5076\u516c\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDRIO\u5728MCAR\u548cMNAR\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u63d2\u8865\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "DRIO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3MTS\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Instead of proposing a new QD algorithm, this work introduces a novel reformulation by casting the QD optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with a huge number of optimization objectives. By establishing this connection, we enable the direct adoption of well-established MOO methods, particularly set-based scalarization techniques, to solve QD problems through a collaborative search process.

Traditional methods, including manual and information retrieval models, are labor-intensive, error-prone, and limited by low precision. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for supporting software engineering tasks through advanced language comprehension. However, a substantial gap exists in the systematic design and evaluation of prompts tailored to extract accurate trace links. This paper introduces TraceLLM, a systematic framework for enhancing requirements traceability through prompt engineering and demonstration selection. Our approach incorporates rigorous dataset splitting, iterative prompt refinement, enrichment with contextual roles and domain knowledge, and evaluation across zero- and few-shot settings. We assess prompt generalization and robustness using eight state-of-the-art LLMs on four benchmark datasets representing diverse domains (aerospace, healthcare) and artifact types (requirements, design elements, test cases, regulations). TraceLLM achieves state-of-the-art F2 scores, outperforming traditional IR baselines, fine-tuned models, and prior LLM-based methods. We also explore the impact of demonstration selection strategies, identifying label-aware, diversity-based sampling as particularly effective. Overall, our findings highlight that traceability performance depends not only on model capacity but also critically on the quality of prompt engineering.

The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer.\n  Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur.

To this end, we propose L$^{2}$-VMAS, a novel model-agnostic framework that enables inter-agent collaboration with dual latent memories. Furthermore, we decouple the perception and thinking while dynamically synthesizing dual latent memories. Additionally, we introduce an entropy-driven proactive triggering that replaces passive information transmission with efficient, on-demand memory access. Extensive experiments among backbones, sizes, and multi-agent structures demonstrate that our method effectively breaks the \"scaling wall\" with superb scalability, improving average accuracy by 2.7-5.4% while reducing token usage by 21.3-44.8%.

However, multi-agent systems create novel alignment challenges through emergent social dynamics. We present Constitutional Evolution, a framework for automatically discovering behavioral norms in multi-agent LLM systems. Using a grid-world simulation with survival pressure, we study the tension between individual and collective welfare, quantified via a Societal Stability Score S in [0,1] that combines productivity, survival, and conflict metrics. Adversarial constitutions lead to societal collapse (S= 0), while vague prosocial principles (\"be helpful, harmless, honest\") produce inconsistent coordination (S = 0.249). Even constitutions designed by Claude 4.5 Opus with explicit knowledge of the objective achieve only moderate performance (S= 0.332). Using LLM-driven genetic programming with multi-island evolution, we evolve constitutions maximizing social welfare without explicit guidance toward cooperation. The evolved constitution C* achieves S = 0.556 +/- 0.008 (123% higher than human-designed baselines, N = 10), eliminates conflict, and discovers that minimizing communication (0.9% vs 62.2% social actions) outperforms verbose coordination.

A common approach, such as a heuristic with human intervention or training a single centralized RL policy or synchronizing updates across multiple learners, struggles with scalability and straggler effects. We address this by proposing an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) framework in which independent PPO agents, one per service, plan routes in parallel and commit resource deltas to a shared global resource environment. This coordination by state preserves feasibility across services and enables specialization for service-specific objectives. We evaluate the method on an O-RAN like network simulation using nearly real-time traffic data from the city of Montreal. We compared against a single-agent PPO baseline. AMARL achieves a similar Grade of Service (acceptance rate) (GoS) and end-to-end latency, with reduced training wall-clock time and improved robustness to demand shifts.

FL mitigates this issue by enabling decentralized training, but practical deployments face challenges due to client heterogeneity in computational resources, application requirements, and model architectures. We argue that while replacing data with model parameters characterizes the present of FL, replacing parameters with preferences represents a more scalable and privacy-preserving future. Motivated by this perspective, we propose MoR, a federated alignment framework based on GRPO with Mixture-of-Rewards for heterogeneous VLMs. MoR initializes a visual foundation model as a KL-regularized reference, while each client locally trains a reward model from local preference annotations, capturing specific evaluation signals without exposing raw data. To reconcile heterogeneous rewards, we introduce a routing-based fusion mechanism that adaptively aggregates client reward signals. Finally, the server performs GRPO with this mixed reward to optimize the base VLM. Experiments on three public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MoR consistently outperforms federated alignment baselines in generalization, robustness, and cross-client adaptability.

We formalize this setting and present a general confidence sequence framework for SWF-based online learning and inference, valid for any monotonic, concave, and Lipschitz-continuous SWF. Our key insight is that monotonicity alone suffices to lift confidence sequences from individual utilities to anytime-valid bounds on optimal welfare. Building on this foundation, we propose SWF-UCB, a SWF-agnostic online learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal $\\tilde{O}(n+\\sqrt{nkT})$ regret (for $k$ resources distributed among $n$ individuals at each of $T$ time steps). We instantiate our framework on three normatively distinct SWF families: Weighted Power Mean, Kolm, and Gini, providing bespoke oracle algorithms for each.

First, we prove that rank-$r$ LoRA cannot memorize all possible label assignments once the sample size exceeds $O(r(d+k-r))$, limiting its capacity to fit arbitrary noise. Second, we derive an optimal rank balancing approximation bias and noise-induced variance, showing it decreases with noise rate.

In this work, we investigate evolutionary methods for constructing highly nonlinear idempotent Boolean functions for dimensions $n=5$ up to $n=12$ using a polynomial basis representation with canonical primitive polynomials.

This results in redundant models, high maintenance cost, and limited performance gains despite substantial overlap in domain knowledge and reasoning patterns.

We construct reasoning-augmented corpora that pair structured supervision with step-by-step natural language explanations. A multi-task supervised fine-tuning stage with adaptive reweighting enables AdNanny to handle diverse labeling and generation tasks in a consistent reasoning format. This is followed by reinforcement learning using downstream advertising metrics to align model behavior with online retrieval and ranking objectives. AdNanny is deployed in production within Bing Ads, where it significantly reduces manual labeling effort and improves accuracy across multiple offline tasks.

Unlike prior works that focus on digital or analog circuits alone, PCB design must handle heterogeneous digital, analog, and power signals while adhering to real-world IC packages and pin constraints.

We introduce PCBSchemaGen, the first training-free framework for PCB schematic design that comprises LLM agent and Constraint-guided synthesis. Our approach makes three contributions: 1. an LLM-based code generation paradigm with iterative feedback with domain-specific prompts. 2. a verification framework leveraging a real-world IC datasheet derived Knowledge Graph (KG) and Subgraph Isomorphism encoding pin-role semantics and topological constraints. 3. an extensive experiment on 23 PCB schematic tasks spanning digital, analog, and power domains.

Standard optimization relies on reparameterized gradient estimators, which are well-studied theoretically yet restrict both the choice of the data-generating process and the variational approximation. While REINFORCE gradient estimators do not suffer from such restrictions, they lack rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of REINFORCE gradient estimators in importance weighted VI, leveraging this theoretical foundation to diagnose and resolve fundamental deficiencies in current state-of-the-art estimators. Specifically, we introduce and examine a generalized family of variational inference for Monte Carlo objectives (VIMCO) gradient estimators. We prove that state-of-the-art VIMCO gradient estimators exhibit a vanishing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as $N$ increases, which prevents effective optimization. To overcome this issue, we propose the novel VIMCO-$\\star$ gradient estimator and show that it averts the SNR collapse of existing VIMCO gradient estimators by achieving a $\\sqrt{N}$ SNR scaling instead.

However, we identify a critical trade-off: while unconstrained RFT achieves strong reasoning performance, it severely compromises model trustworthiness by amplifying hallucination and worsening calibration; conversely, RKL-constrained RFT preserves trustworthiness but limits reasoning gains due to its unbounded penalty on exploratory deviations. To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence. CARE-RFT provides a confidence-sensitive penalty: it is bounded for confident, consistently rewarded explorations to enable reasoning, while unbounded elsewhere to preserve calibration. Extensive experiments across multiple model scales and RFT algorithms show that CARE-RFT achieves a superior balance, matching the reasoning performance of unconstrained RFT while recovering the trustworthiness and calibration of the base model.

This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity. This helps enforcing a quality-diversity trade-off throughout the user history. Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa.

In this paper, we analyze open-source Android apps to (1) compare CI adopters and non-adopters, (2) characterize adoption patterns using activity and bug metrics, and (3) assess pre/post adoption changes and user-facing outcomes. We observe that CI adopters are larger and more active, with faster and more regular releases. CI adoption is concentrated in integration- and reliability-intensive categories (e.g., finance and productivity) and is associated with higher Google Play Store engagement (more downloads and reviews) without lower ratings. Overall, CI adoption aligns with practices that support sustained delivery, higher project visibility, and stronger user engagement in mobile ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u6e90\u5b89\u5353\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\uff08CI\uff09\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CI\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u66f4\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8c37\u6b4c\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u65b0\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\uff0cCI\u867d\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u6e90\u5b89\u5353\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4CI\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u548c\u975e\u91c7\u7528\u8005\uff0c\u7528\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u7f3a\u9677\u6307\u6807\u523b\u753b\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u540e\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9762\u5411\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "CI\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u66f4\u5927\u66f4\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bc6\u96c6\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5173\u8054\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8c37\u6b4c\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e14\u8bc4\u7ea7\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CI\u91c7\u7528\u7b26\u5408\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u4ea4\u4ed8\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u9879\u76ee\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u79fb\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

In its standard form, self-attention incurs costs that increase with context length, driving demand for storage, compute, and energy that is now outstripping society's ability to provide them. To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible. We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness. Our work enables unbounded token generation at modest fixed cost, substantially reducing the infrastructure and energy demands of large-scale Transformer models.

To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID.

However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength.

Our analysis reveals LLMs fail to compete against traditional algorithms and identifies three recurring flaws: reliance on heuristics, factual misunderstandings, and a \"knowing-doing\" gap where actions diverge from reasoning. An initial attempt with behavior cloning and step-level reinforcement learning improves reasoning style but remains insufficient for accurate game-theoretic play.

Additionally, recent efforts have demonstrated that the sigmoid gate is provably more sample-efficient than its softmax counterpart under regression settings. Nevertheless, there are three notable concerns that have not been addressed in the literature, namely (i) the benefits of the sigmoid gate have not been established under classification settings; (ii) existing sigmoid-gated MoE models may not converge to their ground-truth; and (iii) the effects of a temperature parameter in the sigmoid gate remain theoretically underexplored. To tackle these open problems, we perform a comprehensive analysis of multinomial logistic MoE equipped with a modified sigmoid gate to ensure model convergence. Our results indicate that the sigmoid gate exhibits a lower sample complexity than the softmax gate for both parameter and expert estimation. Furthermore, we find that incorporating a temperature into the sigmoid gate leads to a sample complexity of exponential order due to an intrinsic interaction between the temperature and gating parameters.

STM transforms continuous time series values into symbol tokens with quantization techniques based on human cognitive structures, and captures temporal dynamics through structured transformations of symbols, enabling fast engineering based predictions in which language models focus on critical parts of time series data. STM is a general purpose mechanisms that ensure the integrity of backbone language models, but they significantly improve their efficiency by inferring the dynamic and structured patterns inherent in time series data. We evaluated STM on various time series datasets, paired with four small language models (SLM) with limited computational environments. For all models, STM achieves error reductions of up to 69% in MAE and 90% in MSE compared to the default backbone SLM without STM. These results demonstrate the potential of STM as an efficient, adaptable layer for symbol-driven time series prediction using foundation models. The accuracy improvements were made at negligible resource costs, with maximum GPU memory of the base model increasing by approximately 0.06% and latency overhead increasing by only 0.64%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u8fc7\u6e21\u673a\u5236\uff08STM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u503c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u56db\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u642d\u914d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cSTM\u4f7fMAE\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e69%\uff0cMSE\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e90%\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927GPU\u5185\u5b58\u589e\u52a0\u7ea60.06%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u589e\u52a00.64%\u3002", "conclusion": "STM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5c42\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We first conduct a preliminary study on artifacts from top-tier SE conferences and identify three key challenges: perceiving execution states, maintaining stable execution environments, and recovering from execution errors. Inspired by these findings, we propose ArtifactCopilot, the first end-to-end agent-based framework for automated artifact evaluation.

To this end, researchers typically leverage multi-modal information from structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) to complete downstream tasks. Recent methodologies explore the intricate coupling mechanisms between SC and FC, attempting to fuse their representations at the regional level. However, lacking fundamental neuroscientific insight, these approaches fail to uncover the latent interactions between neural regions underlying these connectomes, and thus cannot explain why SC and FC exhibit dynamic states of both coupling and heterogeneity. In this paper, we formulate multi-modal fusion through the lens of neural communication dynamics and propose the Adaptive Flow Routing Network (AFR-Net), a physics-informed framework that models how structural constraints (SC) give rise to functional communication patterns (FC), enabling interpretable discovery of critical neural pathways. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Despite its popularity, its theoretical foundations and behavior under distributional shift remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a principled statistical interpretation by proving that EDL training corresponds to amortized variational inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model with a tempered pseudo-likelihood. This perspective reveals a major drawback: standard EDL conflates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, leading to systematic overconfidence on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. To address this, we introduce Density-Informed Pseudo-count EDL (DIP-EDL), a new parametrization that decouples class prediction from the magnitude of uncertainty by separately estimating the conditional label distribution and the marginal covariate density. This separation preserves evidence in high-density regions while shrinking predictions toward a uniform prior for OOD data. Theoretically, we prove that DIP-EDL achieves asymptotic concentration.

Our method leverages atomic concept edits (ACEs), which are targeted operations that add, remove, or replace an interpretable concept in the input prompt. By systematically applying ACEs and observing the resulting effects on model behavior across various tasks, our framework learns a causal mapping from edits to predictable outcomes. This learned constitution provides deep, generalizable insights into the model. Empirically, we validate our approach across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and text-to-image alignment, for controlling and understanding model behavior. We found that for text-to-image generation, GPT-Image tends to focus on grammatical adherence, while Imagen 4 prioritizes atmospheric coherence. In mathematical reasoning, distractor variables confuse GPT-5 but leave Gemini 2.5 models and o4-mini largely unaffected.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization.

To drive the research towards better coding agents, we require challenging benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the ability of such agents to perform various software engineering tasks. However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks.

A significant challenge for these communities is achieving self-sufficiency through effective management of the balance between energy production and consumption.

However, the application of forecasting solutions is often hindered by privacy constrains and regulations as the users participating in the Local Energy Community can be (rightfully) reluctant sharing their consumption patterns with others.

This saturation largely stems from the dominance of template-based computation and shallow arithmetic decomposition in existing datasets, which underrepresent reasoning skills such as multi-constraint coordination, constructive logical synthesis, and spatial inference. To address this gap, we introduce ReasoningMath-Plus, a benchmark of 150 carefully curated problems explicitly designed to evaluate structural reasoning. Each problem emphasizes reasoning under interacting constraints, constructive solution formation, or non-trivial structural insight, and is annotated with a minimal reasoning skeleton to support fine-grained process-level evaluation. Alongside the dataset, we introduce HCRS (Hazard-aware Chain-based Rule Score), a deterministic step-level scoring function, and train a Process Reward Model (PRM) on the annotated reasoning traces. Empirically, while leading models attain relatively high final-answer accuracy (up to 5.8/10), HCRS-based holistic evaluation yields substantially lower scores (average 4.36/10, best 5.14/10), showing that answer-only metrics can overestimate reasoning robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReasoningMath - Plus\u57fa\u51c6\u548cHCRS\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4ec5\u770b\u7b54\u6848\u6307\u6807\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5982\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u534f\u8c03\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ReasoningMath - Plus\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHCRS\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46HCRS\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5206\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u770b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

Two dominant notions of fairness have emerged in the literature: Group Fairness (GF), which focuses on mitigating disparities across demographic subpopulations, and Individual Fairness (IF), which emphasizes consistent treatment of similar individuals. These notions have traditionally been studied in isolation. In contrast, this survey examines methods that jointly address GF and IF, integrating both perspectives within unified frameworks and explicitly characterizing the trade-offs between them. We provide a systematic and critical review of hybrid fairness approaches, organizing existing methods according to the fairness mechanisms they employ and the algorithmic and mathematical strategies used to reconcile multiple fairness criteria. For each class of methods, we examine their theoretical foundations, optimization mechanisms, and empirical evaluation practices, and discuss their limitations. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and identify open research directions for developing principled, context-aware hybrid fairness methods.

To address this, we propose PPoGA (Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action), a novel KGQA framework inspired by human cognitive control and problem-solving. PPoGA incorporates a Planner-Executor architecture to separate high-level strategy from low-level execution and leverages a Predictive Processing mechanism to anticipate outcomes. The core innovation of our work is a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to perform not only Path Correction for local execution errors but also Plan Correction by identifying, discarding, and reformulating the entire plan when it proves ineffective. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging multi-hop KGQA benchmarks: GrailQA, CWQ, and WebQSP.

However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRACA\u8986\u76d6\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8986\u76d6\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9LLM\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RACA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8868\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8986\u76d6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "RACA\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u793a\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "conclusion": "RACA\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u662fAI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

While CoT helps LLMs and VLMs articulate intermediate steps, its text-only form often fails on vision-intensive problems where key intermediate states are inherently visual. We introduce modal-mixed CoT, which interleaves textual tokens with compact visual sketches represented as latent embeddings. To bridge the modality gap without eroding the original knowledge and capability of the VLM, we use the VLM itself as an encoder and train the language backbone to reconstruct its own intermediate vision embeddings, to guarantee the semantic alignment of the visual latent space. We further attach a diffusion-based latent decoder, invoked by a special control token and conditioned on hidden states from the VLM. In this way, the diffusion head carries fine-grained perceptual details while the VLM specifies high-level intent, which cleanly disentangles roles and reduces the optimization pressure of the VLM. Training proceeds in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on traces that interleave text and latents with a joint next-token and latent-reconstruction objective, followed by reinforcement learning that teaches when to switch modalities and how to compose long reasoning chains.

This work presents MediGRAF (Medical Graph Retrieval Augmented Framework), a novel hybrid Graph RAG system that bridges this gap. By uniquely combining Neo4j Text2Cypher capabilities for structured relationship traversal with vector embeddings for unstructured narrative retrieval, MediGRAF enables natural language querying of the complete patient journey. Using 10 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset (generating 5,973 nodes and 5,963 relationships), we generated enough nodes and data for patient level question answering (QA), and we evaluated this architecture across varying query complexities. The system demonstrated 100\\% recall for factual queries which means all relevant information was retrieved and in the output, while complex inference tasks achieved a mean expert quality score of 4.25/5 with zero safety violations.

This paper presents a mapping study by considering robotics testing papers and relating them to the software testing theory.

Traditional heuristic tour constructors, such as Farthest or Nearest Insertion, are computationally efficient and highly practical, but their deterministic behavior limits exploration and often leads to local optima. In contrast, neural-based heuristic tour constructors alleviate this issue through guided-sampling and typically achieve superior solution quality, but at the cost of extensive training and reliance on ground-truth supervision, hindering their practical use. To bridge this gap, we propose TSP-MDF, a novel instance modification framework that equips traditional deterministic heuristic tour constructors with guided-sampling capability. Specifically, TSP-MDF introduces a neural-based instance modifier that strategically shifts node coordinates to sample multiple modified instances, on which the base traditional heuristic tour constructor constructs tours that are mapped back to the original instance, allowing traditional tour constructors to explore higher-quality tours and escape local optima. At the same time, benefiting from our instance modification formulation, the neural-based instance modifier can be trained efficiently without any ground-truth supervision, ensuring the framework maintains practicality. Extensive experiments on large-scale TSP benchmarks and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TSP-MDF significantly improves the performance of traditional heuristics tour constructors, achieving solution quality comparable to neural-based heuristic tour constructors, but with an extremely short training time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTSP - MDF\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u9020\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u9020\u5668\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6784\u9020\u5668\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTSP - MDF\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4fee\u6539\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4fee\u6539\u5668\u79fb\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5750\u6807\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6784\u9020\u5668\u5728\u4fee\u6539\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u6784\u9020\u8def\u5f84\u518d\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21TSP\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTSP - MDF\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6784\u9020\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u77ed\u3002", "conclusion": "TSP - MDF\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We recast associative memory at the level of probability measures, treating a context as a distribution over tokens and viewing attention as an integral operator on measures. Concretely, for mixture contexts $\u03bd= I^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^I \u03bc^{(i^*)}$ and a query $x_{\\mathrm{q}}(i^*)$, the task decomposes into (i) recall of the relevant component $\u03bc^{(i^*)}$ and (ii) prediction from $(\u03bc_{i^*},x_\\mathrm{q})$. We study learned softmax attention (not a frozen kernel) trained by empirical risk minimization and show that a shallow measure-theoretic Transformer composed with an MLP learns the recall-and-predict map under a spectral assumption on the input densities.

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of flaky builds in GitHub Actions based on rerun data from 1,960 open-source Java projects. Our results show that 3.2% of builds are rerun, and 67.73% of these rerun builds exhibit flaky behavior, affecting 1,055 (51.28%) of the projects. Through an in-depth failure analysis, we identify 15 distinct categories of flaky failures, among which flaky tests, network issues, and dependency resolution issues are the most prevalent.

This privacy-oriented approach makes PPFL a highly suitable solution for training shared models in sectors where data privacy is a critical concern. In traditional FL, local models are trained on edge devices, and only model updates are shared with a central server, which aggregates them to improve the global model. However, despite the presence of the aforementioned privacy techniques, in the classical Federated structure, the issue of the server as a single-point-of-failure remains, leading to limitations both in terms of security and scalability.

We study two complementary consolidation strategies: data-level consolidation, which jointly trains a unified model on a mixture of domain-specific datasets, and parameter-level consolidation, which merges independently trained agent models at the parameter level. Our analysis compares these approaches in terms of performance retention, cross-domain generalization, and interference across information-seeking behaviors. Our results show that data-level consolidation remains a strong and stable baseline, while parameter-level consolidation offers a promising, efficient alternative but suffers from interference and robustness challenges.

In real-world mortgage datasets, however, three factors frequently undermine evaluation validity and deployment reliability: ambiguity in default labeling, severe class imbalance, and information leakage arising from temporal structure and post-event variables. We compare multiple machine learning approaches for mortgage default prediction using a real-world loan-level dataset, with emphasis on leakage control and imbalance handling. We employ leakage-aware feature selection, a strict temporal split that constrains both origination and reporting periods, and controlled downsampling of the majority class. Across multiple positive-to-negative ratios, performance remains stable, and an AutoML approach (AutoGluon) achieves the strongest AUROC among the models evaluated.

Disk forensics, one of the most widely used techniques in digital investigations, faces distinct obstacles on each platform. Windows, with its predominantly NTFS and FAT file systems, typically supports reliable disk imaging and analysis through established tools such as FTK Imager and Autopsy/Sleuth Kit. However, encryption features frequently pose challenges to evidence acquisition. Conversely, Linux environments, which rely on file systems like ext4 and XFS, generally offer greater transparency, yet the transient nature of log retention often complicates forensic analysis. In instances where anti-forensic strategies such as encryption and compression render traditional disk forensics insufficient, memory forensics becomes crucial. While memory forensic methodologies demonstrate robustness across Windows and Linux platforms forms through frameworks like Volatility, platform-specific difficulties persist. Memory analysis on Linux systems benefits from tools like LiME, snapshot utilities, and dd for memory acquisition; nevertheless, live memory acquisition on Linux can still present challenges. This research systematically assesses both disk and memory forensic acquisition techniques across samples representing Windows and Linux systems. By identifying effective combinations of forensic tools and configurations tailored to each operating system, the study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of evidence collection. It further evaluates current forensic tools and highlights a persistent gap: consistently assuring forensic input reliability and footprint integrity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Windows\u548cLinux\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u78c1\u76d8\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u53d6\u8bc1\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc1\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u53d6\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\u7f51\u7edc\u53d6\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u78c1\u76d8\u53d6\u8bc1\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc1\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30Windows\u548cLinux\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u78c1\u76d8\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u53d6\u8bc1\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u9002\u5408\u5404\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d6\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u78c1\u76d8\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u53d6\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982Windows\u78c1\u76d8\u53d6\u8bc1\u53d7\u52a0\u5bc6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cLinux\u78c1\u76d8\u53d6\u8bc1\u53d7\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u53d6\u8bc1\u867d\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5e73\u53f0\u7279\u5b9a\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u53d6\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5373\u65e0\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53d6\u8bc1\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8db3\u8ff9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

Privocracy is an access control mechanism that minimizes the need to attribute high privileges by triggering a secure e-voting procedure to run commands that require using sensitive resources. With Privocracy an organization can distribute trust in resource access, minimizing the system vulnerabilities from single points of failure, all while maintaining the high flexibility of discretionary access control policies.\n  The Privocracy voting mechanism achieves everlasting privacy, ensuring votes remain confidential regardless of an adversary's computational power, while addressing the dependability requirements of a practical and secure system. The procedure incorporates useful features such as vote delegation to reduce voter fatigue, rapid voting rounds to enable quick action during emergencies, and selective vote auditing for application-level accountability. Our experimental results demonstrate that Privocracy processes votes efficiently and can be deployed on commodity hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdPrivocracy\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u6743\u9650\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6295\u7968\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6295\u7968\u5e76\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5546\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6743\u9650\u7528\u6237\u6613\u81f4\u654f\u611f\u6587\u4ef6\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u9700\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u6743\u9650\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u7535\u5b50\u6295\u7968\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fd0\u884c\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u654f\u611f\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0Privocracy\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "Privocracy\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5546\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "Privocracy\u53ef\u5206\u6563\u8d44\u6e90\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c38\u4e45\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

We propose a simple and data-efficient approach that enables audio-to-image retrieval without any audio-image supervision. Our proposed method uses text as a semantic intermediary: we distill the text embedding space of a pretrained image-text model (BioCLIP-2), which encodes rich visual and taxonomic structure, into a pretrained audio-text model (BioLingual) by fine-tuning its audio encoder with a contrastive objective. This distillation transfers visually grounded semantics into the audio representation, inducing emergent alignment between audio and image embeddings without using images during training. We evaluate the resulting model on multiple bioacoustic benchmarks. The distilled audio encoder preserves audio discriminative power while substantially improving audio-text alignment on focal recordings and soundscape datasets. Most importantly, on the SSW60 benchmark, the proposed approach achieves strong audio-to-image retrieval performance exceeding baselines based on zero-shot model combinations or learned mappings between text embeddings, despite not training on paired audio-image data.

This agent employs iterative self-verification and in-loop hacking detection to ensure the reliable generation of high-fidelity, verifiable tasks. Using this method, we scale the number of real-world multilingual SWE environments to a million scale (807,693).

However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFUPareto\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMBS\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6269\u5c55\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u96c6\u6210MGDA\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "FUPareto\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FUPareto\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by the ``Memory Wall,'' restricting practical deployments to low resolutions (e.g., $64 \\times 64$). This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \\textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \\times 480$ resolution -- a $50\\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms.

This formulation induces structured interaction among agents while preserving alignment between agent and principal objectives.

However, ensuring the correctness of these libraries remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of mature testing methodologies. The state-of-the-art tools often rely on domain-specific configurations and expert knowledge, which limits their accessibility and scalability in practice. Furthermore, although these tools demonstrate strong performance, they adopt measurement-based for output validation in testing, which makes them produce false positive reports.\n  To alleviate these limitations, we propose QSPE, a practical approach that follows the differential testing principle and extends the existing approach, SPE, for quantum libraries. QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $\u03b1$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries.

While classical AI-based methods have been developed for early diagnosis and stage classification of AD, growing data volumes and limited computational resources necessitate faster, more efficient approaches. Quantum-based AI methods, which leverage superposition and entanglement principles along with high-dimensional Hilbert space, can surpass classical approaches' limitations and offer higher accuracy for high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy data. In this study, a Quantum-Based Parallel Model (QBPM) architecture is proposed for the efficient classification of AD stages using MRI datasets, inspired by the principles of classical model parallelism. The proposed model leverages quantum advantages by employing two distinct quantum circuits, each incorporating rotational and entanglement blocks, running in parallel on the same quantum simulator. The classification performance of the model was evaluated on two different datasets to assess its overall robustness and generalization capability. The proposed model demonstrated high classification accuracy across both datasets, highlighting its overall robustness and generalization capability. Results obtained under high-level Gaussian noise, simulating real-world conditions, further provided experimental evidence for the model's applicability not only in theoretical but also in practical scenarios. Moreover, compared with five different classical transfer learning methods, the proposed model demonstrated its efficiency as an alternative to classical approaches by achieving higher classification accuracy and comparable execution time while utilizing fewer circuit parameters.

We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers.

We formalize this tension through a total variation (TV) lens: once the reference conditional distribution is fixed, any nontrivial reduction in unsafe generations necessarily incurs TV deviation from the reference, yielding a principled Safety-Prompt Alignment Trade-off (SPAT). Guided by this view, we propose an inference-only prompt projection framework that selectively intervenes on high-risk prompts via a surrogate objective with verification, mapping them into a tolerance-controlled safe set while leaving benign prompts effectively unchanged, without retraining or fine-tuning the generator. Across four datasets and three diffusion backbones, our approach achieves 16.7-60.0% relative reductions in inappropriate percentage (IP) versus strong model-level alignment baselines, while preserving benign prompt-image alignment on COCO near the unaligned reference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6295\u5f71\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5f53\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u751f\u6210\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6295\u5f71\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f53\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e16.7 - 60.0%\uff0c\u5728COCO\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u63a5\u8fd1\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We present SpeechLess, a wearable AR assistant that introduces a speech-based intent granularity control paradigm grounded in personalized spatial memory. SpeechLess helps users \"speak less,\" while still obtaining the information they need, and supports gradual explicitation of intent when more complex expression is required. SpeechLess binds prior interactions to multimodal personal context-space, time, activity, and referents-to form spatial memories, and leverages them to extrapolate missing intent dimensions from under-specified user queries. This enables users to dynamically adjust how explicitly they express their informational needs, from full-utterance to micro/zero-utterance interaction. We motivate our design through a week-long formative study using a commercial smart glasses platform, revealing discomfort with public voice use, frustration with repetitive speech, and hardware constraints. Building on these insights, we design SpeechLess, and evaluate it through controlled lab and in-the-wild studies.

Despite the increase in firmware size, many embedded devices, such as robotic vehicles (RVs), operate in distinct modes, each requiring only a small subset of the firmware code at runtime. We refer to such devices as mode-based embedded devices. Debloating is an approach to reduce attack surfaces by removing or restricting unneeded code, but existing techniques suffer from significant limitations, such as coarse granularity and irreversible code removal, limiting their applicability.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RVDebloater, a novel adaptive debloating technique for mode-based embedded devices that automatically identifies unneeded firmware code for each mode using either static or dynamic analysis, and dynamically debloats the firmware for each mode at the function level at runtime. RVDebloater introduces a new software-based enforcement approach that supports diverse mode-based embedded devices. We implemented RVDebloater using the LLVM compiler and evaluated its efficiency and effectiveness on six different RVs, including both simulated and real ones, with different real-world missions. We find that device requirements change throughout its lifetime for each mode, and that many critical firmware functions can be restricted in other modes, with an average of 85% of functions not being required. The results showed that none of the missions failed after debloating with RVDebloater, indicating that it neither incurred false positives nor false negatives. Further, RVDebloater prunes the firmware call graph by an average of 45% across different firmware. Finally, RVDebloater incurred an average performance overhead of 3.9% and memory overhead of 4% (approximately 0.25 MB) on real RVs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRVDebloater\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53bb\u81c3\u80bf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u56fa\u4ef6\u589e\u5927\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u81c3\u80bf\u6280\u672f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRVDebloater\uff0c\u7528\u9759\u6001\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51fd\u6570\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u53bb\u81c3\u80bf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u5907\u5404\u6a21\u5f0f\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e73\u574785%\u51fd\u6570\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\uff1b\u53bb\u81c3\u80bf\u540e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5e73\u5747\u4fee\u526a45%\u56fa\u4ef6\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\uff1b\u771f\u5b9eRV\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u95003.9%\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u95004%\uff08\u7ea60.25MB\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RVDebloater\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u65e0\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u3002"}}

Most plants rely on scheduled preventive maintenance, since existing predictive maintenance models, often based on opaque machine learning methods, lack interpretability and operator trust. This study proposes an explainable prognostic framework for UF membrane remaining useful life (RUL) estimation using fuzzy similarity reasoning. A physics-informed Health Index, derived from transmembrane pressure, flux, and resistance, captures degradation dynamics, which are then fuzzified via Gaussian membership functions. Using a similarity measure, the model identifies historical degradation trajectories resembling the current state and formulates RUL predictions as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. Each rule corresponds to a historical exemplar and contributes to a transparent, similarity-weighted RUL estimate.

While convergence rates for estimating the embedding of a single measure from $m$ samples are well understood, the literature has not addressed the setting involving multiple measures. In this paper, we study PCA in a double asymptotic regime where $n$ probability measures are observed, each through $m$ samples. We derive convergence rates of the form $n^{-1/2} + m^{-\u03b1}$ for the empirical covariance operator and the PCA excess risk, where $\u03b1>0$ depends on the chosen embedding. This characterizes the relationship between the number $n$ of measures and the number $m$ of samples per measure, revealing a sparse (small $m$) to dense (large $m$) transition in the convergence behavior. Moreover, we prove that the dense-regime rate is minimax optimal for the empirical covariance error.

These findings replicate across ImageNet and CIFAR-10, and generalize to NLP: effective dimension predicts performance for 8 encoder models on SST-2/MNLI and 15 decoder-only LLMs on AG News (r=0.69, p=0.004), while model size does not (r=0.07). We establish bidirectional causality: degrading geometry via noise causes accuracy loss (r=-0.94, $p < 10^(-9)$), while improving geometry via PCA maintains accuracy across architectures (-0.03pp at 95% variance).

In this work, we propose unifying the study of adversarial robustness in text scoring models spanning dense retrievers, rerankers, and reward models. This motivates adapting both attacks and adversarial training methods across model roles. Unlike open-ended generation, text scoring failures are directly testable: an attack succeeds when an irrelevant or rejected text outscores a relevant or chosen one. Using this principled lens of text scoring, we demonstrate that current adversarial training formulations for language models are often short-sighted, failing to effectively generalize across attacks. To address this, we introduce multiple adversarial training methods for text scoring models and show that combining complementary training methods can yield strong robustness while also improving task effectiveness. We also highlight the practical value of our approach for RLHF, showing that our adversarially trained reward models mitigate reward hacking and support the training of better-aligned LLMs. We provide our code and models for further study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5bf9RLHF\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u5171\u540c\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u516c\u5f0f\u77ed\u89c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6240\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f9b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316LLM\u4ee3\u7406SEISMO\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SEISMO\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u6807\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u572823\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad82 - 3\u500d\uff0c50\u6b21\u8c03\u7528\u5185\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Our approach learns a conditional generative model separately for each source domain and calibrates the generated responses to the target domain via conditional quantile matching. This distributional alignment step corrects general discrepancies between source and target domains without imposing restrictive assumptions such as covariate or label shift. The resulting framework provides a principled and flexible approach to high-quality data augmentation for downstream learning tasks in the target domain. From a theoretical perspective, we show that an empirical risk minimizer (ERM) trained on the augmented dataset achieves a tighter excess risk bound than the target-only ERM under mild conditions. In particular, we establish new convergence rates for the quantile matching estimator that governs the transfer bias-variance tradeoff.

Beyond analysis, probes are often used operationally in probe-then-steer pipelines: a learned concept vector is extracted from a probe and injected via additive activation steering by adding it to a layer representation during the forward pass. The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations. Finally, using the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), we provide a mechanistic characterization of ridge logistic regression in an idealized Gaussian teacher-student model in the high-dimensional few-shot regime, explaining how penalty strength mediates probe accuracy and concept-vector stability and yielding structural predictions that qualitatively align with trends observed on real LLM embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRAPTOR\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5cad\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a2\u9488 - \u5f15\u5bfc\u7ba1\u9053\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u51faRAPTOR\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faL2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a2\u9488RAPTOR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8c03\u6574\u5cad\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f97\u5230\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u5e08\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "RAPTOR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f15\u5bfc\u6f14\u793a\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "RAPTOR\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5cad\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u5b9a\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain.

We address this open question by establishing the first general framework for establishing generalization guarantees for tuning multi-dimensional hyperparameters in data-driven settings. Our approach strengthens the generalization guarantee framework for semi-algebraic function classes by exploiting tools from real algebraic geometry, yielding sharper, more broadly applicable guarantees. We then extend the analysis to hyperparameter tuning using the validation loss under minimal assumptions, and derive improved bounds when additional structure is available.

However, some questions require inference, i.e., deriving answers that are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the available information. We introduce Inferential QA -- a new task that challenges models to infer answers from answer-supporting passages which provide only clues. To study this problem, we construct QUIT (QUestions requiring Inference from Texts) dataset, comprising 7,401 questions and 2.4M passages built from high-convergence human- and machine-authored hints, labeled across three relevance levels using LLM-based answerability and human verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of retrievers, rerankers, and LLM-based readers, we show that methods effective on traditional QA tasks struggle in inferential QA: retrievers underperform, rerankers offer limited gains, and fine-tuning provides inconsistent improvements. Even reasoning-oriented LLMs fail to outperform smaller general-purpose models. These findings reveal that current QA pipelines are not yet ready for inference-based reasoning.

We first show that this $\\log d$ factor in the sample complexity persists for full-batch spherical GD on the correlation loss; however, by simply truncating the activation, full-batch GD exhibits a favorable optimization landscape at $n \\simeq d$ samples, thereby outperforming one-pass SGD (with the same activation) in statistical efficiency. We complement this result with a trajectory analysis of full-batch GD on the squared loss from small initialization, showing that $n \\gtrsim d$ samples and $T \\gtrsim\\log d$ gradient steps suffice to achieve strong (exact) recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u6307\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5168\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08GD\uff09\u548c\u5355\u904d\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08online SGD\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u622a\u65ad\u6fc0\u6d3b\u540e\u5168\u6279\u91cfGD\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eonline SGD\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u6570\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u6570\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9664\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5916\uff0c\u5168\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u5bf9\u5355\u904d\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u6307\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e24\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684d\u7ef4\u5355\u6307\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5168\u6279\u91cf\u7403\u5f62GD\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fdb\u884c\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u5c0f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\u5168\u6279\u91cfGD\u5728\u5e73\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u6279\u91cf\u7403\u5f62GD\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684log d\u56e0\u5b50\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u622a\u65ad\u6fc0\u6d3b\u540e\uff0cn\u2248d\u65f6\u5168\u6279\u91cfGD\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u904dSGD\uff1b\u5c0f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\uff0cn\u2273d\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u548cT\u2273log d\u6b21\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u622a\u65ad\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53ef\u4f7f\u5168\u6279\u91cfGD\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u904dSGD\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

In this paper, we formulate block removal as a constrained binary optimization problem that can be mapped to a physical system (Ising model), whose energies are a strong proxy for downstream model performance. This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture.

We introduce PARSE, the first open-domain Persian reasoning QA benchmark, containing 10,800 questions across Boolean, multiple-choice, and factoid formats, with diverse reasoning types, difficulty levels, and answer structures. The benchmark is built via a controlled LLM-based generation pipeline and validated through human evaluation. We also ensure linguistic and factual quality through multi-stage filtering, annotation, and consistency checks. We benchmark multilingual and Persian LLMs under multiple prompting strategies and show that Persian prompts and structured prompting (CoT for Boolean/multiple-choice; few-shot for factoid) improve performance. Fine-tuning further boosts results, especially for Persian-specialized models. These findings highlight how PARSE supports both fair comparison and practical model adaptation.

Standard uniform quantizers assume that parameters are evenly distributed, an assumption at odds with the highly skewed distributions observed in practice. We propose Benford-Quant, a simple, data-free non-uniform quantizer inspired by Benford's Law, which predicts that leading digits follow a logarithmic distribution. Benford-Quant replaces the uniform grid with a log-spaced codebook, dedicating more resolution to the frequent small-magnitude weights. We provide both theoretical intuition and empirical evidence: (i) weights in transformer transformational layers adhere closely to Benford statistics, while normalization layers systematically deviate; (ii) on Small Language Models (SLMs), Benford-Quant consistently improves perplexity, reducing 4-bit perplexity on Gemma-270M by more than 10%; and (iii) on larger LLMs, it remains competitive, with differences explained by over-parameterization effects. Our results indicate that incorporating a Benford-inspired prior into quantization grids is a low-cost modification that yields accuracy gains in aggressive few-bit regimes. Although it is not able to surpass the state of the art in tasks such as perplexity and LAMBADA, the Benford-Quant approach can be hybridized with other quantization methods-such as SmoothQuant and Activation-Aware Quantization-without major pipeline modification, potentially improving their performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u672c\u798f\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u5668Benford - Quant\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u6570\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBenford - Quant\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u95f4\u9694\u7801\u672c\u4ee3\u66ff\u5747\u5300\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u8f6c\u6362\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u7b26\u5408\u672c\u798f\u7279\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5728\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u672c\u798f\u7279\u542f\u53d1\u5148\u9a8c\u7eb3\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u662f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u3002"}}

Memory creates what we refer to as the Algorithmic Self-portrait - a new form of personalization derived from users' self-disclosed information divulged within private conversations. While memory enables more coherent exchanges, the underlying processes of memory creation remain opaque, raising critical questions about data sensitivity, user agency, and the fidelity of the resulting portrait.\n  To bridge this research gap, we analyze 2,050 memory entries from 80 real-world ChatGPT users. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (1) A striking 96% of memories in our dataset are created unilaterally by the conversational system, potentially shifting agency away from the user; (2) Memories, in our dataset, contain a rich mix of GDPR-defined personal data (in 28% memories) along with psychological insights about participants (in 52% memories); and (3)~A significant majority of the memories (84%) are directly grounded in user context, indicating faithful representation of the conversations.

To mitigate these risks, current alignment strategies predominantly rely on heavy post-training paradigms or external interventions. However, these approaches are often computationally intensive and fail to address the inherent awareness-compliance gap, a critical misalignment where models recognize potential risks yet prioritize following user instructions due to their sycophantic tendencies. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Guard, a lightweight safety defense framework that reinforces safety compliance at the representational level. Self-Guard operates through two principal stages: (1) safety-oriented prompting, which activates the model's latent safety awareness to evoke spontaneous reflection, and (2) safety activation steering, which extracts the resulting directional shift in the hidden state space and amplifies it to ensure that safety compliance prevails over sycophancy during inference. Experiments demonstrate that Self-Guard effectively bridges the awareness-compliance gap, achieving robust safety performance without compromising model utility.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u6bd4\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u53e5\u5b50\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVA\u548cAlignedWVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5fae\u8c03\u503c\u805a\u5408\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u5927LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faValue Aggregation\uff08VA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u5c42\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5143\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u6c60\u5316\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAligned Weighted VA\uff08AlignedWVA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u9002\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cVA\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bAlignedWVA\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684MetaEOL\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u53e5\u5b50\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u503c\u805a\u5408\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This paper presents an industry case study of the ``Maria'' platform, a production-grade AI system in primary healthcare that addresses this gap.\n  Our central hypothesis is that trustworthy clinical AI is achieved through the holistic integration of four foundational engineering pillars. We present a synergistic architecture that combines Clean Architecture for maintainability with an Event-driven architecture for resilience and auditability. We introduce the Agent as the primary unit of modularity, each possessing its own autonomous MLOps lifecycle. Finally, we show how a Human-in-the-Loop governance model is technically integrated not merely as a safety check, but as a critical, event-driven data source for continuous improvement.

First, we design a physics-informed mask strategy to guide the diffusion generation process based on a local receptive field, effectively eliminating noise interference. Second, we impose a physics-informed constraint on the diffusion generation results following the kriging principle of geomagnetic maps, ensuring strict adherence to the laws of physics.

The high-dimensional characteristics and hidden critical signals further complicate early-warning tasks. This study proposes a novel early-warning framework that integrates manifold learning with stochastic dynamical system modeling. Through systematic comparison, six methods including diffusion maps (DM) are selected to construct low-dimensional representations. Based on these, a data-driven stochastic differential equation model is established to robustly estimate the probability evolution scoring function of the system. Building on this, a new Score Function (SF) indicator is defined by incorporating Schr\u00f6dinger bridge theory to quantify the likelihood of significant state transitions in the system. Experiments demonstrate that this indicator exhibits higher sensitivity and robustness in epilepsy prediction, enables earlier identification of critical points, and clearly captures dynamic features across various stages before and after seizure onset.

We also observe a second seemingly separate phenomenon: under fixed hyperparameters, the stochastic fine-tuning reward often rises, peaks, and then degrades in both ES and GRPO. We argue that both effects reflect a shared geometric property of fine-tuning landscapes: they are low-dimensional in curvature. A small set of high-curvature dimensions dominates improvement, producing (i) heterogeneous time scales that yield rise-then-decay under fixed stochasticity, as captured by a minimal quadratic stochastic-ascent model, and (ii) degenerate improving updates, where many random perturbations share similar components along these directions. Using ES as a geometric probe on fine-tuning reward landscapes of GSM8K, ARC-C, and WinoGrande across Qwen2.5-Instruct models (0.5B--7B), we show that reward-improving perturbations remain empirically accessible with small populations across scales. Together, these results reconcile ES scalability with non-monotonic training dynamics and suggest that high-dimensional fine-tuning may admit a broader class of viable optimization methods than worst-case theory implies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08ES\uff09\u80fd\u7528\u5c0f\u79cd\u7fa4\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14ES\u548cGRPO\u5956\u52b1\u6709\u5148\u5347\u540e\u964d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u6e90\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u4f4e\u66f2\u7387\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c0f\u79cd\u7fa4\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u5956\u52b1\u6539\u8fdb\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u7528\u5c0f\u79cd\u7fa4\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caES\u548cGRPO\u5956\u52b1\u5148\u5347\u540e\u964d\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u7528ES\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u63a2\u9488\u7814\u7a76GSM8K\u3001ARC - C\u548cWinoGrande\u5728Qwen2.5 - Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff080.5B - 7B\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5956\u52b1\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u4e0a\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6539\u8fdb\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5c0f\u79cd\u7fa4\u4ecd\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u548c\u4e86ES\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7406\u8bba\u66f4\u591a\u3002"}}

Prevalent approaches address this by identifying a small coreset of items to approximate full-benchmark performance. However, existing methods must estimate a reliable item profile from response patterns across many source models, which becomes statistically unstable when the source pool is small. This dependency is particularly limiting for newly released benchmarks with minimal historical evaluation data. We argue that discrete correctness labels are a lossy view of the model's decision process and fail to capture information encoded in hidden states. To address this, we introduce REPCORE, which aligns heterogeneous hidden states into a unified latent space to construct representative coresets. Using these subsets for performance extrapolation, REPCORE achieves precise estimation accuracy with as few as ten source models. Experiments on five benchmarks and over 200 models show consistent gains over output-based baselines in ranking correlation and estimation accuracy. Spectral analysis further indicates that the aligned representations contain separable components reflecting broad response tendencies and task-specific reasoning patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREPCORE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5c11\u6216\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u79bb\u6563\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165REPCORE\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c200\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cREPCORE\u5728\u6392\u540d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\u5305\u542b\u53cd\u6620\u5e7f\u6cdb\u54cd\u5e94\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "REPCORE\u80fd\u4ee5\u5c11\u81f3\u5341\u4e2a\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce GASP (Guided Adversarial Self-Play), a robustification method that explicitly trains detect-and-repair capabilities using only outcome verification. Without human labels or external teachers, GASP forms an adversarial self-play game within a single model: a polluter learns to induce failure via locally coherent corruptions, while an agent learns to diagnose and recover under the same corrupted conditioning. To address the scarcity of successful recoveries early in training, we propose in-distribution repair guidance, an imitation term on self-generated repairs that increases recovery probability while preserving previously acquired capabilities.

Automotive manufacturers use Boolean combinations of these codes, called error patterns (EPs), to characterize system faults and ensure vehicle safety. Yet, EP rules are still manually handcrafted by domain experts, a process that is expensive and prone to errors as vehicle complexity grows. This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations. By uniting practical causal discovery and agent-based reasoning, CAREP represents a step toward fully automated fault diagnostics, enabling scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient vehicle maintenance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfCAREP\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u4eceDTC\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210EP\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684EP\u89c4\u5219\u7531\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8f66\u8f86\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAREP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4eceDTC\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210EP\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6c7d\u8f66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCAREP\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u51c6\u786e\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u77e5EP\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "CAREP\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002"}}

In general, data-driven methods such as those based on deep learning, exhibit higher accuracy than traditional knowledge-based systems. These systems however, are not without significant limitations. The need for large labeled data sets, a lack of generalizibility to new environments (out-of-distribution generalization), and a lack of transparency at inference time are some of the obstacles to adoption in real world environments. In contrast, traditional approaches based on domain expertise in the form of rules, logic or first principles suffer from poor accuracy, many false positives and a need for ongoing expert supervision and manual tuning. While the majority of approaches in recent literature utilize some form of data-driven architecture, there are hybrid systems which also take into account domain specific knowledge. Such hybrid systems have the potential to overcome the weaknesses of either approach on its own while preserving their strengths. We propose taking the hybrid approach even further and integrating deep learning with symbolic logic, or Neuro-symbolic AI, to create more accurate, explainable, interpretable, and robust systems. We describe several neuro-symbolic architectures and examine their strengths and limitations within the PdM domain. We focus specifically on methods which involve the use of sensor data and manually crafted rules as inputs by describing concrete NeSy architectures. In short, this survey outlines the context of modern maintenance, defines key concepts, establishes a generalized framework, reviews current modeling approaches and challenges, and introduces the proposed focus on Neuro-symbolic AI (NESY).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e94\u5e74\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\uff08PdM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u76f8\u5173\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u6982\u8ff0\u73b0\u4ee3\u7ef4\u62a4\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PdM\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\uff08NESY\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PdM\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684PdM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning.

Existing approaches typically rely on table linearization or normalized grid modeling. However, these representations struggle to explicitly capture hierarchical structures and cross-dimensional dependencies, which can lead to misalignment between structural semantics and textual representations for non-standard tables. To address this issue, we propose an Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition (OHD) framework that constructs structure-preserving input representations of complex tables for LLMs. OHD introduces an Orthogonal Tree Induction (OTI) method based on spatial--semantic co-constraints, which decomposes irregular tables into a column tree and a row tree to capture vertical and horizontal hierarchical dependencies, respectively. Building on this representation, we design a dual-pathway association protocol to symmetrically reconstruct semantic lineage of each cell, and incorporate an LLM as a semantic arbitrator to align multi-level semantic information. We evaluate OHD framework on two complex table question answering benchmarks, AITQA and HiTab.

Existing infinite-horizon methods, which often rely on discounted contraction, do not naturally account for this fixed-horizon structure. We introduce a modified Q-function: rather than targeting the full-horizon, we learn a K-step lookahead Q-function that truncates planning to the next K steps. To further improve sample efficiency, we introduce a thresholding mechanism: actions are selected only when their estimated K-step lookahead value exceeds a time-varying threshold. We provide an efficient tabular learning algorithm for this novel objective, proving it achieves fast finite-sample convergence: it achieves minimax optimal constant regret for $K=1$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\max((K-1),C_{K-1})\\sqrt{SAT\\log(T)})$ regret for any $K \\geq 2$. We numerically evaluate the performance of our algorithm under the objective of maximizing reward.

Local linear methods for generating explanations, such as LIME and SHAP, have been criticized for being unstable near decision boundaries. In this paper, we explain that such concerns reflect a misunderstanding of the problem. The forecast uncertainty is high at decision boundaries, so consequently, the explanatory instability is high. The correct approach is to change the sequence of events and questions being asked. Nonlinear models can be highly predictive in some regions while having little or no predictability in others. Therefore, the first question is whether a usable forecast exists. When there is a forecast with low enough uncertainty to be useful, an explanation can be sought via a local linear approximation. In such cases, the explanatory instability is correspondingly low. When no usable forecast exists, the decision must fall to a simpler overall model such as traditional logistic regression. Additionally, these results show that some methods that purport to be explainable everywhere, such as ReLU networks or any piecewise linear model, have only an illusory explainability, because the forecast uncertainty at the segment boundaries is too high to be useful. Explaining an unusable forecast is pointless.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u662f\u56e0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e94\u5148\u5224\u65ad\u6709\u65e0\u53ef\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u518d\u5bfb\u6c42\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u53f7\u79f0\u5904\u5904\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u662f\u865a\u5e7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5148\u5224\u65ad\u6709\u65e0\u53ef\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u662f\u56e0\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\uff1b\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f4e\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u53f7\u79f0\u5904\u5904\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u662f\u865a\u5e7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u6539\u53d8\u83b7\u53d6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5148\u5224\u65ad\u6709\u65e0\u53ef\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods.

The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework. The approach provides AI-ready simulation data, supports emerging agentic AI workflows, and establishes a generalizable blueprint for knowledge-based mechanical and thermodynamic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bAI\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u62df\u5efa\u7acb\u84dd\u56fe", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4f9d\u8d56\u788e\u7247\u5316\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6eaf\u6e90\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u6eaf\u6e90\u548c\u7b26\u5408FAIR\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u51fa", "result": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6db5\u76d6\u5173\u952e\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784 - \u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u548c\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u590d\u7528", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9bAI\u53ef\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u5174\u4ee3\u7406AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u7528\u84dd\u56fe"}}

However, as the environment evolves during VLA execution, the optimal sparsity patterns change accordingly. Static pruning lacks the adaptability required for environment dynamics, whereas fixed-interval dynamic layer pruning suffers from coarse granularity and high retraining overheads. To bridge this gap, we propose EcoVLA, a training-free, plug-and-play adaptive pruning framework that supports orthogonal combination with existing VLA acceleration methods. EcoVLA comprises two components: Environment-aware Adaptive Pruning (EAP) and Interleaved Inference Orchestration ($I^2O$). EAP is a lightweight adaptive channel pruning method that incorporates the temporal consistency of the physical environment to update sparsity patterns. $I^2O$ leverages the FLOPs bubbles inherent in VLA inference to schedule the pruning method in parallel, ensuring negligible impact on latency. Evaluated on diverse VLA models and benchmarks, EcoVLA delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 1.60$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.4% drop in success rate, and further reaches 2.18$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.5% degradation when combined with token pruning.

While its impact has been extensively studied under the asymptotic regimes -- both in training time and FLS -- existing theory offers limited insight into how FLS affects generalization in practical settings, such as when training is stopped upon reaching a target training risk. In this work, we investigate the impact of FLS on generalization in deep networks under such practical conditions. Through empirical studies, we first uncover the emergence of an $\\textit{optimal FLS}$ -- neither too small nor too large -- that yields substantial generalization gains. This finding runs counter to the prevailing intuition that stronger feature learning universally improves generalization. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics in two-layer ReLU nets trained with logistic loss, where FLS is controlled via initialization scale. Our main theoretical result establishes the existence of an optimal FLS arising from a trade-off between two competing effects: An excessively large FLS induces an $\\textit{over-alignment}$ phenomenon that degrades generalization, while an overly small FLS leads to $\\textit{over-fitting}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08FLS\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18FLS\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u89c9\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9FLS\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18FLS\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u5c42ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18FLS\uff0c\u8fc7\u5927\u7684FLS\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u73b0\u8c61\u964d\u4f4e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u8fc7\u5c0f\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u8d8a\u5f3a\u8d8a\u597d\u3002"}}

Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

In contrast, real-world software development is organized as a collaborative activity carried out by teams following shared methodologies, with clear role separation, communication, and review. In this work, we present a fully automated multi-agent system that explicitly models software engineering as an organizational process, replicating the structure of an engineering team. Built on top of agyn, an open-source platform for configuring agent teams, our system assigns specialized agents to roles such as coordination, research, implementation, and review, provides them with isolated sandboxes for experimentation, and enables structured communication. The system follows a defined development methodology for working on issues, including analysis, task specification, pull request creation, and iterative review, and operates without any human intervention.

However, these successes have not translated to complex domains where the cost of interaction is high, such as the physical cost of running robots, the time cost of ML engineering, and the resource cost of scientific experiments. The true bottleneck for achieving the next level of agent performance for these complex and high-cost domains lies in the expense of executing actions to acquire reward signals. To address this gap, this paper argues that we should use world models as an intermediary between agents and the real world. We discuss how world models, viewed as models of dynamics, rewards, and task distributions, can overcome fundamental barriers of high-cost actions such as extreme off-policy learning and sample inefficiency in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how world models can provide critical and rich learning signals to agents across a broad set of domains, including machine learning engineering, computer use, robotics, and AI for science.

To address this, we propose MinPV (\\textbf{Min}imum \\textbf{P}ath \\textbf{V}ariance) Principle, which introduces a principled heuristic to minimize the overlooked path variance. Our key contribution is the derivation of a closed-form expression for the variance, turning an intractable problem into a tractable optimization.

In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

However, in real-world scenarios, the availability of modality data is often dynamic and uncertain, leading to substantial performance fluctuations due to the distribution shifts and semantic deficiencies of the incomplete multimodal inputs. Known as the missing modality issue, this challenge poses a critical barrier to the robustness and practical deployment of MAC models. To systematically quantify this issue, we introduce MissMAC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to establish fair and unified evaluation standards from the perspective of cross-modal synergy. Two guiding principles are proposed, including no missing prior during training, and one single model capable of handling both complete and incomplete modality scenarios, thereby ensuring better generalization. Moreover, to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications, our benchmark integrates evaluation protocols with both fixed and random missing patterns at the dataset and instance levels.

While prior efforts have explored empirical remedies, a theoretical understanding of such performance disparities in classification remains limited. In this work, we present Margin Regularization for Performance Disparity Reduction (MR$^2$), a theoretically principled regularization for classification by dynamically adjusting margins in both the logit and representation spaces. Our analysis establishes a margin-based, class-sensitive generalization bound that reveals how per-class feature variability contributes to error, motivating the use of larger margins for hard classes. Guided by this insight, MR$^2$ optimizes per-class logit margins proportional to feature spread and penalizes excessive representation margins to enhance intra-class compactness. Experiments on seven datasets, including ImageNet, and diverse pre-trained backbones (MAE, MoCov2, CLIP) demonstrate that MR$^2$ not only improves overall accuracy but also significantly boosts hard class performance without trading off easy classes, thus reducing performance disparity.

Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4ee5\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMLLMs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u51fa\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6210\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800c\u6587\u672c\u8303\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9MLLMs\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "MLLMs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7406\u89e3\u7ecf\u5927\u5e45\u6807\u8bb0\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b08\u500d\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u6cd5\u9ad8\u4eae\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u5b8c\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801\u514b\u9686\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u6297\u6027\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51faMLLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Despite its promise, RLVR remains prohibitively resource-intensive, requiring extensive reward signals and incurring substantial rollout costs during training. In this work, we revisit the fundamental question of data and compute efficiency in RLVR. We first establish a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity required to unlock reasoning capabilities, and empirically validate that strong performance can be achieved with a surprisingly small number of training instances. To tackle the computational burden, we propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), an uncertainty-aware RL strategy that dynamically selects a single informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-driven acquisition. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while preserving competitive reasoning accuracy, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for LLM post-training.

Ensemble methods are often adopted to mitigate these challenges by combining multiple detectors, which can reduce individual biases and increase robustness. Yet building an ensemble that is genuinely complementary remains challenging, since many detectors rely on similar decision cues and end up producing redundant anomaly scores. As a result, the potential of ensemble learning is often limited by the difficulty of identifying models that truly capture different types of irregularities. To address this, we propose a methodology for characterizing anomaly detectors through their decision mechanisms. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we quantify how each model attributes importance to input features, and we use these attribution profiles to measure similarity between detectors. We show that detectors with similar explanations tend to produce correlated anomaly scores and identify largely overlapping anomalies. Conversely, explanation divergence reliably indicates complementary detection behavior. Our results demonstrate that explanation-driven metrics offer a different criterion than raw outputs for selecting models in an ensemble. However, we also demonstrate that diversity alone is insufficient; high individual model performance remains a prerequisite for effective ensembles. By explicitly targeting explanation diversity while maintaining model quality, we are able to construct ensembles that are more diverse, more complementary, and ultimately more effective for unsupervised anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u8868\u5f81\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528SHapley Additive exPlanations\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u8bb8\u591a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u4f3c\u51b3\u7b56\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u5f97\u5206\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u8868\u5f81\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SHapley Additive exPlanations\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f52\u56e0\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8861\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u91ca\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5f97\u5206\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u5f02\u5219\u8868\u660e\u68c0\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff1b\u89e3\u91ca\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u4ec5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e2a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u662f\u6709\u6548\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u3001\u66f4\u4e92\u8865\u4e14\u6700\u7ec8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce the Canonical Intermediate Representation (CIR): a schema that LLMs explicitly generate between problem descriptions and optimization models. CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work. Extensive experiments show that R2C achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed benchmark (47.2% Accuracy Rate).

Theoretically, we redefine information gain as uncertainty reduction over the model's belief states, establishing guarantees, including non-negativity, telescoping additivity, and channel monotonicity. Practically, to enable scalable optimization without manual retrieval annotations, we propose an output-aware intrinsic estimator that computes information gain directly from the model's output distributions using semantic clustering via bidirectional textual entailment. This intrinsic reward guides the policy to maximize epistemic progress, enabling efficient training via Group Relative Policy Optimxization (GRPO).

To address these challenges, we reformulate conformal inference in a multiplicative filtering setting, modeling factuality as a product of claim-level scores. Our method, Multi-LLM Adaptive Conformal Inference (MACI), leverages ensembles to produce more accurate factuality-scores, which in our experiments led to higher retention, while validity is preserved through group-conditional calibration.

To better understand LLM scaling, we study representational differences between LLMs and their smaller counterparts, with the goal of replicating the representational qualities of larger models in the smaller models. We observe a geometric phenomenon which we term $\\textbf{embedding condensation}$, where token embeddings collapse into a narrow cone-like subspace in some language models. Through systematic analyses across multiple Transformer families, we show that small models such as $\\texttt{GPT2}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-0.6B}$ exhibit severe condensation, whereas the larger models such as $\\texttt{GPT2-xl}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-32B}$ are more resistant to this phenomenon. Additional observations show that embedding condensation is not reliably mitigated by knowledge distillation from larger models. To fight against it, we formulate a dispersion loss that explicitly encourages embedding dispersion during training.

We introduce a behavior-centered evaluation framework that distinguishes between persuasion applied during or prior to task execution.

To formalize this, we define the Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) as the minimum comprehension required to preserve oversight, autonomy, and accountable participation under AI assistance. CIT does not require full reasoning reconstruction, nor does it constrain automation. It identifies the threshold beyond which oversight becomes procedural and contestability fails. We operatinalize CIT through three functional dimensions: (i) verification capacity, (ii) comprehension-preserving interaction, and (iii) institutional scaffolds for governance.

RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite.

Among various approaches, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has become a particularly important framework, enabling iterative generation, evaluation, rejection, and resampling of intermediate reasoning trajectories.

All deployed systems rely on approximate reward models, raising a fundamental question: Why and when do approximate reward models suffice for effective inference-time scaling? In this work, we provide a theoretical answer. We identify the Bellman error of the approximate reward model as the key quantity governing the effectiveness of SMC-based inference-time scaling. For a reasoning process of length $T$, we show that if the Bellman error of the approximate reward model is bounded by $O(1/T)$, then combining this reward model with SMC reduces the computational complexity of reasoning from exponential in $T$ to polynomial in $T$.

While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty.

In this work, we provide an elegant and fundamental justification for paired sampling: we prove that the Shapley value depends exclusively on the odd component of the set function, and that paired sampling orthogonalizes the regression objective to filter out the irrelevant even component. Leveraging this insight, we propose OddSHAP, a novel consistent estimator that performs polynomial regression solely on the odd subspace. By utilizing the Fourier basis to isolate this subspace and employing a proxy model to identify high-impact interactions, OddSHAP overcomes the combinatorial explosion of higher-order approximations. Through an extensive benchmark evaluation, we find that OddSHAP achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9Shapley\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u914d\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668OddSHAP\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "Shapley\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u867d\u5229\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u8bc1\u660eShapley\u503c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5947\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u914d\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u5076\u5206\u91cf\uff1b\u63d0\u51faOddSHAP\uff0c\u5728\u5947\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57fa\u5206\u79bb\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cOddSHAP\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u914d\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684OddSHAP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSELF - THOUGHT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7ec6\u5316\u524d\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u505c\u7559\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u6279\u5224\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSELF - THOUGHT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u518d\u6307\u5bfc\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u677f\u53ef\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSELF - THOUGHT\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SELF - THOUGHT\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u7ea0\u9519\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce SafeGround, an uncertainty-aware framework for GUI grounding models that enables risk-aware predictions through calibrations before testing. SafeGround leverages a distribution-aware uncertainty quantification method to capture the spatial dispersion of stochastic samples from outputs of any given model. Then, through the calibration process, SafeGround derives a test-time decision threshold with statistically guaranteed false discovery rate (FDR) control. We apply SafeGround on multiple GUI grounding models for the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Experimental results show that our uncertainty measure consistently outperforms existing baselines in distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions, while the calibrated threshold reliably enables rigorous risk control and potentials of substantial system-level accuracy improvements.

To address this issue, a class of regularization methods that enforce consistency between imputed and fully observed data has emerged as a promising approach for improving model generalization, particularly in partially observed settings. We refer to this class of methods as Measure Consistency Regularization (MCR). Despite its empirical success in various applications, such as image inpainting, data imputation and semi-supervised learning, a fundamental understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of MCR remains limited. This paper bridges this gap by offering theoretical insights into why, when, and how MCR enhances imputation quality under partial observability, viewed through the lens of neural network distance.\n  Our theoretical analysis identifies the term responsible for MCR's generalization advantage and extends to the imperfect training regime, demonstrating that this advantage is not always guaranteed. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel training protocol that monitors the duality gap to determine an early stopping point that preserves the generalization benefit. We then provide detailed empirical evidence to support our theoretical claims and to show the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed stopping condition.

Grounded in classical theories of communication, \\textbf{Drift-Bench} provides a unified taxonomy of cooperative breakdowns and employs a persona-driven user simulator with the \\textbf{Rise} evaluation protocol. Experiments show substantial performance drops under these faults, with clarification effectiveness varying across user personas and fault types. \\MethodName bridges clarification research and agent safety evaluation, enabling systematic diagnosis of failures that can lead to unsafe executions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6Drift - Bench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u5165\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7406\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u8fde\u63a5\u6f84\u6e05\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u5408\u4f5c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6267\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Drift - Bench\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u4f5c\u6545\u969c\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cRise\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u5f02", "conclusion": "Drift - Bench\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u6f84\u6e05\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6545\u969c"}}

Annealed Langevin dynamics (ALD) is a widely used alternative to classical Langevin since it often yields much faster mixing on multimodal targets, but there is still a gap between this empirical success and existing theory: when, and under which design choices, can ALD be guaranteed to remain stable as dimension increases? In this paper, we help bridge this gap by providing a uniform-in-dimension analysis of continuous-time ALD for multimodal targets that can be well-approximated by Gaussian mixture models. Along an explicit annealing path obtained by progressively removing Gaussian smoothing of the target, we identify sufficient spectral conditions - linking smoothing covariance and the covariances of the Gaussian components of the mixture - under which ALD achieves a prescribed accuracy within a single, dimension-uniform time horizon. We then establish dimension-robustness to imperfect initialization and score approximation: under a misspecified-mixture score model, we derive explicit conditions showing that preconditioning the ALD algorithm with a sufficiently decaying spectrum is necessary to prevent error terms from accumulating across coordinates and destroying dimension-uniform control.

In an effort to improve performance, a gated attention model that leverages a gating mechanism within the multi-head self-attention has recently been proposed as a promising alternative. Gated attention has been empirically demonstrated to increase the expressiveness of low-rank mapping in standard attention and even to eliminate the attention sink phenomenon. Despite its efficacy, a clear theoretical understanding of gated attention's benefits remains lacking in the literature. To close this gap, we rigorously show that each entry in a gated attention matrix or a multi-head self-attention matrix can be written as a hierarchical mixture of experts. By recasting learning as an expert estimation problem, we demonstrate that gated attention is more sample-efficient than multi-head self-attention. In particular, while the former needs only a polynomial number of data points to estimate an expert, the latter requires exponentially many data points to achieve the same estimation error. Furthermore, our analysis also provides a theoretical justification for why gated attention yields higher performance when a gate is placed at the output of the scaled dot product attention or the value map rather than at other positions in the multi-head self-attention architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8bc1\u660e\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u53ef\u5199\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6bd4\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66f4\u5177\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u94f8\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6bd4\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66f4\u5177\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ea\u9700\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u9700\u6307\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Yu"], "title": "From Observations to States: Latent Time Series Forecasting", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning has achieved strong performance in Time Series Forecasting (TSF). However, we identify a critical representation paradox, termed Latent Chaos: models with accurate predictions often learn latent representations that are temporally disordered and lack continuity. We attribute this phenomenon to the dominant observation-space forecasting paradigm. Most TSF models minimize point-wise errors on noisy and partially observed data, which encourages shortcut solutions instead of the recovery of underlying system dynamics. To address this issue, we propose Latent Time Series Forecasting (LatentTSF), a novel paradigm that shifts TSF from observation regression to latent state prediction. Specifically, LatentTSF employs an AutoEncoder to project observations at each time step into a higher-dimensional latent state space. This expanded representation aims to capture underlying system variables and impose a smoother temporal structure. Forecasting is then performed entirely in the latent space, allowing the model to focus on learning structured temporal dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed latent objectives implicitly maximize mutual information between predicted latent states and ground-truth states and observations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks confirm that LatentTSF effectively mitigates latent chaos, achieving superior performance.

For multi-step, state-dependent analytical tasks, this is a mistake. Building on Woods (1984) Keyhole Effect, the cognitive cost of viewing large information spaces through narrow viewports, I show that chat interfaces systematically degrade analytical performance through five mechanisms: (1) constant content displacement defeats hippocampal spatial memory systems; (2) hidden state variables exceed working memory capacity (approximately 4 chunks under load); (3) forced verbalization triggers verbal overshadowing, degrading visual pattern recognition; (4) linear text streams block epistemic action and cognitive offloading; (5) serialization penalties scale with data dimensionality. I formalize cognitive overload as O = max(0, m - v - W) where m is task-relevant items, v is visible items, and W is working memory capacity. When O > 0, error probability increases and analytical biases (anchoring, confirmation, change blindness) amplify. Eight hybrid design patterns address these failures: Generative UI, Infinite Canvas, Deictic Interaction, State Rail, Ghost Layers, Mise en Place, Semantic Zoom, and Probabilistic UI. Each pattern targets specific cognitive bottlenecks while preserving natural language for intent specification and synthesis. Well-scaffolded conversational systems that encode expert priors may reduce load for guided tasks; the framework applies most strongly to open-ended exploration.

We release MindGuard-testset, a dataset of real-world multi-turn conversations annotated at the turn level by clinical experts.

Though the straight-forward ''best-of-$N$'' (BoN) strategy has already demonstrated significant improvements in performance, it lacks principled guidance on the choice of $N$, budget allocation, and multi-stage decision-making, thereby leaving substantial room for optimization. While many works have explored such optimization, rigorous theoretical guarantees remain limited. In this work, we propose new methodologies to predict and improve scaling properties via tail-guided search. By estimating the tail distribution of rewards, our method predicts the scaling law of LLMs without the need for exhaustive evaluations. Leveraging this prediction tool, we introduce Scaling-Law Guided (SLG) Search, a new test-time algorithm that dynamically allocates compute to identify and exploit intermediate states with the highest predicted potential. We theoretically prove that SLG achieves vanishing regret compared to perfect-information oracles, and achieves expected rewards that would otherwise require a polynomially larger compute budget required when using BoN. Empirically, we validate our framework across different LLMs and reward models, confirming that tail-guided allocation consistently achieves higher reward yields than Best-of-$N$ under identical compute budgets.

We investigate two agent variants: (1) a Nonadaptive agent that stops execution if it finds itself in violation of \\D~ and (2) an Adaptive agent that, in the same situation, instead modifies its HTN plan to search for alternative ways to achieve its given task. We present R-HTN (for: Rebellious-HTN), a general algorithm for online HTN planning under directives \\D. We evaluate R-HTN in two task domains where the agent must not violate some directives for safety reasons or as dictated by their personality traits.

Standard benchmarks cannot answer this because they lack access to the true posterior p(y|x). We use class-conditional normalizing flows as oracles that make exact posteriors tractable on realistic images (AFHQ, ImageNet). This enables five lines of investigation. Scaling laws: Prediction error decomposes into irreducible aleatoric uncertainty and reducible epistemic error; the epistemic component follows a power law in dataset size, continuing to shrink even when total loss plateaus. Limits of learning: The aleatoric floor is exactly measurable, and architectures differ markedly in how they approach it: ResNets exhibit clean power-law scaling while Vision Transformers stall in low-data regimes. Soft labels: Oracle posteriors contain learnable structure beyond class labels: training with exact posteriors outperforms hard labels and yields near-perfect calibration.

A common heuristic treats small-margin (ambiguous) pairs as noisy and filters them out. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and show that pair difficulty interacts strongly with the optimization objective: when trained with preference-based losses, difficult pairs can destabilize training and harm alignment, yet these same pairs still contain useful supervision signals when optimized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose MixDPO, a simple yet effective difficulty-aware training strategy that (i) orders preference data from easy to hard (a curriculum over margin-defined difficulty), and (ii) routes difficult pairs to an SFT objective while applying a preference loss to easy pairs. This hybrid design provides a practical mechanism to leverage ambiguous pairs without incurring the optimization failures often associated with preference losses on low-margin data.

To address this threat, modern bot detectors increasingly rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the effectiveness of these GNN-based detectors in real-world settings remains poorly understood. In practice, attackers continuously adapt their strategies as well as must operate under domain-specific and temporal constraints, which can fundamentally limit the applicability of existing attack methods. As a result, there is a critical need for robust GNN-based bot detection methods under realistic, constraint-aware attack scenarios.\n  To address this gap, we introduce BOCLOAK to systematically evaluate the robustness of GNN-based social bot detection via both edge editing and node injection adversarial attacks under realistic constraints. BOCLOAK constructs a probability measure over spatio-temporal neighbor features and learns an optimal transport geometry that separates human and bot behaviors. It then decodes transport plans into sparse, plausible edge edits that evade detection while obeying real-world constraints. We evaluate BOCLOAK across three social bot datasets, five state-of-the-art bot detectors, three adversarial defenses, and compare it against four leading graph adversarial attack baselines. BOCLOAK achieves up to 80.13% higher attack success rates while using 99.80% less GPU memory under realistic real-world constraints.

Most existing ARL methods train a single shared model parameters to support both reasoning and tool use behaviors, implicitly assuming that joint training leads to improved overall agent performance. Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm. To address this issue, we propose Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning(DART), a simple and efficient framework that explicitly decouples parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use via separate low-rank adaptation modules.

While recent \"In-Run\" methods bypass the prohibitive cost of retraining by estimating contributions dynamically, they heavily rely on the linear structure of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and fail to capture the complex dynamics of adaptive optimizers like Adam. In this work, we demonstrate that data attribution is inherently optimizer-dependent: we show that SGD-based proxies diverge significantly from true contributions under Adam (Pearson $R \\approx 0.11$), rendering them ineffective for modern training pipelines. To bridge this gap, we propose Adam-Aware In-Run Data Shapley. We derive a closed-form approximation that restores additivity by redefining utility under a fixed-state assumption and enable scalable computation via a novel Linearized Ghost Approximation.

We present a formal analysis of how alignment from human feedback can increase this failure mode by identifying an explicit amplification mechanism that causally links optimization against a learned reward to bias in the human preference data used for alignment. We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty.

Prototype-based XAI methods offer an intrinsically interpretable alternative to post-hoc approaches which often yield inconsistent explanations. Prototype-based XAI methods make predictions based on the similarity between inputs and learned prototypes that represent typical characteristics of target classes. However, existing prototype-based models are primarily designed for standard RGB image data and are not optimized for the distinct, variable-specific channels commonly found in geoscientific image and raster datasets. In this study, we develop a prototype-based XAI approach tailored for multi-channel geospatial data, where each channel represents a distinct physical environmental variable or spectral channel. Our approach enables the model to identify separate, channel-specific prototypical characteristics sourced from multiple distinct training examples that inform how these features individually and in combination influence model prediction while achieving comparable performance to standard neural networks. We demonstrate this method through two geoscientific case studies: (1) classification of Madden Julian Oscillation phases using multi-variable climate data and (2) land-use classification from multispectral satellite imagery. This approach produces both local (instance-level) and global (model-level) explanations for providing insights into feature-relevance across channels.

Yet, existing steering methods are remarkably brittle, with seemingly non-steerable concepts becoming completely steerable based on subtle algorithmic choices in how concept-related features are extracted. In this work, we introduce an attention-guided steering framework that overcomes three core challenges associated with steering: (1) automatic selection of relevant token embeddings for extracting concept-related features; (2) accounting for heterogeneity of concept-related features across LLM activations; and (3) identification of layers most relevant for steering.

In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p>=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance.

Building on this, we then develop an offline algorithm based on pessimistic value iteration that includes: (i) per-site ridge regression for Bellman targets, (ii) feature-wise worst-case (row-wise minimization) aggregation, and (iii) a data-dependent pessimism penalty computed from the diagonals of the inverse design matrices. We further propose a cluster-level extension that pools similar sites to improve sample efficiency, guided by prior knowledge of site similarity. Under a robust partial coverage assumption, we prove a suboptimality bound for the resulting policy. Overall, our framework addresses multi-site learning with heterogeneous data sources and provides a principled approach to robust planning without relying on strong state-action rectangularity assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2MDPs\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u5171\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u7ec4\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2MDPs\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u60b2\u89c2\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u7fa4\u7ea7\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u90e8\u5206\u8986\u76d6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u5f97\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u72b6\u6001 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u77e9\u5f62\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Motivated by these limitations, we study generative inference models guided by a unified reward function capturing core AP deployment objectives across diverse floorplans.

The diffusion process progressively improves sampling by smoothing and sharpening the reward landscape, rather than relying on iterative refinement, which is effective for non-convex and fragmented objectives.

In this work, we experiment with finding the sentiments of image and text data, individually and in combination, on two datasets. Part of the approach introduces the novel `Textual-Cues for Enhancing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis' (TEMSA) based on object recognition methods to address the difficulties in multimodal sentiment analysis.

This mechanism allows the design policy to expand or compress regions of the input space in response to observed variability, thereby shaping the behavior of variance-based acquisition functions.

To this end, we propose Quantum Generator Kernels (QGKs), a generator-based approach to quantum kernels, comprising a set of Variational Generator Groups (VGGs) that merge universal generators into a parameterizable operator, ensuring scalable coverage of the available quantum space. Thereby, we address shortcomings of current leading strategies employing hybrid architectures, which might prevent exploiting quantum computing's full potential due to fixed intermediate embedding processes. To optimize the kernel alignment to the target domain, we train a weight vector to parameterize the projection of the VGGs in the current data context.

We quantify MDP complexity using a first-order quantity and several new data-dependent measures for the adversarial regime, including a second-order quantity and a path-length measure, as well as variance-based measures for the stochastic regime. To adapt to these measures, we develop algorithms based on global optimization and policy optimization, both built on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with log-barrier regularization. For global optimization, our algorithms achieve first-order, second-order, and path-length regret bounds in the adversarial regime, and in the stochastic regime, they achieve a variance-aware gap-independent bound and a variance-aware gap-dependent bound that is polylogarithmic in the number of episodes. For policy optimization, our algorithms achieve the same data- and variance-dependent adaptivity, up to a factor of the episode horizon, by exploiting a new optimistic $Q$-function estimator. Finally, we establish regret lower bounds in terms of data-dependent complexity measures for the adversarial regime and a variance measure for the stochastic regime, implying that the regret upper bounds achieved by the global-optimization approach are nearly optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u60c5\u8282\u8868\u683c\u578b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u548c\u968f\u673a\u573a\u666f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u6094\u6068\u754c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6094\u6068\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u60c5\u8282\u8868\u683c\u578b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u548c\u968f\u673a\u573a\u666f\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u4f18\u6094\u6068\u754c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e26\u5bf9\u6570\u969c\u788d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4e50\u89c2\u8ddf\u968f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u4e50\u89c2Q\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u6094\u6068\u754c\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u754c\uff1b\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e5f\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6094\u6068\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6094\u6068\u4e0a\u754c\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u3002"}}

The key insight is simple: instead of using an external teacher, the model teaches itself by matching its own probability distribution from before compression. This self-referential setup enables surprisingly strong quality recovery after aggressive pruning.\n  Our experiments reveal an unexpected finding: self-referential distillation alone, applied post-training under an identical objective and fixed calibration dataset, improves model quality by 39% relative to the original converged checkpoint. When combined with structured pruning, SparseKD achieves 15-65% parameter reduction with acceptable quality trade-offs. Kernel profiling shows that speedups arise entirely from reduced dense matrix multiplication in feed-forward layers while attention remains unchanged, making this approach complementary to attention optimizations.\n  We validate across two model families (0.6B and 3.8B parameters) with multi-seed experiments confirming high reproducibility.

We introduce MATRIX, a multimodal benchmark for materials science reasoning that evaluates foundational theory, research-level reasoning, and the interpretation of real experimental artifacts across multiple characterization modalities. Using MATRIX as a controlled diagnostic, we isolate the effect of visual grounding by comparing post-training on structured materials science text alone with post-training that incorporates paired experimental images. Despite using relatively small amounts of multimodal data, visual supervision improves experimental interpretation by 10-25% and yields 5-16% gains on text-only scientific reasoning tasks.

The proposed method enables the generation of missing design components based on a partial reference design while satisfying performance constraints, without retraining the underlying model. By applying mask-based resampling during inference process, RePaint allows efficient and controllable repainting of partial designs under both performance and parameter constraints, which is not supported by conventional DDPM-base methods.

Results show that the method achieves accuracy comparable to or better than pre-trained models while enabling controlled novelty through fixing partial designs.

In this work, we introduce a principled framework for understanding RLVR instability through the lens of objective-level hacking. Unlike reward hacking, which arises from exploitable verifiers, objective-level hacking emerges from token-level credit misalignment and is manifested as system-level spurious signals in the optimization objective. Grounded in our framework, together with extensive experiments on a 30B MoE model, we trace the origin and formalize the mechanism behind a key pathological training dynamic in MoE models: the abnormal growth of the training-inference discrepancy, a phenomenon widely associated with instability but previously lacking a mechanistic explanation.

We identify a simple yet effective failure mode, termed context nesting, where harmful requests are embedded within structured benign contexts, effectively bypassing the stepwise reduction mechanism.

This contextual data, crucial for domain experts to classify vehicle failures, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and the noisy nature of real-world data. This paper presents BiCarFormer: the first multimodal approach to multi-label sequence classification of error codes into error patterns that integrates DTC sequences and environmental conditions.

Experimental results on a challenging real-world automotive dataset with 22,137 error codes and 360 error patterns demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to models that rely solely on DTC sequences and traditional sequence models.

Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks.

We propose a geographic location encoder built from spherical Slepian functions that concentrate representational capacity inside a region-of-interest and scale to high resolutions without extensive computational demands.

However, the efficacy of such heterogeneous networks is often compromised by the conflict between limited onboard resources and stringent stability requirements. Moving beyond traditional throughput-centric designs, we propose a Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control closed-loop framework that explicitly models the impact of communication latency on physical control stability. To guarantee mission reliability, we leverage the Lyapunov stability theory to derive an intrinsic mapping between the state evolution of the control system and communication constraints, transforming abstract stability requirements into quantifiable resource boundaries. Then, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs (as leaders) dynamically price resources to balance load and ensure stability, while users (as followers) optimize requests based on service urgency. Furthermore, addressing the prohibitive computational overhead of standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on energy-constrained edge platforms, we propose a novel and lightweight pruning-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. By integrating a dynamic structured pruning mechanism, the proposed algorithm significantly compresses the neural network scale during training, enabling the UAV to rapidly approximate the game equilibrium with minimal inference latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively secures control loop stability while maximizing system utility in dynamic low-altitude environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2dUAV\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f20\u611f - \u901a\u4fe1 - \u8ba1\u7b97 - \u63a7\u5236\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3UAV\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u673a\u8f7d\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f20\u611f - \u901a\u4fe1 - \u8ba1\u7b97 - \u63a7\u5236\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Lyapunov\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5c06\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aStackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u526a\u679dPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4f4e\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u969c\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4f4e\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002"}}

We formalize learning a linear prediction under client-wise MCAR patterns and develop two modular approaches tailored to the dimensional regime and communication budget.

To address this, we introduce FastForward, a predictive sparsity framework that accelerates LLM prefill through block-wise, context-aware FFN sparsity. FastForward combines (1) a lightweight expert predictor to select high-importance neurons per block, (2) an error compensation network to correct sparsity-induced errors, and (3) a layer-wise sparsity scheduler to allocate compute based on token-mixing importance. Across LLaMA and Qwen models up to 8B parameters, FastForward delivers up to 1.45$\\times$ compute-bound speedup at 50% FFN sparsity with $<$ 6% accuracy loss compared to the dense baseline on LongBench, substantially reducing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) for efficient, long-context LLM inference on constrained hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFastForward\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u9996\u6b21\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709FFN\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e14\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FastForward\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5757\u7ea7\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684FFN\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA\u548cQwen\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c50% FFN\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b01.45\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e6%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9996\u6b21\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "FastForward\u80fd\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

This persistence of memories, e.g., the user is vegetarian, can enhance personalization in future conversations.

We identify two long-term memory-specific risks: cross-domain leakage, where LLMs inappropriately inject context from the long-term memories; and memory-induced sycophancy, where stored long-term memories insidiously reinforce user biases. We evaluate 18 frontier and open-source LLMs on our benchmark. Our results reveal a surprisingly high failure rate across these LLMs - a median failure rate of 53% on cross-domain samples and 97% on sycophancy samples.

In this setting, designing efficient no-swap regret translates to sublinear -- in horizon $T$ -- swap regret with polylogarithmic dependence on $N$. In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits. Our paper resolves this challenge, by introducing a no-swap-regret learning algorithm with regret that scales polylogarithmically in $N$ and is tight for the class of combinatorial bandits.

Current methods decompose activations into sparse linear features but discard geometric structure. We develop a theory for studying the geometric structre of features by analyzing the spectra (eigenvalues, eigenspaces, etc.) of weight derived matrices. In particular, we introduce the frame operator $F = WW^\\top$, which gives us a spectral measure that describes how each feature allocates norm across eigenspaces. While previous tools could describe the pairwise interactions between features, spectral methods capture the global geometry (``how do all features interact?''). In toy models of superposition, we use this theory to prove that capacity saturation forces spectral localization: features collapse onto single eigenspaces, organize into tight frames, and admit discrete classification via association schemes, classifying all geometries from prior work (simplices, polygons, antiprisms). The spectral measure formalism applies to arbitrary weight matrices, enabling diagnosis of feature localization beyond toy settings.

The resulting data are used to construct derived outcomes that act as proxies for scientific outcomes that are not directly observable. Although intra-subject processing is widely used, its impact on inter-subject statistical inference has not been systematically studied, and a principled framework for causal analysis in this setting is lacking. In this article, we propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with derived outcomes obtained after intra-subject processing. This framework applies to settings with a modular structure, where intra-subject analyses are conducted independently across subjects and are followed by inter-subject analyses based on parameters from the intra-subject stage. We develop multiply robust estimators of causal parameters under rate conditions on both intra-subject and inter-subject models, which allows the use of flexible machine learning. We specialize the framework to a mediation setting and focus on the natural direct effect. For high dimensional inference, we employ a step-down procedure that controls the exceedance rate of the false discovery proportion.

However, the standalone GNNs can unleash threat surfaces and privacy implications, as some sensitive graph-structured data is collected and processed in a centralized setting. To solve this issue, Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGNNs) are proposed to facilitate collaborative learning over decentralized local graph data, aiming to preserve user privacy. Yet, emerging research indicates that even in these settings, shared model updates, particularly gradients, can unintentionally leak sensitive information of local users. Numerous privacy inference attacks have been explored in traditional federated learning and extended to graph settings, but the problem of label distribution inference in FedGNNs remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fed-Listing (Federated Label Distribution Inference in GNNs), a novel gradient-based attack designed to infer the private label statistics of target clients in FedGNNs without access to raw data or node features. Fed-Listing only leverages the final-layer gradients exchanged during training to uncover statistical patterns that reveal class proportions in a stealthy manner. An auxiliary shadow dataset is used to generate diverse label partitioning strategies, simulating various client distributions, on which the attack model is obtained. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three GNN architectures show that Fed-Listing significantly outperforms existing baselines, including random guessing and Decaf, even under challenging non-i.i.d. scenarios.

Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%.

Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often face challenges such as non-stationarity during training and limited generalization to unseen problem instances because they optimize representation learning and policy execution simultaneously. To address these issues, we introduce variational inference to the JSSP domain for the first time and derive a probabilistic objective based on the Evidence of Lower Bound (ELBO) with maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By mathematically decoupling representation learning from policy optimization, the VG2S framework enables the agent to learn robust structural representations of scheduling instances through a variational graph encoder. This approach significantly enhances training stability and robustness against hyperparameter variations.

Existing studies usually enhance the reasoning efficiency of LLMs by compressing CoT sequences. However, this approach conflicts with test-time scaling, limiting the reasoning capacity of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an efficient reasoning framework that models the reasoning process of LLMs as a state-transition process. Specifically, we first apply a linear attention mechanism to estimate the LLM's reasoning state, which records the historical reasoning information from previous reasoning steps. Then, based on the query prompt and the reasoning state, the LLM can efficiently perform the current reasoning step and update the state. With the linear attention, each token in the current reasoning step can directly retrieve relevant historical reasoning information from the reasoning state, without explicitly attending to tokens in previous reasoning steps. In this way, the computational complexity of attention is reduced from quadratic to linear, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. In addition, we propose a state-based reasoning strategy to mitigate the over-thinking issue caused by noisy reasoning steps. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes demonstrate that our framework not only improves the reasoning efficiency of LLMs but also enhances their reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u94fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks.

(2004) introduced least angle regression (LAR) as an algorithm for linear predictions, intended as an alternative to forward selection with connections to penalized regression. However, LAR has remained somewhat of a \"black box,\" where some basic behavioral properties of LAR output are not well understood, including an appropriate termination point for the algorithm. We provide a novel framework for inference with LAR, which also allows LAR to be understood from new perspectives with several newly developed mathematical properties. The LAR algorithm at a data level can viewed as estimating a population counterpart \"path\" that organizes a response mean along regressor variables which are ordered according to a decreasing series of population \"correlation\" parameters; such parameters are shown to have meaningful interpretations for explaining variable contributions whereby zero correlations denote unimportant variables. In the output of LAR, estimates of all non-zero population correlations turn out to have independent normal distributions for use in inference, while estimates of zero-valued population correlations have a certain non-normal joint distribution. These properties help to provide a formal rule for stopping the LAR algorithm. While the standard bootstrap for regression can fail for LAR, a modified bootstrap provides a practical and formally justified tool for interpreting the entrance of variables and quantifying uncertainty in estimation.

We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score.

This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for the explainability of generative models, extending the Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations (SMILE) method to generative settings. gSMILE employs controlled perturbations of textual input, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted surrogate modelling to quantify and visualise how specific components of a prompt or instruction influence model outputs. Applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), gSMILE provides fine-grained token-level attribution and generates intuitive heatmaps that highlight influential tokens and reasoning pathways. In instruction-based image editing models, the exact text-perturbation mechanism is employed, allowing for the analysis of how modifications to an editing instruction impact the resulting image. Combined with a scenario-based evaluation strategy grounded in the Operational Design Domain (ODD) framework, gSMILE allows systematic assessment of model behaviour across diverse semantic and environmental conditions. To evaluate explanation quality, we define rigorous attribution metrics, including stability, fidelity, accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness, and apply them across multiple generative architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned attributions and generalises effectively across state-of-the-art generative models.

We propose Private Mask Pre-Training (PMP), a pre-training framework that concentrates representation learning into a sparse subnetwork identified early in training. The binary mask defining this subnetwork is kept private, and only the final dense weights are released. This forces unauthorized fine-tuning without access to the mask to update parameters misaligned with pretraining subspace, inducing an intrinsic mismatch between the fine-tuning objective and the pre-training geometry. We provide theoretical analysis showing that this mismatch destabilizes gradient-based adaptation and bounds fine-tuning gains.

In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency.

At the beginning of each episode, SIERL chooses a sub-goal from the \\textit{frontier} (the boundary of the agent's known state space), before the agent continues exploring toward the main task objective. The key contribution of our method is the sub-goal selection mechanism, which provides state-action pairs that are neither overly familiar nor completely novel. Thus, it assures that the frontier is expanded systematically and that the agent is capable of reaching any state within it. Inspired by search, sub-goals are prioritized from the frontier based on estimates of cost-to-come and cost-to-go, effectively steering exploration towards the most informative regions. In experiments on challenging sparse-reward environments, SIERL outperforms dominant baselines in both achieving the main task goal and generalizing to reach arbitrary states in the environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSIERL\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u6613\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIERL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u4ece\u524d\u6cbf\u9009\u62e9\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\u6210\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSIERL\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8fbe\u4efb\u610f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SIERL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

Exhaustive evaluation is often infeasible due to computational constraints and data limitations in few shot scenarios. Existing selection methods fail to fully address this: they either rely on data-intensive proxies or use symmetric textual descriptors that neglect the inherently directional and model-specific nature of transferability. To address this problem, we propose a framework that grounds model selection in the internal functional dynamics of the visual encoder. Our approach represents each task via layer wise conductance and derives a target-conditioned block importance distribution through entropy regularized alignment. Building on this, we introduce Directional Conductance Divergence (DCD), an asymmetric metric that quantifies how effectively a source task covers the target's salient functional blocks. This allows for predicting target model rankings by aggregating source task ranks without direct inference.

Previous work has shown that a linear classifier trained on a contrastive instruction pair and a simple dataset can achieve good performance. However, these probes exhibit notable failures even in straightforward scenarios, including spurious correlations and false positives on non-deceptive responses. In this paper, we identify the importance of the instruction pair used during training. Furthermore, we show that targeting specific deceptive behaviors through a human-interpretable taxonomy of deception leads to improved results on evaluation datasets. Our findings reveal that instruction pairs capture deceptive intent rather than content-specific patterns, explaining why prompt choice dominates probe performance (70.6% of variance).

In many practical settings, the graphical model remains fixed while inference must be performed repeatedly for varying evidence patterns. Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms scale to large models but rely on myopic best-improvement rule that prioritizes immediate likelihood gains and often stagnate in poor local optima. Heuristics such as Guided Local Search (GLS+) partially alleviate this limitation by modifying the search landscape, but their guidance cannot be reused effectively across multiple inference queries on the same model. We propose a neural amortization framework for improving local search in this repeated-query regime. Exploiting the fixed graph structure, we train an attention-based network to score local moves by predicting their ability to reduce Hamming distance to a near-optimal solution. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing local search procedures, using this signal to balance short-term likelihood gains with long-term promise during neighbor selection.

In softmax-based models, class regions are defined implicitly as solutions to systems of inequalities among logits, making them difficult to extract and visualize.

Unlike softmax, where class regions are defined implicitly through coupled inequalities among logits, each PUNN partition function $h_i$ directly defines the probability of class $i$ as a standalone function of $x$.\n  We prove that PUNN is dense in the space of continuous probability maps on compact domains.

In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language.

Many current systems rely on brittle heuristics or indiscriminate long reasoning, which offers little control over the benefit-burden tradeoff. We formulate the problem as cost-sensitive selective intervention and present PRISM, a novel framework that couples a decision-theoretic gate with a dual-process reasoning architecture. At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: \"make haste slowly\"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases. Training uses gate-aligned, schema-locked distillation: a teacher running the full PRISM pipeline provides dense, executable supervision on unlabeled interaction traces, while the student learns a response policy that is explicitly decoupled from the intervention gate to enable tunable and auditable control. On ProactiveBench, PRISM reduces false alarms by 22.78% and improves F1 by 20.14% over strong baselines.

While IIoT enables predictive maintenance and cross-site optimization of modern industrial control systems, such as those in manufacturing and energy, it also introduces significant privacy and confidentiality risks due to the sensitivity of operational data. Contrastive learning, a self-supervised representation learning paradigm, has recently emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving analytics by reducing reliance on labeled data and raw data sharing.

In electronic health records (EHRs), for example, medical events are grouped into a sequence of clinical encounters with well-defined temporal structure, but the order and timing of events within each encounter may be unknown or unreliable. Most existing foundation models (FMs) for event stream data flatten this hierarchy into a one-dimensional sequence, leading to (i) computational inefficiency associated with dense attention and learning spurious within-set relationships, and (ii) lower-quality set-level representations from heuristic post-training pooling for downstream tasks. Here, we show that preserving the original hierarchy in the FM architecture provides a useful inductive bias that improves both computational efficiency and representation quality. We then introduce Nested Event Stream Transformer (NEST), a FM for event streams comprised of sequences of multisets.

S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research. Experiments on authoritative scientific benchmarks involving long-horizon planning and complex specialized tool orchestration, including biomini-eval (biology), ChemBench (chemistry), and MatSciBench (material science), demonstrate that S1-NexusAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability in complex scientific tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u7814\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6S1 - NexusAgent\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301MCP\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u4ee3\u79d1\u7814\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS1 - NexusAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42Plan - and - CodeAct\u6267\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301MCP\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6709Critic Agent\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5f62\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u80fd\u95ed\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u6743\u5a01\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "S1 - NexusAgent\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u5f62\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6267\u884c\u524d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u8fdb\u98df\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u572820\u5929\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7d2f\u79ef\u65e0\u8fdb\u98df\u4e8b\u4ef6\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8560%\uff0c\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63d0\u5347AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We develop a framework clearly separating the underlying world, the data generation process and the resulting model representations to study these questions in a controlled setup. 5,075 city coordinates define the world and 7 geometric tasks generate the training data for autoregressive training. We find that different tasks give rise to qualitatively and quantitatively distinct world representation geometries. However, multi-task training drives convergence of world representations: models trained on non-overlapping tasks develop aligned geometric representations, providing controlled evidence for the Multitask Scaling Hypothesis of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. To study adaptation, we pretrain models on all tasks, then test whether new entities (cities) can be consistently integrated into the representation space via fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that despite multi-task pretraining, some tasks, which we call divergent, actively harm the representational integration of new entities and harm generalization.

We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation.

However, prevailing two-stage methods yield task-agnostic representations, decoupling them from downstream objectives. Recent prompt-based approaches attempt to fix this but introduce two challenges: they often lack explicit spatial priors, causing spatially incoherent inter-region modeling, and they lack robust mechanisms for explicit task-semantic alignment. We propose ToPT, a two-stage framework that delivers spatially consistent fusion and explicit task alignment. ToPT consists of two modules: spatial-aware region embedding learning (SREL) and task-aware prompting for region embeddings (Prompt4RE). SREL employs a Graphormer-based fusion module that injects spatial priors-distance and regional centrality-as learnable attention biases to capture coherent, interpretable inter-region interactions. Prompt4RE performs task-oriented prompting: a frozen multimodal large language model (MLLM) processes task-specific templates to obtain semantic vectors, which are aligned with region embeddings via multi-head cross-attention for stable task conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks and cities show state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 64.2\\%, validating the necessity and complementarity of spatial priors and prompt-region alignment.

RNNs and their variants suffer from vanishing gradients, and Transformers suffer from quadratic scaling.

Invertible Memory Flow Networks (IMFN) make long sequence compression tractable through factorization: instead of learning end-to-end compression, we decompose the problem into pairwise merges using a binary tree of \"sweeper\" modules. Rather than learning to compress long sequences, each sweeper learns a much simpler 2-to-1 compression task, achieving O(log N) depth with sublinear error accumulation in sequence length. For online inference, we distilled into a constant-cost recurrent student achieving O(1) sequential steps.

As experimental discovery is resource-intensive and time-consuming, efficient computational methodologies have become essential. The predominant paradigm formulates DDI prediction as a drug graph-based link prediction task. However, further progress is hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) lack of high-quality data: most studies rely on small-scale DDI datasets and single-modal drug representations; (2) lack of standardized evaluation: inconsistent scenarios, varied metrics, and diverse baselines. To address the above issues, we propose OpenDDI, a comprehensive benchmark for DDI prediction. Specifically, (1) from the data perspective, OpenDDI unifies 6 widely used DDI datasets and 2 existing forms of drug representation, while additionally contributing 3 new large-scale LLM-augmented datasets and a new multimodal drug representation covering 5 modalities. (2) From the evaluation perspective, OpenDDI unifies 20 SOTA model baselines across 3 downstream tasks, with standardized protocols for data quality, effectiveness, generalization, robustness, and efficiency. Based on OpenDDI, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and derive 10 valuable insights for DDI prediction while exposing current limitations to provide critical guidance for this rapidly evolving field.

To address these challenges, we propose FlowSteer, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that takes a lightweight policy model as the agent and an executable canvas environment, automating workflow orchestration through multi-turn interaction. In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement. Moreover, FlowSteer provides a plug-and-play framework that supports diverse operator libraries and interchangeable LLM backends. To effectively train this interaction paradigm, we propose Canvas Workflow Relative Policy Optimization (CWRPO), which introduces diversity-constrained rewards with conditional release to stabilize learning and suppress shortcut behaviors.

However, this training fails to capture the full structure of EHR. We propose ORA, a marked time-to-event pretraining objective that jointly models event timing and associated measurements. Across multiple datasets, downstream tasks, and model architectures, this objective consistently yields more generalizable representations than next-token prediction and pretraining losses that ignore continuous measurements.

Prior work has attributed the well-documented ``bulk-and-spike'' spectral structure, where a few dominant eigenvalues are separated from a bulk of smaller ones, to the imbalance in the data covariance matrix. In this work, we challenge this view by demonstrating that such spectral Bifurcation can arise purely from the network architecture, independent of data imbalance.\n  Specifically, we analyze a deep linear network setup and prove that, even when the data covariance is perfectly balanced, the Hessian still exhibits a Bifurcation eigenvalue structure: a dominant cluster and a bulk cluster.

However, most existing analyses rely on topic- or task-specific prompts, which can substantially limit what can be observed. In this work, we study what LLMs generate from minimal, topic-neutral inputs and probe their near-unconstrained generative behavior. Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python). Furthermore, we find that the near-unconstrained generation often degenerates into repetitive phrases, revealing interesting behaviors unique to each model family.

Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds.

Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods.

Conventional CIL approaches implicitly assume that classes are morphologically static, focusing primarily on preserving previously learned representations as new classes are introduced. However, this assumption neglects intra-class evolution: a phenomenon wherein instances of the same semantic class undergo significant morphological transformations, such as a larva turning into a butterfly. Consequently, a model must both discriminate between classes and adapt to evolving appearances within a single class. To systematically address this challenge, we formalize Stage-Aware CIL (Stage-CIL), a paradigm in which each class is learned progressively through distinct morphological stages. To facilitate rigorous evaluation within this paradigm, we introduce the Stage-Bench, a 10-domain, 2-stages dataset and protocol that jointly measure inter- and intra-class forgetting. We further propose STAGE, a novel method that explicitly learns abstract and transferable evolution patterns within a fixed-size memory pool. By decoupling semantic identity from transformation dynamics, STAGE enables accurate prediction of future morphologies based on earlier representations.

We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding.

These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families.

In this work, we theoretically analyze an in-context linear regression model with multi-head linear self-attention, and compare the training dynamics of two gradient based optimizers, namely gradient descent (GD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), the latter exhibiting superior generalization properties but is prohibitively expensive for training even medium-sized LLMs. We show, for the first time, that SAM induces a lower simplicity bias (SB)-the tendency of an optimizer to preferentially learn simpler features earlier in training-and identify this reduction as a key factor underlying its improved generalization performance. Motivated by this insight, we demonstrate that altering the training data distribution by upsampling or augmenting examples learned later in training similarly reduces SB and leads to improved generalization. Our extensive experiments show that our strategy improves the performance of multiple LLMs-including Phi2-2.7B , Llama3.2-1B, Gemma3-1B-PT, and Qwen3-0.6B-Base-achieving relative accuracy gains up to 18% when fine-tuned with AdamW and Muon on mathematical reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u627e\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u591a\u5934\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08GD\uff09\u548c\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08SAM\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0SAM\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u540c\u6837\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe18%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u964d\u4f4e\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution to selectively remove such information without full retraining. However, existing methods are designed for dense models and overlook model sparsification-an essential technique for efficient LLM deployment. We find that unlearning effectiveness degrades substantially on sparse models. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that this degradation occurs because existing unlearning methods require updating all parameters, yet sparsification prunes substantial weights to zero, fundamentally limiting the model's forgetting capacity. To address this challenge, we propose Sparsity-Aware Unlearning (SAU), which decouples unlearning from sparsification objectives through gradient masking that redirects updates to surviving weights, combined with importance-aware redistribution to compensate for pruned parameters.

We introduce Safe Langevin Soft Actor-Critic (SL-SAC), a principled algorithm that addresses both issues through parameter-space exploration and distributional risk control. Our approach combines three key mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (aSGLD) for reward critics, promoting ensemble diversity and escape from poor optima; (2) distributional cost estimation via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization for tail-risk mitigation; and (3) a reactive Lagrangian relaxation scheme that adapts constraint enforcement based on the empirical CVaR of episodic costs. We provide theoretical guarantees on CVaR estimation error and demonstrate that CVaR-based Lagrange updates yield stronger constraint violation signals than expected-cost updates.

Patching techniques, commonly used and effective in time series modeling, help capture temporal dependencies by dividing the data into patches. However, existing patch-based methods fail to dynamically select patches and typically use all patches during the prediction process. In real-world time series, there are often low-quality issues during data collection, such as missing values, distribution shifts, anomalies and white noise, which may cause some patches to contain low-quality information, negatively impacting the prediction results. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust time series forecasting framework called SEER. Firstly, we propose an Augmented Embedding Module, which improves patch-wise representations using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and obtains series-wise token representations through a channel-adaptive perception mechanism.

We present the LingLanMiDian (LingLan) benchmark, a large-scale, expert-curated, multi-task suite that unifies evaluation across knowledge recall, multi-hop reasoning, information extraction, and real-world clinical decision-making. LingLan introduces a consistent metric design, a synonym-tolerant protocol for clinical labels, a per-dataset 400-item Hard subset, and a reframing of diagnosis and treatment recommendation into single-choice decision recognition. We conduct comprehensive, zero-shot evaluations on 14 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs, providing a unified perspective on their strengths and limitations in TCM commonsense knowledge understanding, reasoning, and clinical decision support; critically, the evaluation on Hard subset reveals a substantial gap between current models and human experts in TCM-specialized reasoning.

Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dTGNNs\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faKEAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TGNNs\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65f6\u672a\u533a\u5206\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165KEAT\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff08Laplacian\u3001RBF\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684MLP\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u8c03\u5236\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0eTransformer\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4DyGFormer\u63d0\u534718% MRR\uff0c\u6bd4TGN\u63d0\u53477% MRR\u3002", "conclusion": "KEAT\u80fd\u5728TGNNs\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002"}}

However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially.

For example, it is not clear if a decrease (increase) in the likelihood of preferred (dispreferred) responses during the execution of these algorithms could be interpreted as a positive or negative phenomenon. In this paper, we study how to design algorithms that can leverage additional information in the form of rating gap, which informs the learner how much the chosen response is better than the rejected one. We present new algorithms that can achieve faster statistical rates than DPO in presence of accurate rating gap information.

As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5.

The existing LTSF paradigms follow a three-stage pipeline of embedding, backbone refinement, and long-horizon prediction. However, the behaviors of individual backbone layers remain underexplored. We introduce layer sensitivity, a gradient-based metric inspired by GradCAM and effective receptive field theory, which quantifies both positive and negative contributions of each time point to a layer's latent features. Applying this metric to a three-layer MLP backbone reveals depth-specific specialization in modeling temporal dynamics in the input sequence. Motivated by these insights, we propose MoDEx, a lightweight Mixture of Depth-specific Experts, which replaces complex backbones with depth-specific MLP experts. MoDEx achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world benchmarks, ranking first in 78 percent of cases, while using significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.

However, retrieving and following these procedures presents unique challenges, such as rigid proprietary structures, condition-dependent relevance, and actionable execution requirement, which standard semantic-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms fail to address. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction.

Across eight instruction-tuned transformer models, we run two experimental paradigms -- similarity-based forced choice and free association -- over a shared 5,000-word vocabulary, collecting 17.5M+ trials to build behavior-based similarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we compare behavioral geometries to layerwise hidden-state similarity and benchmark against FastText, BERT, and cross-model consensus. We find that forced-choice behavior aligns substantially more with hidden-state geometry than free association. In a held-out-words regression, behavioral similarity (especially forced choice) predicts unseen hidden-state similarities beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus, indicating that behavior-only measurements retain recoverable information about internal semantic geometry.

While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration.

The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics.

However, conventional FL algorithms often suffer from performance disparities across clients caused by heterogeneous data distributions and unequal participation, which leads to unfair outcomes. Specifically, we focus on two core fairness challenges, i.e., representation bias, arising from misaligned client representations, and collaborative bias, stemming from inequitable contribution during aggregation, both of which degrade model performance and generalizability. To mitigate these disparities, we propose CoRe-Fed, a unified optimization framework that bridges collaborative and representation fairness via embedding-level regularization and fairness-aware aggregation. Initially, an alignment-driven mechanism promotes semantic consistency between local and global embeddings to reduce representational divergence. Subsequently, a dynamic reward-penalty-based aggregation strategy adjusts each client's weight based on participation history and embedding alignment to ensure contribution-aware aggregation.

Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning.

To effectively capture this periodic heterogeneity, we propose PHAT (Period Heterogeneity-Aware Transformer). Specifically, PHAT arranges multivariate inputs into a three-dimensional \"periodic bucket\" tensor, where the dimensions correspond to variate group characteristics with similar periodicity, time steps aligned by phase, and offsets within the period. By restricting interactions within buckets and masking cross-bucket connections, PHAT effectively avoids interference from inconsistent periods. We also propose a positive-negative attention mechanism, which captures periodic dependencies from two perspectives: periodic alignment and periodic deviation. Additionally, the periodic alignment attention scores are decomposed into positive and negative components, with a modulation term encoding periodic priors. This modulation constrains the attention mechanism to more faithfully reflect the underlying periodic trends. A mathematical explanation is provided to support this property.

However, this paradigm suffers from two critical challenges: Structural Degeneration, where hierarchical and semantic representations are entangled, and Optimization Instability, which arises from oscillatory dynamics of minimax adversarial training. To tackle these issues, we propose DisRFM, a geometry-aware GDA framework that unifies Riemannian embedding and flow-based transport. First, to overcome structural degeneration, we embed graphs into a Riemannian manifold. By adopting polar coordinates, we explicitly disentangle structure (radius) from semantics (angle). Then, we enforce topology preservation through radial Wasserstein alignment and semantic discrimination via angular clustering, thereby preventing feature entanglement and collapse. Second, we address the instability of adversarial alignment by using Riemannian flow matching. This method learns a smooth vector field to guide source features toward the target along geodesic paths, guaranteeing stable convergence. The geometric constraints further guide the flow to maintain the disentangled structure during transport. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic stability of the flow matching and derive a tighter bound for the target risk.

Submitted to a conference, under review", "summary": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used technique for measuring brain activity. EEG-based signals can reveal a persons emotional state, as they directly reflect activity in different brain regions. Emotion-aware systems and EEG-based emotion recognition are a growing research area. This paper presents how machine learning (ML) models categorize a limited dataset of EEG signals into three different classes, namely Negative, Neutral, or Positive. It also presents the complete workflow, including data preprocessing and comparison of ML models. To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals.

However, real-world scenarios present numerous open-ended problems where fixed tools often fail to meet task requirements. Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training.

Despite its central role in cognition, the mechanisms by which Transformers acquire and implement analogical reasoning remain poorly understood. In this work, inspired by the notion of functors in category theory, we formalize analogical reasoning as the inference of correspondences between entities across categories. Based on this formulation, we introduce synthetic tasks that evaluate the emergence of analogical reasoning under controlled settings. We find that the emergence of analogical reasoning is highly sensitive to data characteristics, optimization choices, and model scale. Through mechanistic analysis, we show that analogical reasoning in Transformers decomposes into two key components: (1) geometric alignment of relational structure in the embedding space, and (2) the application of a functor within the Transformer. These mechanisms enable models to transfer relational structure from one category to another, realizing analogy.

Existing approaches often rely on the parametric knowledge of a model or assume that patients provide rich and concrete information, which is unrealistic. To address these limitations, we propose a conversational diagnosis system that explores a diagnostic knowledge graph to reason in two steps: (i) generating diagnostic hypotheses from the dialogue context, and (ii) verifying hypotheses through clarifying questions, which are repeated until a final diagnosis is reached. Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV.

VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source.

Existing safety alignment for LLMs is predominantly achieved through post-training methods, which are computationally expensive and often fail to generalize well across different models.

In this work, we propose a safety-aware decoding method that requires only low-cost training of an expert model and employs a single neuron as a gating mechanism. By effectively balancing the model's intrinsic capabilities with external guidance, our approach simultaneously preserves utility and enhances output safety. It demonstrates clear advantages in training overhead and generalization across model scales, offering a new perspective on lightweight alignment for the safe and practical deployment of large language models.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating this process, existing approaches-including fine-tuned domain-specific models and advanced agent-based systems-struggle to scale to industrial IP-level design tasks. We identify three key challenges: (1) handling long, highly detailed documents, where critical interface constraints become buried in unrelated submodule descriptions; (2) generating long RTL code, where both syntactic and semantic correctness degrade sharply with increasing output length; and (3) navigating the complex debugging cycles required for functional verification through simulation and waveform analysis. To overcome these challenges, we propose LocalV, a multi-agent framework that leverages information locality in modular hardware design. LocalV decomposes the long-document to long-code generation problem into a set of short-document, short-code tasks, enabling scalable generation and debugging. Specifically, LocalV integrates hierarchical document partitioning, task planning, localized code generation, interface-consistent merging, and AST-guided locality-aware debugging.

Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge.

According to Imbens' criterion, true distribution balance requires matching the first moments with respect to any balancing function. We demonstrate that existing objectives fail to meet this criterion, as they enforce moment matching only for one or two predefined balancing functions, thus failing to achieve full distribution balance. To address this limitation, we propose direct forecasting with kernelized moment balancing (KMB-DF). Unlike existing objectives, KMB-DF adaptively selects the most informative balancing functions from a reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS) to enforce sufficient distribution balancing. We derive a tractable and differentiable objective that enables efficient estimation from empirical samples and seamless integration into gradient-based training pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets show that KMB-DF consistently improves forecasting accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system.

Most existing approaches treat continual learning as avoiding interference with past updates, rather than considering what properties make the current task-specific update naturally preserve previously acquired knowledge. From a knowledge-decomposition perspective, we observe that low-rank adaptations exhibit highly imbalanced singular value spectra: a few dominant components absorb most of the adaptation energy, thereby (i) more likely to disrupt previously acquired knowledge and (ii) making the update more vulnerable to interference from subsequent tasks. To enable explicit balance among components, we decouple the magnitude of the task update from its directional structure and formulate it as a constrained optimization problem on a restricted Stiefel manifold. We address this problem using a projected first-order method compatible with standard deep-learning optimizers used in vision-language models.

Hallucinations pose various harms, from erosion of trust to widespread misinformation. Existing hallucination evaluation, however, focuses only on correctness and often overlooks consistency, necessary to distinguish and address these harms. To bridge this gap, we introduce prompt multiplicity, a framework for quantifying consistency in LLM evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant multiplicity (over 50% inconsistency in benchmarks like Med-HALT), suggesting that hallucination-related harms have been severely misunderstood.

By conditioning directly on desired trade-offs, PCD avoids the need for explicit surrogate models. To effectively explore the Pareto front, PCD employs a reweighting strategy that focuses on high-performing samples and a reference-direction mechanism to guide sampling towards novel, promising regions beyond the training data.

Existing methods often require additional training and offer limited controllability, restricting their adaptability in real-world applications.

SIDiffAgent autonomously manages prompt engineering, detects and corrects poor generations, and performs fine-grained artifact removal, yielding more reliable and consistent outputs. It further incorporates iterative self-improvement by storing a memory of previous experiences in a database. This database of past experiences is then used to inject prompt-based guidance at each stage of the agentic pipeline. \\modelour achieved an average VQA score of 0.884 on GenAIBench, significantly outperforming open-source, proprietary models and agentic methods.

A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing \"[MASK] is $B$\" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt \"$B$ is [MASK]\". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated.

Code available", "summary": "Emergent misalignment can arise when a language model is fine-tuned on a narrowly scoped supervised objective: the model learns the target behavior, yet also develops undesirable out-of-domain behaviors. We investigate a mechanistic approach to preventing emergent misalignment by identifying a small set of internal features that reliably control the misaligned behavior and then discouraging the model from strengthening these features during fine-tuning. Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect. Overall, our results show that targeted training-time constraints on internal mechanisms can mitigate emergent misalignment without degrading target-task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u5931\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u51cf\u5c11\u5931\u51c6\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u7d27\u6025\u5931\u51c6\uff0c\u5373\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u57df\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u5931\u51c6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u963b\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u76f8\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c1195%\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u5931\u51c6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u5931\u51c6\u4f1a\u518d\u73b0\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u5931\u51c6\u963b\u6b62\u6548\u679c\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u7d27\u6025\u5931\u51c6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \\textbf{+30.2\\%} on DirectRefusal and \\textbf{+21.2\\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \\textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors.

In this work, we first formalize the model provenance problem with provable guarantees, requiring rigorous coverage of all true provenances at a prescribed confidence level. Then, we propose the Model Provenance Set (MPS), which employs a sequential test-and-exclusion procedure to adaptively construct a small set satisfying the guarantee. The key idea of MPS is to test the significance of provenance existence within a candidate pool, thereby establishing a provable asymptotic guarantee at a user-specific confidence level.

Their environmental performance directly affects regional ecological security and is closely tied to national resource strategies and green transformation outcomes. Ensuring the authenticity and reliability of their environmental disclosure is thus a core and urgent issue for sustainable development and national strategic objectives.From a corporate governance perspective, this study examines equity balance as a fundamental governance mechanism, investigating its inhibitory effect on greenwashing behavior among these enterprises and the underlying pathways involved. Methodologically, the paper innovatively employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Double Machine Learning (DML) model to construct counterfactual scenarios, mitigating endogeneity concerns and precisely identifying the causal relationship between equity balance and greenwashing. The findings indicate, first, a significant negative causal relationship between equity balance and corporate greenwashing, confirming its substantive governance effect. Second, this inhibitory effect exhibits notable heterogeneity, manifesting more strongly in western regions, upstream segments of the industrial chain, and industries with high environmental sensitivity. Third, the governance effect demonstrates clear temporal dynamics, with the strongest impact occurring in the current period, followed by a diminishing yet statistically significant lagged effect, and ultimately a stable long-term cumulative influence.

Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity persists across regions, industries and individual enterprises regarding energy structure, production scale, policy intensity and governance efficacy, resulting in pronounced distribution shifts and non-stationarity in carbon emission data across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Such cross-regional and cross-enterprise data drift not only compromises the accuracy of carbon emission reporting but substantially undermines the guidance value of predictive models for production planning and carbon quota trading decisions. To address this critical challenge, we integrate causal inference perspectives with stable learning methodologies and time-series modelling, proposing a stable temporal prediction mechanism tailored to distribution shift environments. This mechanism incorporates enterprise-level energy inputs, capital investment, labour deployment, carbon pricing, governmental interventions and policy implementation intensity, constructing a risk consistency-constrained stable learning framework that extracts causal stable features (robust against external perturbations yet demonstrating long-term stable effects on carbon dioxide emissions) from multi-environment samples across diverse policies, regions and industrial sectors.

Prevailing compression strategies mitigate this through various pruning mechanisms, yet trade-off semantic recall for memory efficiency. In this work, we present LASER-KV (Layer Accumulated Selection with Exact-LSH Recall), a framework designed to test the limits of KV compression under a strict accumulative budgeting policy. We deviate from the standard fixed summary size approach by implementing a block-wise accumulation strategy governed by a protection divisor (n). This allows us to isolate the effects of compression from sliding window artifacts.

The central task of an MFBO policy is to balance the cost-efficiency of low-fidelity proxies against their reduced accuracy to ensure effective progression toward the high-fidelity optimum. Existing MFBO methods primarily capture associational dependencies between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, rather than causal mechanisms, and can perform poorly when lower-fidelity proxies are poorly aligned with the target fidelity. We propose RESCUE (REducing Sampling cost with Causal Understanding and Estimation), a multi-objective MFBO method that incorporates causal calculus to systematically address this challenge. RESCUE learns a structural causal model capturing causal relationships between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, and uses it to construct a probabilistic multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate that encodes intervention effects. Exploiting the causal structure, we introduce a causal hypervolume knowledge-gradient acquisition strategy to select input-fidelity pairs that balance expected multi-objective improvement and cost.

Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs.

While diffusion duality enables deterministic distillation for uniform models, these approaches generally underperform masked models and rely on complex integral operators. Conversely, in the masked domain, prior methods typically assume the absence of deterministic trajectories, forcing a reliance on stochastic distillation. To bridge this gap, we establish explicit Masked Diffusion Duality, proving that the masked process arises as the projection of a continuous Gaussian process via a novel maximum-value index preservation mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Masked Consistency Distillation (MCD), a principled framework that leverages this duality to analytically construct the deterministic coupled trajectories required for consistency distillation, bypassing numerical ODE solvers.

While MoE decouples capacity from compute, it introduces large memory overhead and hardware efficiency challenges. To overcome these, we propose token-indexed parameters as a novel, orthogonal scaling axis that decouple model capacity from FLOPs. Specifically, we introduce Joint-Token (JTok) and Mixture of Joint-Token (JTok-M), which augment Transformer layers with modulation vectors retrieved from auxiliary embedding tables. These vectors modulate the backbone via lightweight, element-wise operations, incurring negligible FLOPs overhead. Extensive experiments on both dense and MoE backbones, spanning from 650M (190M + 460M embedding) to 61B (17B + 44B embedding) total parameters, demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces validation loss and significantly improves downstream task performance (e.g., +4.1 on MMLU, +8.3 on ARC, +8.9 on CEval). Rigorous isoFLOPs analysis further confirms that JTok-M fundamentally shifts the quality-compute Pareto frontier, achieving comparable model quality with 35% less compute relative to vanilla MoE architectures, and we validate that token-indexed parameters exhibit a predictable power-law scaling behavior.

In this work, we explore whether language models can explicitly localize errors in incorrect reasoning, as a path toward building AI systems that can effectively correct themselves. We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization.

However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $\u03b1$-helices, $\u03b2$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information.

This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning.

However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data.

However, their integration with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures is constrained by an expert explosion: as the number of tokens generated in parallel increases, the number of distinct experts activated grows nearly linearly. This results in substantial memory traffic that pushes inference into a memory-bound regime, negating the efficiency gains of both MoE and parallel decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Expert Sharing (DES), a novel technique that shifts MoE optimization from token-centric pruning and conventional expert skipping methods to sequence-level coreset selection. To maximize expert reuse, DES identifies a compact, high-utility set of experts to satisfy the requirements of an entire parallel decoding block. We introduce two innovative selection strategies: (1) Intra-Sequence Sharing (DES-Seq), which adapts optimal allocation to the sequence level, and (2) Saliency-Aware Voting (DES-Vote), a novel mechanism that allows tokens to collectively elect a coreset based on aggregated router weights. Extensive experiments on MoE dLLMs demonstrate that DES reduces unique expert activations by over 55% and latency by up to 38%, while retaining 99% of vanilla accuracy, effectively decoupling memory overhead from the degree of parallelism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u4eab\uff08DES\uff09\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u72ec\u7279\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u62b5\u6d88\u4e86MoE\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u4eab\uff08DES\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06MoE\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u4ee5\u4ee4\u724c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e13\u5bb6\u8df3\u8fc7\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u5171\u4eab\uff08DES - Seq\uff09\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6295\u7968\uff08DES - Vote\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "DES\u51cf\u5c11\u72ec\u7279\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d85\u8fc755%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fbe38%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u755999%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DES\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u3002"}}

Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category.

In this work, we propose a method to enhance generalization at test time, i.e., without modifying pretrained weights. Building on DISCO, which provides a dictionary of neural operators trained across different dynamics, we introduce a neural operator splitting strategy that, at test time, searches over compositions of training operators to approximate unseen dynamics. On challenging out-of-distribution tasks including parameter extrapolation and novel combinations of physics phenomena, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization results, while being able to recover the underlying PDE parameters.

To perform data analysis while maintaining patient privacy, we create ML models that satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Previous works exploring private COVID-19 models are in part based on small datasets, provide weaker or unclear privacy guarantees, and do not investigate practical privacy. We suggest improvements to address these open gaps. We account for inherent class imbalances and evaluate the utility-privacy trade-off more extensively and over stricter privacy budgets. Our evaluation is supported by empirically estimating practical privacy through black-box Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The introduced DP should help limit leakage threats posed by MIAs, and our practical analysis is the first to test this hypothesis on the COVID-19 classification task. Our results indicate that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense.

Traditional subset selection methods, including those based on Determinantal Point Processes (DPP), focus on maximizing diversity but assume that selected data batches are always available error-free. This presumption prohibits their use under partial storage outage, imperfect communication, and stochastic access failures. Furthermore, we show that the original formulation collapses under such conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ProbDPP, a novel reliability-aware implementation of k-DPP that accounts for probabilistic data access by recasting the objective function with a regularization term that remains well-posed and decomposes into a geometric diversity term and unreliability cost. The resulting objective facilitates robust selection of diverse data batches under uncertainty.

The existing methods rely on establishing relations a priori, i.e. predefining graphs to capture inter-stock relationships. However, the stock-related web signals are characterised by high levels of noise, asynchrony, and challenging to obtain, resulting in poor generalisability and non-alignment between the predefined graphs and the downstream tasks. To address this, we propose GAPNet, a Graph Adaptation Plug-in Network that jointly learns task-specific topology and representations in an end-to-end manner. GAPNet attaches to existing pairwise graph or hypergraph backbone models, enabling the dynamic adaptation and rewiring of edge topologies via two complementary components: a Spatial Perception Layer that captures short-term co-movements across assets, and a Temporal Perception Layer that maintains long-term dependency under distribution shift. Across two real-world stock datasets, GAPNet has been shown to consistently enhance the profitability and stability in comparision to the state-of-the-art models, yielding annualised cumulative returns of up to 0.47 for RT-GCN and 0.63 for CI-STHPAN, with peak Sharpe Ratio of 2.20 and 2.12 respectively.

Instead of enforcing a uniform level of anonymization for all users, this approach allows individuals to choose privacy settings that align with their comfort levels. Building on this idea, we propose an adapted method for enabling Individualized Differential Privacy (IDP) in Federated Learning (FL) by handling clients according to their personal privacy preferences. By extending the SAMPLE algorithm from centralized settings to FL, we calculate client-specific sampling rates based on their heterogeneous privacy budgets and integrate them into a modified IDP-FedAvg algorithm. We test this method under realistic privacy distributions and multiple datasets.

In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent. This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance.

Most existing ECTS methods assume that the time-dependent decision costs governing the learning objective are known, fixed, and correctly specified. In practice, however, these costs are often uncertain and may change over time, leading to mismatches between training-time and deployment-time objectives. In this paper, we study ECTS under two practically relevant forms of cost non-stationarity: drift in the balance between misclassification and decision delay costs, and stochastic realizations of decision costs that deviate from the nominal training-time model. To address these challenges, we revisit representative ECTS approaches and adapt them to an online learning setting. Focusing on separable methods, we update only the triggering model during deployment, while keeping the classifier fixed.

Recent efforts pursue this in different ways, such as RL fine-tuning to elicit long CoT or scaling latent reasoning through architectural recurrence. This makes reasoning length an important scaling knob. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon (both theoretically and experimentally): under outcome-only supervision, out-of-distribution (OOD) performance can continue improving as training-time reasoning length (e.g., the token budget in RL, or the loop count in looped Transformers) increases, even after in-distribution (ID) performance has saturated. This suggests that robustness may require a larger budget than ID validation alone would indicate. We provide theoretical explanations via two mechanisms: (i) self-iteration can induce a stronger inductive bias in the hypothesis class, reshaping ID-optimal solutions in ways that improve OOD generalization; and (ii) when shortcut solutions that work for ID samples but not for OOD samples persist in the hypothesis class, regularization can reduce the learned solution's reliance on these shortcuts as the number of self-iterations increases.

We prove that learning with K strategies yields a Theta(K log K) improvement in sample complexity over binary preferences, and that DPO converges to the entropy-regularized utility-maximizing policy. To exploit this signal, we propose a two-stage training pipeline: (i) strategy selection, which optimizes the model to choose the best strategy for a given problem via best-vs-all comparisons, and (ii) execution refinement, which trains the model to correctly execute the selected strategy using margin-stratified pairs.

Our algorithm operates in the full-feedback regime and achieves $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{T})$ regret under standard linear contextual assumptions. We extend the framework with a Largest-Latency-First (LLF) confidence gate that selectively queries labels, achieving a budget-aware regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{dB} + c\\sqrt{B})$ with $B=\u03b2T$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We introduce SAGE (Structured Agentic system for hypothesis Generation and Evaluation), an agentic AI system designed to identify interpretable, engineered pathology biomarkers by grounding them in biological evidence. SAGE integrates literature-anchored reasoning with multimodal data analysis to correlate image-derived features with molecular biomarkers, such as gene expression, and clinically relevant outcomes.

The flue gas differential pressure across the air preheater unit installed in a 660 MW thermal power plant is analyzed as a case study since it mimics the batch processes due to load cycling in the power plant. Updating the failed ANN model by three transfer learning techniques reveals that ETL provides relatively higher predictive accuracy for the batch size of 5 days than those of LLTL and ALTL. However, ALTL is found to be suitable for effective update of the model trained on large batch size (8 days). A mixed trend is observed for computational requirement (hyperparameter tuning and model training) of model update techniques for different batch sizes.

In this paper, we propose an interactive agentic framework to systematically extract and quantify the knowledge of LLMs. Our method includes four adaptive exploration policies to probe knowledge at different granularities. To ensure the quality of extracted knowledge, we introduce a three-stage knowledge processing pipeline that combines vector-based filtering to remove exact duplicates, LLM-based adjudication to resolve ambiguous semantic overlaps, and domain-relevance auditing to retain valid knowledge units. Through extensive experiments, we find that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy. We also observe a clear knowledge scaling law, where larger models consistently extract more knowledge. In addition, we identify a Pass@1-versus-Pass@k trade-off: domain-specialized models achieve higher initial accuracy but degrade rapidly, while general-purpose models maintain stable performance during extended extraction.

However, existing work overlooks a fundamental psychological consensus that personality traits are dynamic and context-dependent. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTCBENCH, a systematic benchmark designed to quantify the consistency of LLM personalities under controlled situational contexts. PTCBENCH subjects models to 12 distinct external conditions spanning diverse location contexts and life events, and rigorously assesses the personality using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Our study on 39,240 personality trait records reveals that certain external scenarios (e.g., \"Unemployment\") can trigger significant personality changes of LLMs, and even alter their reasoning capabilities. Overall, PTCBENCH establishes an extensible framework for evaluating personality consistency in realistic, evolving environments, offering actionable insights for developing robust and psychologically aligned AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PTCBENCH\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u4ee3\u7406\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9700\u5f25\u8865\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PTCBENCH\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u538612\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5916\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528NEO\u4e94\u56e0\u7d20\u91cf\u8868\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf939,240\u6761\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u8bb0\u5f55\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u5916\u90e8\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u201c\u5931\u4e1a\u201d\uff09\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4eba\u683c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6539\u53d8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PTCBENCH\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5fc3\u7406\u5951\u5408\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

By formalizing the connection between Zipfian statistics and random matrix theory, we prove that the power-law decay in the singular value spectra of embeddings is a fundamental requisite for semantic encoding. We derive theoretical bounds showing that uniform quantization introduces a noise floor that disproportionately truncates this spectral tail, which induces spectral flattening and a strictly provable increase in the stable rank of representations.

However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations. First, constructing and maintaining knowledge graphs for educational content largely depends on manual curation, resulting in high cost and poor scalability. Second, most personalized education systems lack effective support for state-aware and systematic reasoning over learners' knowledge, and therefore rely on static question banks with limited adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Generative GraphRAG framework for automated knowledge modeling and personalized exercise generation. It consists of two core modules. The first module, Automated Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Constructor (Auto-HKG), leverages LLMs to automatically construct hierarchical knowledge graphs that capture structured concepts and their semantic relations from educational resources. The second module, Cognitive GraphRAG (CG-RAG), performs graph-based reasoning over a learner mastery graph and combines it with retrieval-augmented generation to produce personalized exercises that adapt to individual learning states. The proposed framework has been deployed in real-world educational scenarios, where it receives favorable user feedback, suggesting its potential to support practical personalized education systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGenerative GraphRAG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u83b7\u6b63\u9762\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenerative GraphRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684Auto - HKG\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7ec3\u4e60\u7684CG - RAG\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5df2\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7528\u6237\u7684\u826f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We close this gap by introducing Random Wavelet Features (RWF), a framework that constructs scalable, non-stationary kernel approximations by sampling from wavelet families. By harnessing the inherent localization and multi-resolution structure of wavelets, RWF generates an explicit feature map that captures complex, input-dependent patterns.

When resilience weakens, students are at risk of disengagement and may drop out and miss on opportunities. Therefore, predicting disengagement long before it happens during the window of hope is important. In this article, we test whether early warning signals of resilience loss, grounded in the concept of critical slowing down (CSD) can forecast disengagement before dropping out. CSD has been widely observed across ecological, climate, and neural systems, where it precedes tipping points into catastrophic failure (dropping out in our case). Using 1.67 million practice attempts from 9,401 students who used a digital math learning environment, we computed CSD indicators: autocorrelation, return rate, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and coefficient of variation. We found that 88.2% of students exhibited CSD signals prior to disengagement, with warnings clustering late in activity and before practice ceased (dropping out). Our results provide the first evidence of CSD in education, suggesting that universal resilience dynamics also govern social systems such as human learning. These findings offer a practical indicator for early detection of vulnerability and supporting learners across different applications and contexts long before critical events happen. Most importantly, CSD indicators arise universally, independent of the mechanisms that generate the data, offering new opportunities for portability across contexts, data types, and learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u5426\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u8f8d\u5b66\u524d\u7684\u8131\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8131\u79bb\u524d\u6709\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4efd\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u97e7\u6027\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u8131\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u60f3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u5426\u9884\u6d4b\u8f8d\u5b66\u524d\u7684\u8131\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75289401\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684167\u4e07\u6b21\u7ec3\u4e60\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u8fd4\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u3002", "result": "88.2%\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8131\u79bb\u524d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e14\u8b66\u544a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u540e\u671f\u548c\u7ec3\u4e60\u505c\u6b62\u524d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4efd\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u7528\u97e7\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4e5f\u652f\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u8de8\u60c5\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Rather than prohibiting AI, this work argues that one way to integrate AI into education is by creating uncertain situations with the help of AI models and using thinking-oriented teaching approaches, where uncertainty is a central pedagogical concept for stimulating students critical thinking. Drawing on epistemology and critical thinking research studies, we propose designing learning activities and assessments around the inherent limitations of both AI models and instructors. This encourages students to reason, question, and justify their final answers. We show how explicitly controlling AI behavior during exams (such as preventing direct answers or generating plausible but flawed responses) prevents AI from becoming a shortcut to certainty. To support this pedagogy, we introduce MindMosaicAIExam, an exam system that integrates controllable AI tools and requires students to provide initial answers, critically evaluate AI outputs, and iteratively refine their reasoning.

Using World Health Organization hemoglobin thresholds, we defined anemia status for children aged 6-59 months and formulated a binary classification task by grouping all anemia severities as \\emph{anemic} versus \\emph{not anemic}. We analyzed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2022) microdata comprising 1,855 children and initially considered 48 candidate features spanning demographic, socioeconomic, maternal, and child health characteristics. To obtain a stable and substantiated feature set, we applied four features selection techniques (Chi-square, mutual information, point-biserial correlation, and Boruta) and prioritized features supported by multi-method consensus. Five features: child age, recent fever, household size, maternal anemia, and parasite deworming were consistently selected by all methods, while amenorrhea, ethnicity indicators, and provinces were frequently retained. We then compared eight traditional machine learning classifiers (LR, KNN, DT, RF, XGBoost, SVM, NB, LDA) with two deep learning models (DNN and TabNet) using standard evaluation metrics, emphasizing F1-score and recall due to class imbalance. Among all models, logistic regression attained the best recall (0.701) and the highest F1-score (0.649), while DNN achieved the highest accuracy (0.709), and SVM yielded the strongest discrimination with the highest AUC (0.736). Overall, the results indicate that both machine learning and deep learning models can provide competitive anemia prediction and the interpretable features such as child age, infection proxy, maternal anemia, and deworming history are central for risk stratification and public health screening in Nepal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5229\u7528\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u540e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u513f\u7ae5\u8d2b\u8840\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u7b5b\u67e5\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u513f\u7ae5\u8d2b\u8840\u662f\u91cd\u5927\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u8d2b\u8840\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u7b5b\u9009\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u516b\u79cd\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u4f73\uff0cDNN\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cSVM\u7684AUC\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8d2b\u8840\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u7b5b\u67e5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems.

We first build a dual-layer enterprise ontology from structured databases and unstructured text, subsequently fusing these sources into a comprehensive enterprise ontology. To enable instruction-aligned reasoning, we propose a unified three-stage training pipeline: ontology instruction fine-tuning to improve structural understanding; text-ontology grounding to strengthen node semantic encoding; and multi-task instruction tuning on ontology-language pairs with curriculum learning to enhance semantic reasoning and generation.

Despite extensive empirical observations, a fundamental understanding of CoT is lacking--what constitutes faithful CoT reasoning, and how unfaithfulness emerges from autoregressive training. We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy.

Prior research on biases in the synthetic generation of human faces has examined demographic biases, yet there is little research on how emotional prompts influence demographic representation and how models trained in different cultural and linguistic contexts vary in their output distributions. We present a systematic audit of eight state-of-the-art T2I models comprising four models developed by Western organizations and four developed by Chinese institutions, all prompted identically. Using state-of-the-art facial analysis algorithms, we estimate the gender, race, age, and attractiveness levels in the generated faces.

However, this multimodal integration expands the attack surface by exposing the model to image-based jailbreaks crafted to induce harmful responses. Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks.

However, existing mixed-precision methods typically suffer from one of two limitations: they either rely on expensive discrete optimization to determine precision allocation, or introduce hardware inefficiencies due to irregular memory layouts. We propose SFMP, a search-free and hardware-friendly mixed-precision quantization framework for large language models. The framework is built upon four novel ideas: Fractional bit-width, which extends integer bit-width for weight matrix to fractional value and transforms discrete precision allocation as a continuous problem; 2)Block-wise mixed-precision, enabling fine-grained precision within weight matrices while remaining hardware-friendly; 3)Row-column weight reordering, which aggregates salient weights via row and column reordering, incurring only a small activation reordering overhead during inference; 4)Unified GEMM kernel, which supports mixed-precision GEMM at arbitrary average bit-width. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFMP outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise mixed-precision methods under the same memory constraints, while significantly reducing quantization cost and improving inference efficiency.

However, in real-world service-oriented deployments, data generated by heterogeneous users, devices, and application scenarios are inherently non-IID. This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic.

To address these issues, we introduce LSSF, a novel safety re-alignment framework with \\underline{L}ow-Rank \\underline{S}afety \\underline{S}ubspace \\underline{F}usion. Our proposed method exploits the low-rank characteristics of safety information in LLMs by constructing a low-rank projection matrix to extract the principal components of safety vectors. Notably, this projection matrix represents the low-rank safety subspace of the LLMs, which we have observed to remain stable during fine-tuning process and is isolated from the model's general capabilities. These principal components are used to effectively restore safety alignment when combined with fine-tuned LLMs through linear arithmetic. Additionally, to account for the varying encoding densities of safety information across different layers of LLMs, we propose a novel metric called safety singular value entropy. This metric quantifies the encoding density and allows for the dynamic computation of the safety-critical rank for each safety vector.

Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u591aLoRA\u4ee3\u7406\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5171\u4eab\u6846\u67b6LRAgent\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u591aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591aLoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u5404\u4ee3\u7406\u72ec\u7acb\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5b58\u50a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u6b64\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLRAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Flash - LoRA - Attention\u5185\u6838\u3002", "result": "LRAgent\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u9996\u4ee4\u724c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LRAgent\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u591aLoRA\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Employing a mixed-methods approach with architecture students at the Singapore Uni-versity of Technology and Design, the research analyzes student percep-tions across three distinct feedback domains: self-reflection, peer critique, and professor-led reviews. The findings reveal that students engage with LLMs not as authoritative instructors, but as collaborative \"cognitive mir-rors\" that scaffold critical thinking.

In peer critiques, the technology serves as a neutral mediator, mitigating social anxiety and the \"fear of of-fending\".

We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.\n  We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels.

However, conventional methods relying on Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face two fundamental limitations: severe performance degradation in low Jamming-to-Signal Ratio (JSR) regimes due to noise obscuration, and ``feature degeneracy'' caused by the loss of phase information in magnitude-only spectrograms. Consequently, spectrally similar signals -- such as high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation versus Band-Limited Gaussian Noise -- become indistinguishable. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the \\textbf{JSR-Guided Fusion Network (JSR-GFNet)}. This multi-modal architecture combines phase-sensitive complex In-Phase/Quadrature (IQ) samples with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms. Central to this framework is a physics-inspired dynamic gating mechanism driven by statistical signal descriptors. Acting as a conditional controller, it autonomously estimates signal reliability to dynamically reweight the contributions of a Complex-Valued ResNet (IQ stream) and an EfficientNet backbone (STFT stream). To validate the model, we introduce the Comprehensive GNSS Interference (CGI-21) dataset, simulating 21 jamming categories including software-defined waveforms from aerial platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JSR-GFNet achieves higher accuracy across the full 10--50 dB JSR spectrum. Notably, interpretability analysis confirms that the model learns a physically intuitive strategy: prioritizing spectral energy integration in noise-limited regimes while shifting focus to phase precision in high-SNR scenarios to resolve modulation ambiguities.

Importantly, unlike other structured domains, weight-space learning targets maps operating on both weight and function spaces, making expressivity analysis particularly subtle. While a few prior works provide partial expressivity results, a comprehensive characterization is still missing. In this work, we address this gap by developing a systematic theory for expressivity of weight-space networks. We first prove that all prominent permutation-equivariant networks are equivalent in expressive power. We then establish universality in both weight- and function-space settings under mild, natural assumptions on the input weights, and characterize the edge-case regimes where universality no longer holds.

Robustness analyses show PBA remains stable under varying sample sizes, role-playing prompts, and debiasing prompts, establishing its reliability for fairness auditing in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684Persona Brainstorm Audit\uff08PBA\uff09\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u504f\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8f93\u51fa\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PBA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u89d2\u8272\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7eb5\u5411\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5c06PBA\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e12\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLM\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u7248\u672c\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u8ffd\u8e2a\u504f\u5dee\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660ePBA\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "PBA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002"}}

We characterise this transition as hyper-datafication, which marks a critical juncture for the future of frontier AI and its societal impacts. To quantify and contextualise data-related costs, we analyse approximately 550,000 datasets from the Hugging Face Hub, focusing on dataset growth, storage-related energy consumption and carbon footprint, and societal representation using language data. We complement this analysis with qualitative responses from data workers in Kenya to examine the labour involved, including direct employment by big tech corporations and exposure to graphic content. We further draw on external data sources to substantiate our findings by illustrating the global disparity in data centre infrastructure. Our analyses reveal that hyper-datafication does not merely increase resource consumption but systematically redistributes environmental burdens, labour risks, and representational harms toward the Global South, precarious data workers, and under-represented cultures. Thus, we propose Data PROOFS recommendations spanning provenance, resource awareness, ownership, openness, frugality, and standards to mitigate these costs. Our work aims to make visible the often-overlooked costs of data that underpin frontier AI and to stimulate broader debate within the research community and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u5ba1\u89c6AI\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8d85\u6570\u636e\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u63d0\u51faData PROOFS\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8d85\u6570\u636e\u5316\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbfAI\u53ca\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790Hugging Face Hub\u7ea655\u4e07\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u6570\u636e\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5371\u5bb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5357\u534a\u7403\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51faData PROOFS\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5f15\u53d1\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u53ca\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables such adaptation with minimal overhead, while federated LoRA allows web service providers to fine-tune shared models without data sharing. However, in privacy-sensitive deployments, clients inject varying levels of differential privacy (DP) noise, creating privacy heterogeneity that misaligns individual incentives and global performance. In this paper, we propose WinFLoRA, a privacy-heterogeneous federated LoRA that utilizes aggregation weights as incentives with noise awareness. Specifically, the noises from clients are estimated based on the uploaded LoRA adapters. A larger weight indicates greater influence on the global model and better downstream task performance, rewarding lower-noise contributions. By up-weighting low-noise updates, WinFLoRA improves global accuracy while accommodating clients' heterogeneous privacy requirements. Consequently, WinFLoRA aligns heterogeneous client utility in terms of privacy and downstream performance with global model objectives without third-party involvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that across multiple LLMs and datasets, WinFLoRA achieves up to 52.58% higher global accuracy and up to 2.56x client utility than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Existing preference optimization methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), collapse feedback into a single scalar reward, fixing one balance among objectives and preventing traversal of the Pareto front. Recent work by Ortiz-Jimenez et al. (2023) showed that fine-tuning can be viewed in a model's tangent space, where linearized updates act as additive vectors that can be composed to jointly perform well on multiple tasks. Building on this formulation, we extend this idea to preference alignment and propose Tangent-Space Direct Preference Optimization (TS-DPO), which performs DPO within this locally linear regime to learn per-objective update directions. These directions can be linearly combined at inference to generate user-specified behaviors without additional optimization. Evaluated on the helpfulness-verbosity trade-off using the HelpSteer and UltraFeedback datasets, TS-DPO achieves broader Pareto-optimal coverage and smoother preference control than scalarized DPO.

By addressing these challenges, my work provides a more principled understanding of the limitations and potential of GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9879\u8d21\u732e\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9GNNs\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "GNNs\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u79fb\u4f4d\u7b97\u5b50\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684GNNs\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3GNNs\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce GRIT-VQ (Generalized Radius and Integrated Transform-Vector Quantization), a unified surrogate framework that keeps hard assignments in the forward pass while making VQ fully differentiable. GRIT-VQ replaces the straight-through estimator with a radius-based update that moves latents along the quantization direction with a controllable, geometry-aware step, and applies a data-agnostic integrated transform to the codebook so that all codes are updated through shared parameters instead of independently. Our theoretical analysis clarifies the fundamental optimization dynamics introduced by GRIT-VQ, establishing conditions for stable gradient flow, coordinated codebook evolution, and reliable avoidance of collapse across a broad family of quantizers.

A key challenge of MU is how to reliably audit whether a model has truly forgotten specified training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used for unlearning auditing, where samples that evade membership detection are often regarded as successfully forgotten. After carefully revisiting the reliability of MIA, we show that this assumption is flawed: failed membership inference does not imply true forgetting. We theoretically demonstrate that MIA-based auditing, when formulated as a binary classification problem, inevitably incurs statistical errors whose magnitude cannot be observed during the auditing process. This leads to overly optimistic evaluations of unlearning performance, while incurring substantial computational overhead due to shadow model training. To address these limitations, we propose Statistical Membership Inference Attack (SMIA), a novel training-free and highly effective auditing framework. SMIA directly compares the distributions of member and non-member data using statistical tests, eliminating the need for learned attack models. Moreover, SMIA outputs both a forgetting rate and a corresponding confidence interval, enabling quantified reliability of the auditing results. Extensive experiments show that SMIA provides more reliable auditing with significantly lower computational cost than existing MIA-based approaches.

Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO.

While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u591a\u65e5\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5bf9\u6700\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u591f\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a9\u76d6\u65e5\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6700\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u591a\u65e5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e94\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u65e5\u5185\u95f4\u9694\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u533a\u57df\u3001\u6307\u6807\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u671f\u90fd\u5360\u4f18\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u671f\u5ef6\u957f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u65e5\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u663c\u591c\u8bef\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ece\u4e30\u5bcc\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u5165\u624b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u65e5\u5185\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002"}}

We developed ChatEHR, a system that enables the use of LLMs with the entire patient timeline spanning several years. ChatEHR enables automations - which are static combinations of prompts and data that perform a fixed task - and interactive use in the electronic health record (EHR) via a user interface (UI). The resulting ability to sift through patient medical records for diverse use-cases such as pre-visit chart review, screening for transfer eligibility, monitoring for surgical site infections, and chart abstraction, redefines LLM use as an institutional capability. This system, accessible after user-training, enables continuous monitoring and evaluation of LLM use.\n  In 1.5 years, we built 7 automations and 1075 users have trained to become routine users of the UI, engaging in 23,000 sessions in the first 3 months of launch. For automations, being model-agnostic and accessing multiple types of data was essential for matching specific clinical or administrative tasks with the most appropriate LLM. Benchmark-based evaluations proved insufficient for monitoring and evaluation of the UI, requiring new methods to monitor performance. Generation of summaries was the most frequent task in the UI, with an estimated 0.73 hallucinations and 1.60 inaccuracies per generation. The resulting mix of cost savings, time savings, and revenue growth required a value assessment framework to prioritize work as well as quantify the impact of using LLMs. Initial estimates are $6M savings in the first year of use, without quantifying the benefit of the better care offered.

However, real intermediate domains are often unavailable or ineffective, necessitating the synthesis of intermediate samples. Flow-based models have recently been used for this purpose by interpolating between source and target distributions; however, their training typically relies on sample-based log-likelihood estimation, which can discard useful information and thus degrade GDA performance. The key to addressing this limitation is constructing the intermediate domains via samples directly. To this end, we propose an Entropy-regularized Semi-dual Unbalanced Optimal Transport (E-SUOT) framework to construct intermediate domains. Specifically, we reformulate flow-based GDA as a Lagrangian dual problem and derive an equivalent semi-dual objective that circumvents the need for likelihood estimation. However, the dual problem leads to an unstable min-max training procedure. To alleviate this issue, we further introduce entropy regularization to convert it into a more stable alternative optimization procedure.

We attribute this to two primary obstacles: (1) non-stationary temporal dynamics, which can bias the inference trajectory and lead to outlier-sensitive imputations; and (2) objective inconsistency, since imputation favors accurate pointwise recovery whereas DMs are inherently trained to generate diverse samples. To better understand these issues, we analyze DM-based TSDI process through a proximal-operator perspective and uncover that an implicit Wasserstein distance regularization inherent in the process hinders the model's ability to counteract non-stationarity and dissipative regularizer, thereby amplifying diversity at the expense of fidelity. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework called SPIRIT (Semi-Proximal Transport Regularized time-series Imputation). Specifically, we introduce entropy-induced Bregman divergence to relax the mass preserving constraint in the Wasserstein distance, formulate the semi-proximal transport (SPT) discrepancy, and theoretically prove the robustness of SPT against non-stationarity.

In contrast, one-shot federated learning (OFL) alleviates these limitations by reducing communication to a single round, thereby lowering overhead and enhancing practical deployability. Nevertheless, most existing one-shot approaches remain either impractical or constrained, for example, they often depend on the availability of a public dataset, assume homogeneous client models, or require uploading additional data or model information. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Gaussian-Head OFL (GH-OFL) family, a suite of one-shot federated methods that assume class-conditional Gaussianity of pretrained embeddings. Clients transmit only sufficient statistics (per-class counts and first/second-order moments) and the server builds heads via three components: (i) Closed-form Gaussian heads (NB/LDA/QDA) computed directly from the received statistics; (ii) FisherMix, a linear head with cosine margin trained on synthetic samples drawn in an estimated Fisher subspace; and (iii) Proto-Hyper, a lightweight low-rank residual head that refines Gaussian logits via knowledge distillation on those synthetic samples.

Their abilities to maintain internal memory and adapt quickly to unseen scenarios have offered them unparalleled performance when compared to non-recurrent counterparts. However, until today, the underlying mechanisms for their superior generalization and robustness performance remain poorly understood. In this study, by analyzing the hidden state domain of recurrent policies learned over a diverse set of training methods, model architectures, and tasks, we find that stable cyclic structures consistently emerge during interaction with the environment. Such cyclic structures share a remarkable similarity with \\textit{limit cycles} in dynamical system analysis, if we consider the policy and the environment as a joint hybrid dynamical system. Moreover, we uncover that the geometry of such limit cycles also has a structured correspondence with the policies' behaviors. These findings offer new perspectives to explain many nice properties of recurrent policies: the emergence of limit cycles stabilizes both the policies' internal memory and the task-relevant environmental states, while suppressing nuisance variability arising from environmental uncertainty; the geometry of limit cycles also encodes relational structures of behaviors, facilitating easier skill adaptation when facing non-stationary environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7b56\u7565\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u57df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u7c7b\u4f3c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6781\u9650\u73af\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6781\u9650\u73af\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u6781\u9650\u73af\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6781\u9650\u73af\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

As the context extends, the expressive capacity of such an $N$-width MLP increases, but scaling its fast weights becomes prohibitively expensive for extremely long sequences. Recently, this fast-weight scaling perspective has motivated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention, which partitions the sequence into fast-weight experts and sparsely routes the tokens to them. In this paper, we elevate this perspective to a unifying framework for a wide range of efficient attention methods by interpreting them as scaling fast weights through routing and/or compression. Then we propose a compress-and-route strategy, which compresses the $N$-width MLP into a narrower one using a small set of landmark queries and constructs deformable experts by gathering top-$k$ activated key-value pairs for each landmark query. We call this strategy a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations (MiTA), and refer to the resulting efficient mechanism as MiTA attention.

Current methods often exhibit trade-offs among these metrics, as optimizing one generally degrades at least one of the others.

While GaLore enables memory-efficient training by updating gradients in a low-rank subspace, it incurs a comparable extra training time cost due to the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) process on gradients. In this paper, we propose Lotus, a method that resolves this trade-off by simply modifying the projection process. We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces.

In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability to causally investigate the internal representations of a neural speech decoder. We perform cross-mode activation patching of internal activations across speech modes, and use tri-modal interpolation to examine whether speech representations vary discretely or continuously. We use coarse-to-fine causal tracing and causal scrubbing to find localized causal structure, allowing us to find internal subspaces that are sufficient for cross-mode transfer. In order to determine how finely distributed these effects are within layers, we perform neuron-level activation patching. We discover that small but not distributed subsets of neurons, rather than isolated units, affect the cross-mode transfer. Our results show that speech modes lie on a shared continuous causal manifold, and cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse activity.

This problem can be addressed by allowing limited online interactions to selectively refine uncertain regions of the learned value function, which is referred to as Active Reinforcement Learning (ActiveRL). While there has been good empirical success, no theoretical analysis is available in the literature. We fill this gap by developing a rigorous sample-complexity analysis of ActiveRL through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling. In this respect, we propose an algorithm and using GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, we derive high-probability guarantees showing that an $\u03b5$-optimal policy can be learned with ${\\mathcal{O}}(1/\u03b5^2)$ active transitions, improving upon the $\u03a9(1/\u03b5^2(1-\u03b3)^4)$ rate of purely offline methods.

While simulation platforms provide a promising alternative, existing approaches often suffer from a substantial visual and physical gap to real environments and rely on expensive sensors, precise robot calibration, or depth measurements, limiting their practicality at scale. We present Simulate Anything, a graphics-driven world modeling and simulation framework that enables efficient generation of high-fidelity embodied training data using only multi-view environment videos and off-the-shelf assets. Our approach reconstructs real-world environments into a photorealistic scene representation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), seamlessly capturing fine-grained geometry and appearance from video. We then leverage generative models to recover a physically realistic representation and integrate it into a simulation environment via a precision calibration target, enabling accurate scale alignment between the reconstructed scene and the real world. Together, these components provide a unified, editable, and physically grounded world model. Vision Language Action (VLA) models trained on our simulated data achieve strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, matching or even surpassing results obtained with real-world data, highlighting the potential of reconstruction-driven world modeling for scalable and practical embodied intelligence training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSimulate Anything\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u73b0\u6210\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5177\u8eab\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u826f\u597d\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af splatting\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u903c\u771f\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u7269\u7406\u903c\u771f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "Vision Language Action (VLA)\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The vanilla KD proposed by Hinton et al. has been the dominant approach in logit-based distillation and demonstrates compelling performance. However, it only performs sample-wise probability alignment between teacher and student's predictions, lacking an mechanism for class-wise comparison. Besides, vanilla KD imposes no structural constraint on the probability space. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective methodology, bilateral contrastive knowledge distillation (BicKD). This approach introduces a novel bilateral contrastive loss, which intensifies the orthogonality among different class generalization spaces while preserving consistency within the same class. The bilateral formulation enables explicit comparison of both sample-wise and class-wise prediction patterns between teacher and student. By emphasizing probabilistic orthogonality, BicKD further regularizes the geometric structure of the predictive distribution. Extensive experiments show that our BicKD method enhances knowledge transfer, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques across various model architectures and benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8fb9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08BicKD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\u673a\u5236\u4e14\u672a\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8fb9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08BicKD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8fb9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u6cdb\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u540c\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u548c\u7c7b\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "BicKD\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "BicKD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

To optimize the cardinality of pattern(s) in encoding, efficient pruning techniques have been used through the refinement of Conventional Generalized Sequential Pattern Mining(GSP) algorithm. We have proposed a mechanism for finding the frequency of a sequence which will yield significant reduction in the code table size.

However, transforming high-level intents -- such as ultra-low latency, high throughput, or energy efficiency -- into concrete control actions (i.e., low-level actuator commands) remains beyond the capability of existing heuristic approaches. This work introduces an Agentic AI system for intent-driven autonomous networks, structured around three specialized agents. A supervisory interpreter agent, powered by language models, performs both lexical parsing of intents into executable optimization templates and cognitive refinement based on feedback, constraint feasibility, and evolving network conditions. An optimizer agent converts these templates into tractable optimization problems, analyzes trade-offs, and derives preferences across objectives. Lastly, a preference-driven controller agent, based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, leverages these preferences to operate near the Pareto frontier of network performance that best satisfies the original intent. Collectively, these agents enable networks to autonomously interpret, reason over, adapt to, and act upon diverse intents and network conditions in a scalable manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u9ad8\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7531\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u597d\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u540c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u81ea\u4e3b\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, they underestimate epistemic uncertainty because they apply a Bayesian treatment only to the final layer, ignoring uncertainty induced by earlier layers. We propose a method that improves BLLs by leveraging a projection of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) features onto the space spanned by the last-layer features. This enables posterior inference that accounts for variability of the full network while retaining the low computational cost of inference of a standard BLL. We show that our method yields posterior variances that are provably greater or equal to those of a standard BLL, correcting its tendency to underestimate epistemic uncertainty.

These patterns persist across models and training stages, suggesting they reflect intrinsic properties of reasoning failure rather than superficial noise.

Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process.

Furthermore, many systems return black-box predictions that are difficult to audit or reproduce.

The agent operates over a unified easily extendable API for classification, segmentation, detection (oriented bounding boxes), spectral indices, and geospatial operators. With our proposed framework, it is possible to control the results at three levels: (i) tool-level performance on public EO benchmarks; (ii) at the agent-level to understand the capacity to generate valid, hallucination-free code; and (iii) at the task-level on specific use cases. In this work, we select two use-cases of interest: land-composition mapping and post-wildfire damage assessment. The proposed agent outperforms general-purpose LLM/VLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaVA), achieving 64.2% vs. 51.7% accuracy on land-composition and 50% vs. 0% on post-wildfire analysis, while producing results that are transparent and easy to interpret.

However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether \"Starbucks\" arises from the composition of \"star\" and \"coffee\" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10$\\times$ larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency ($r = 0.06$ vs. $r = 0.82$ for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPolySAE\u6269\u5c55SAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "SAEs\u5047\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PolySAE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u6295\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u4e2aSAE\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a2\u6d4bF1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7ea68%\uff0cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u59272 - 10\u500d\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u5171\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9879\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u5173\u3002"}}

We observe that analytic Regularized Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (RGDA) provides a Bayes-optimal alternative with accuracy comparable to SGD-based classifiers; however, its quadratic inference complexity limits its use in large-scale CIL scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Low-Rank Factorized RGDA (LR-RGDA), a scalable classifier that combines RGDA's expressivity with the efficiency of linear classifiers. By exploiting the low-rank structure of the covariance via the Woodbury matrix identity, LR-RGDA decomposes the discriminant function into a global affine term refined by a low-rank quadratic perturbation, reducing the inference complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(Cd^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(d^2 + Crd^2)$, where $C$ is the class number, $d$ the feature dimension, and $r \\ll d$ the subspace rank. To mitigate representation drift caused by backbone updates, we further introduce Hopfield-based Distribution Compensator (HopDC), a training-free mechanism that uses modern continuous Hopfield Networks to recalibrate historical class statistics through associative memory dynamics on unlabeled anchors, accompanied by a theoretical bound on the estimation error. Extensive experiments on diverse CIL benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a scalable solution for large-scale class-incremental learning with ViTs.

In this work, we systematically evaluate histopathological foundation models for regression-based tasks, demonstrated through the prediction of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score - a critical biomarker for personalized cancer treatment. Within multiple instance learning frameworks, we extract patch-level features from whole slide images (WSI) using five state-of-the-art foundation models, and evaluate their impact compared to contrastive learning-based features. Models are trained to predict continuous HRD scores based on these extracted features across breast, endometrial, and lung cancer cohorts from two public medical data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on foundation model features consistently outperform the baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities while exhibiting systematic differences among the foundation models. Additionally, we propose a distribution-based upsampling strategy to mitigate target imbalance in these datasets, significantly improving the recall and balanced accuracy for underrepresented but clinically important patient populations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different sampling strategies and instance bagsizes by ablation studies.

Moreover, they often fail to demonstrate significant performance gains over simpler methods under rigorous evaluation protocols. In this study, we propose Patch-based representation learning for time-series Anomaly detection (PaAno), a lightweight yet effective method for fast and efficient time-series anomaly detection. PaAno extracts short temporal patches from time-series training data and uses a 1D convolutional neural network to embed each patch into a vector representation. The model is trained using a combination of triplet loss and pretext loss to ensure the embeddings capture informative temporal patterns from input patches. During inference, the anomaly score at each time step is computed by comparing the embeddings of its surrounding patches to those of normal patches extracted from the training time-series. Evaluated on the TSB-AD benchmark, PaAno achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods, including those based on heavy architectures, on both univariate and multivariate time-series anomaly detection across various range-wise and point-wise performance measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5927\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5PaAno\uff0c\u5728TSB - AD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u5927\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u75281D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8865\u4e01\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u548c\u524d\u7f6e\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5468\u56f4\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u6b63\u5e38\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728TSB - AD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPaAno\u5728\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u70b9\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "PaAno\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, a resource-aware hierarchical network based on multi-spectral fusion and interpretable modules, namely the Hierarchical Parallel Pseudo-image Enhancement Fusion Network (HPPI-Net), is proposed for real-time, on-device Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Deployed on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller for low-power real-time inference, HPPI-Net achieves 96.70% accuracy while utilizing only 22.3 KiB of RAM and 439.5 KiB of ROM after optimization. HPPI-Net employs a two-layer architecture. The first layer extracts preliminary features using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrograms, while the second layer selectively activates either a dedicated module for stationary activity recognition or a parallel LSTM-MobileNet network (PLMN) for dynamic states. PLMN fuses FFT, Wavelet, and Gabor spectrograms through three parallel LSTM encoders and refines the concatenated features using Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC), thereby offering channel-level interpretability while substantially reducing multiply-accumulate operations.

Conversely, deep clustering-based methods that stratify patients into interpretable risk groups typically sacrifice predictive power.

We first formalize inference cost for LRMs and define PI-DoS, then prove that any practical PI-DoS attack should satisfy three properties: (1) a high amplification ratio, where each query induces a disproportionately long reasoning trace relative to its own length; (ii) stealthiness, in which prompts and responses remain on the natural language manifold and evade distribution shift detectors; and (iii) optimizability, in which the attack supports efficient optimization without being slowed by its own success. Under this framework, we present ReasoningBomb, a reinforcement-learning-based PI-DoS framework that is guided by a constant-time surrogate reward and trains a large reasoning-model attacker to generate short natural prompts that drive victim LRMs into pathologically long and often effectively non-terminating reasoning. Across seven open-source models (including LLMs and LRMs) and three commercial LRMs, ReasoningBomb induces 18,759 completion tokens on average and 19,263 reasoning tokens on average across reasoning models. It outperforms the the runner-up baseline by 35% in completion tokens and 38% in reasoning tokens, while inducing 6-7x more tokens than benign queries and achieving 286.7x input-to-output amplification ratio averaged across all samples.

De novo peptide generation must optimize antimicrobial activity and safety through low predicted toxicity, but likelihood-trained generators do not enforce these goals explicitly. We introduce ProDCARL, a reinforcement-learning alignment framework that couples a diffusion-based protein generator (EvoDiff OA-DM 38M) with sequence property predictors for AMP activity and peptide toxicity. We fine-tune the diffusion prior on AMP sequences to obtain a domain-aware generator. Top-k policy-gradient updates use classifier-derived rewards plus entropy regularization and early stopping to preserve diversity and reduce reward hacking. In silico experiments show ProDCARL increases the mean predicted AMP score from 0.081 after fine-tuning to 0.178. The joint high-quality hit rate reaches 6.3\\% with pAMP $>$0.7 and pTox $<$0.3.

Current mixed-precision training approaches either apply uniform precision to all GEMM operations or rely on heuristic-based methods that fail to generalize during training, leading to suboptimal convergence and instability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SNIP, a fine-grained adaptive mixed-precision training framework for LLM pretraining that supports subbyte precision. SNIP periodically collects statistics on activations, gradients, and optimizer states to assess the precision loss impact on model quality. We define two key metrics: loss divergence in the forward pass, caused by quantization-induced increases in training loss, and weight divergence in the backward pass, which measures error propagation through gradients affecting model updates. These metrics guide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that systematically optimizes layerwise precision to minimize overall quality loss while meeting efficiency targets. Experiments on 1B, 3B, 7B and 70B Llama-like models demonstrate that SNIP consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing FLOPs by up to 80% while preserving model quality across different model sizes and training phases with minimal computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u4e9a\u5b57\u8282\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6SNIP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u7edf\u4e00\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SNIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u671f\u6536\u96c6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u524d\u5411\u635f\u5931\u53d1\u6563\u548c\u540e\u5411\u6743\u91cd\u53d1\u6563\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57281B\u30013B\u30017B\u548c70B\u7c7bLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSNIP\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51cf\u5c1180%\u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SNIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Speculative sampling accelerates inference, with efficiency improving as the acceptance rate between draft and target models increases. Yet recent work reveals a fundamental trade-off: higher watermark strength reduces acceptance, preventing their simultaneous achievement. We revisit this trade-off and show it is not absolute. We introduce a quantitative measure of watermark strength that governs statistical detectability and is maximized when tokens are deterministic functions of pseudorandom numbers. Using this measure, we fully characterize the trade-off as a constrained optimization problem and derive explicit Pareto curves for two existing watermarking schemes. Finally, we introduce a principled mechanism that injects pseudorandomness into draft-token acceptance, ensuring maximal watermark strength while maintaining speculative sampling efficiency.

Training first visits points for which the gradient of the empirical risk is large and learns the directions spanned by these gradients.

Naively scaling value functions -- including with a transformer architecture, which is known to be highly scalable -- often results in learning instability and worse performance. In this work, we ask what prevents transformers from scaling effectively for value functions? Through empirical analysis, we identify the critical failure mode in this scaling: attention scores collapse as capacity increases. Our key insight is that we can effectively prevent this collapse and stabilize training by controlling the entropy of the attention scores, thereby enabling the use of larger models. To this end, we propose Transformer Q-Learning (TQL), a method that unlocks the scaling potential of transformers in learning value functions in RL. Our approach yields up to a 43% improvement in performance when scaling from the smallest to the largest network sizes, while prior methods suffer from performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7a76\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTQL\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6269\u5c55\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u627e\u51fa\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u627e\u51fa\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTransformer Q - Learning (TQL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u7684\u71b5\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5206\u6570\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u6700\u5c0f\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe43%\uff0c\u800c\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "TQL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u91ca\u653e\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We focus on a tabular finite-horizon MDP and adopt a phased learning framework. In each learning phase, multiple agents independently interact with the environment. More specifically, in each learning phase, each agent is assigned a policy, executes it, and observes the resulting trajectory. Our primary goal is to characterize the tradeoff between the number of learning phases and the number of agents, especially when the number of learning phases is small.\n  Our results identify a sharp transition governed by the horizon $H$. When the number of learning phases equals $H$, we present a computationally efficient algorithm that uses only $\\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / \u03b5^2)$ agents to obtain an $\u03b5$ approximation of the dynamics (i.e., yields an $\u03b5$-optimal policy for any reward function). We complement our algorithm with a lower bound showing that any algorithm restricted to $\u03c1< H$ phases requires at least $A^{H/\u03c1}$ agents to achieve constant accuracy.

At high noise, data-consistency gradients computed from inaccurate estimates can be geometrically incongruent with the posterior geometry, inducing early-step drift, spurious high-frequency artifacts, plus sensitivity to schedules and ill-conditioned operators. To address these concerns, we propose a noise--frequency Continuation framework that constructs a continuous family of intermediate posteriors whose likelihood enforces measurement consistency only within a noise-dependent frequency band. This principle is instantiated with a stabilized posterior sampler that combines a diffusion predictor, band-limited likelihood guidance, and a multi-resolution consistency strategy that aggressively commits reliable coarse corrections while conservatively adopting high-frequency details only when they become identifiable.

At a high level, it combines a deterministic large-language model (LLM) inference engine with a cryptoeconomically secured optimistic re-execution protocol so that every inference result can be publicly audited, reproduced, and, if necessary, economically enforced. An untrusted operator runs inference on a fixed GPU architecture, signs and encrypts the request and response, and publishes the encrypted log to EigenDA. During a challenge window, any watcher may request re-execution through EigenVerify; the result is then deterministically recomputed inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) with a threshold-released decryption key, allowing a public challenge with private data.

Traditional reconstruction algorithms exhibit various inherent limitations in LACT. Currently, most deep learning-based LACT reconstruction methods focus on multi-domain fusion or the introduction of generic priors, failing to fully align with the core imaging characteristics of LACT-such as the directionality of artifacts and directional loss of structural information, which are caused by the absence of projection angles in certain directions. Inspired by the theory of visible and invisible singularities, taking into account the aforementioned core imaging characteristics of LACT, we propose a Visible Singularities Guided Correlation network for LACT reconstruction (VSGC). The design philosophy of VSGC consists of two core steps: First, extract VS edge features from LACT images and focus the model's attention on these VS. Second, establish correlations between the VS edge features and other regions of the image. Additionally, a multi-scale loss function with anisotropic constraint is employed to constrain the model to converge in multiple aspects. Finally, qualitative and quantitative validations are conducted on both simulated and real datasets to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design. Particularly, in comparison with alternative methods, VSGC delivers more prominent performance in small angular ranges, with the PSNR improvement of 2.45 dB and the SSIM enhancement of 1.5\\%.

QUASAR autonomously orchestrates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient memory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screening and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework.

We used the U-Net architecture based on residual CBAM to better encode and fuse audio and visual modal information. Additionally, the semantic alignment module extends the receptive field of the generator network to obtain the spatial and channel information of the visual features efficiently; and match statistical information of visual features with audio latent vector to achieve the adjustment and injection of the audio content information to the visual information. To achieve exact lip synchronization and to generate realistic high-quality images, our approach adopts LPIPS Loss, which simulates human judgment of image quality and reduces instability possibility during the training process. The proposed method achieves outstanding performance in terms of lip synchronization accuracy and visual quality as demonstrated by subjective and objective evaluation results.

However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\\% to 55\\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection.

However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5668MSWTs\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5b58\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08MSWTs\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u5e26\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5149\u8c31\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728ERA5\u6c14\u5019\u518d\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6c14\u5019\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "MSWTs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Rank-and-Reason (VenusRAR), a two-stage agentic framework to automate this workflow and maximize expected wet-lab fitness.

Over-the-Top (OTT) video delivery now predominantly relies on Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming, which dynamically adjusts bitrate and resolution based on client-side constraints such as display capabilities and network bandwidth. This pipeline typically involves downsampling the original high-resolution content, encoding and transmitting it, followed by decoding and upsampling on the client side. Traditionally, these processing stages have been optimized in isolation, leading to suboptimal end-to-end rate-distortion (R-D) performance. The advent of deep learning has spurred interest in jointly optimizing the ABR pipeline using learned resampling methods. However, training such systems end-to-end remains challenging due to the non-differentiable nature of standard video codecs, which obstructs gradient-based optimization. Recent works have addressed this issue using differentiable proxy models, based either on deep neural networks or hybrid coding schemes with differentiable components such as soft quantization, to approximate the codec behavior. While differentiable proxy codecs have enabled progress in compression-aware learning, they remain approximations that may not fully capture the behavior of standard, non-differentiable codecs. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence demonstrating the inefficiencies of using standard codecs during training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that enables end-to-end training with real, non-differentiable codecs by leveraging data-driven surrogate gradients derived from actual compression errors. It facilitates the alignment between training objectives and deployment performance. Experimental results show a 5.19\\% improvement in BD-BR (PSNR) compared to codec-agnostic training approaches, consistently across the entire rate-distortion convex hull spanning multiple downsampling ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709BD - BR\uff08PSNR\uff095.19%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u6d88\u8d39\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfABR\u7ba1\u9053\u5404\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5b64\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u662f\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u65e0\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u538b\u7f29\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u51f8\u5305\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBD - BR\uff08PSNR\uff09\u67095.19%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Especially in multi-class boundary regions of RS images, the VLM-PP module can significantly improve the quality of pseudo-labels generated by the teacher, thereby correctly guiding the student model's learning. Moreover, since VLM-PP equips VLMs with open-world capabilities and is independent of the S4 architecture, it can correct mispredicted categories in low-confidence pseudo-labels whenever a discrepancy arises between its prediction and the pseudo-label.

They are carried out by highly skilled attackers who carefully study their targets and operate in a stealthy, long-term manner. Because APTs exhibit \"low-and-slow\" behavior, traditional statistical methods and shallow machine learning techniques often fail to detect them. Previous research on APT detection has explored machine learning approaches and provenance graph analysis. However, provenance-based methods often fail to capture the semantic intent behind system activities. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages semantic embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The method enhances APT detection by extracting meaningful semantic representations from unstructured system log data. First, raw system logs are transformed into high-dimensional semantic embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model. These embeddings are then analyzed using an Autoencoder (AE) to identify anomalous and potentially malicious patterns. The proposed method is evaluated using the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) dataset, which contains realistic APT attack scenarios generated by red teams in live environments. Experimental results show that the AE trained on LLM-derived embeddings outperforms widely used unsupervised baseline methods, including Isolation Forest (IForest), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Performance is measured using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), where the proposed approach consistently achieves superior results, even in complex threat scenarios.

We show that this instability is not solely due to limited capacity: in the rank-1 regime, optimization is highly sensitive to the update direction. Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant \"gap\" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines.

Inspired by the iterative nature of clinical decision-making, each visual reasoning hop integrates a Localized Spatial Refinement (LSR) module to enrich feature representations and a Cross-Reference Attention (CRA) mechanism that leads the iterative refinement process, preserving anatomical consistency. This multi-hop strategy enables robust handling of large deformations and produces a transparent sequence of intermediate predictions with a theoretical bound. Beyond accuracy, our framework offers built-in interpretability by estimating uncertainty via the stability and convergence of deformation fields across hops. Extensive evaluations on two challenging public datasets, DIR-Lab 4D CT (lung) and IXI T1-weighted MRI (brain), demonstrate that VCoR achieves competitive registration accuracy while offering rich intermediate visualizations and confidence measures.

We show that $\u03be$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories.

We further provide finite-sample guarantees for online RL that characterize learning progress across these regimes. Specifically, in a case study under idealized distributional assumptions, we show that the relative budget grows linearly over iterations.

However adoption towards agentic commerce faces a foundational trust gap: current systems are built for direct human interactions rather than agent-driven operations. It lacks core primitives across three critical stages of agentic transactions. First, Task Delegation lacks means to translate user intent into defined scopes, discover appropriate agents, and securely authorize actions. Second, Payment Settlement for tasks is processed before execution, lacking verifiable evidence to validate the agent's work. Third, Audit Mechanisms fail to capture the full transaction lifecycle, preventing clear accountability for disputes. While emerging standards address fragments of this trust gap, there still remains a critical need for a unified infrastructure that binds the entire transaction lifecycle.\n  To resolve this gap, we introduce TessPay, a unified infrastructure that replaces implicit trust with a 'Verify-then-Pay' architecture. It is a two plane architecture separating control and verification from settlement. TessPay operationalizes trust across four distinct stages: Before execution, agents are anchored in a canonical registry and user intent is captured as verifiable mandates, enabling stakeholder accountability. During execution, funds are locked in escrow while the agent executes the task and generates cryptographic evidence (TLS Notary, TEE etc.) to support Proof of Task Execution (PoTE). At settlement, the system verifies this evidence and releases funds only when the PoTE satisfies verification predicates; modular rail adapters ensure this PoTE-gated escrow remains chain-agnostic across heterogeneous payment rails. After settlement, TessPay preserves a tamper-evident audit trail to enable clear accountability for dispute resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fdb\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5546\u4e1a\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u4efb\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faTessPay\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u4ea4\u6613\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TessPay\uff0c\u91c7\u7528'\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\u652f\u4ed8'\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7ed3\u7b97\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u4efb\u64cd\u4f5c", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "TessPay\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5546\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u4ea4\u6613\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u64cd\u4f5c"}}

While empirical techniques, such as positional encoding (PE), sinusoidal activations (SIREN), and batch normalization (BN), effectively mitigate this, their theoretical justifications are predominantly post hoc, focusing on the global NTK spectrum only after modifications are applied. In this work, we reverse this paradigm by introducing a structural diagnostic framework. By performing a layer-wise decomposition of the NTK, we mathematically identify the ``Inlet Rank Collapse'': a phenomenon where the low-dimensional input coordinates fail to span the high-dimensional embedding space, creating a fundamental rank deficiency at the first layer that acts as an expressive bottleneck for the entire network. This framework provides a unified perspective to re-interpret PE, SIREN, and BN as different forms of rank restoration. Guided by this diagnosis, we derive a Rank-Expanding Initialization, a minimalist remedy that ensures the representation rank scales with the layer width without architectural modifications or computational overhead.

We propose a geometric multimodal Foundation Model (FM), named MFM-Geom, that learns representations from bp-MRI and clinical reports, encoding visual findings and information from the context of clinical variables.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features.

Despite its advantages, most existing FL-based IDS assume closed-set learning and lack mechanisms such as uncertainty estimation, semantic generalization, and explicit modeling of epistemic ambiguity in zero-day attack scenarios. Additionally, robustness to heterogeneous and unreliable clients remains a challenge in practical applications. This paper introduces a semantics-driven federated IDS framework that incorporates language-derived semantic supervision into federated optimization, enabling open-set and zero-shot intrusion detection for previously unseen attack behaviors. The approach constructs semantic attack prototypes using a Tri-LLM ensemble of GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and LLaMA-3-8B, aligning distributed telemetry features with high-level attack concepts. Inter-LLM semantic disagreement is modeled as epistemic uncertainty for zero-day risk estimation, while a trust-aware aggregation mechanism dynamically weights client updates based on reliability. Experimental results show stable semantic alignment across heterogeneous clients and consistent convergence.

However, existing shared-token designs are mostly architecture-driven and lack an explicit criterion for what information tokens should preserve to support both understanding and generation. Therefore, we introduce a capacity-constrained perspective, highlighting that in shared-token unified MLLMs the visual tokenizer behaves as a compute-bounded learner, so the token budget should prioritize reusable structure over hard-to-exploit high-entropy variations and redundancy. Motivated by this perspective, we propose InfoTok, an information-regularized visual tokenization mechanism grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. InfoTok formulates tokenization as controlling information flow from images to shared tokens to multimodal outputs, yielding a principled trade-off between compression and task relevance via mutual-information regularization.

In this work, we study how implicit bias, defined as subtle statistical prejudice, accumulates and propagates within LLMs equipped with long-term memory. To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains.

This overlooks common information-seeking scenarios with multiple plausible answers, where diversity is essential to avoid collapsing to a single dominant response, thereby constraining creativity and compromising fair and inclusive information access. Our analysis reveals a commonly overlooked limitation of standard RAG systems: they underutilize retrieved context diversity, such that increasing retrieval diversity alone does not yield diverse generations. To address this limitation, we propose DIVERGE, a plug-and-play agentic RAG framework with novel reflection-guided generation and memory-augmented iterative refinement, which promotes diverse viewpoints while preserving answer quality. We introduce novel metrics tailored to evaluating the diversity-quality trade-off in open-ended questions, and show that they correlate well with human judgments. We demonstrate that DIVERGE achieves the best diversity-quality trade-off compared to competitive baselines and previous state-of-the-art methods on the real-world Infinity-Chat dataset, substantially improving diversity while maintaining quality.

Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction.

Progress is hampered by a lack of adequate evaluation methods; current benchmarks are often restricted to closed-set vocabularies, lack fine-grained diagnostic capabilities, and fail to provide the interpretable feedback necessary to diagnose and remedy specific compositional failures. We solve these challenges by introducing SANEval (Spatial, Attribute, and Numeracy Evaluation), a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a scalable new pipeline for open-vocabulary compositional evaluation. SANEval combines a large language model (LLM) for deep prompt understanding with an LLM-enhanced, open-vocabulary object detector to robustly evaluate compositional adherence, unconstrained by a fixed vocabulary. Through extensive experiments on six state-of-the-art T2I models, we demonstrate that SANEval's automated evaluations provide a more faithful proxy for human assessment; our metric achieves a Spearman's rank correlation with statistically different results than those of existing benchmarks across tasks of attribute binding, spatial relations, and numeracy.

However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6e32\u67d3\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efagWorld\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6587\u672cWM\u727a\u7272\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9WM\u7cbe\u786e\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6e32\u67d3\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efagWorld\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "gWorld\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u592750.25\u500d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u6269\u5927\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u7ba1\u9053\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u548cgWorld\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify a simple intuition specific to preference learning that calls into question the suitability of these existing design objectives.

We then explore the roles of eight types of reasoning cues in a high-stakes clinical decision (treating patients with sepsis in intensive care). Through contextual inquiries with six teams and a think-aloud study with 25 physicians, we find that reasoning cues have distinct patterns of influence that can directly inform design.

However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms.

The core challenge is to effectively combine temporal numerical patterns with the context embedded in other modalities, such as text. While most existing methods align textual features with time-series patterns one step at a time, they neglect the multiscale temporal influences of contextual information such as time-series cycles and dynamic shifts. This mismatch between local alignment and global textual context can be addressed by spectral decomposition, which separates time series into frequency components capturing both short-term changes and long-term trends. In this paper, we propose SpecTF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates the effect of textual data on time series in the frequency domain. Our method extracts textual embeddings, projects them into the frequency domain, and fuses them with the time series' spectral components using a lightweight cross-attention mechanism.

This task demands simultaneous (i) near-perfect preservation of each item's identity, (ii) precise background and color fidelity, (iii) layout and design elements control, and (iv) complete, appealing displays showcasing all objects. However, current state-of-the-art models often alter object details, omit or duplicate objects, and produce layouts with incorrect relative sizing or inconsistent item presentations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PLACID, a framework that transforms a collection of object images into an appealing multi-object composite. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we leverage a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model with text control to preserve objects consistency, identities, and background details by exploiting temporal priors from videos. Second, we propose a novel data curation strategy that generates synthetic sequences where randomly placed objects smoothly move to their target positions. This synthetic data aligns with the video model's temporal priors during training. At inference, objects initialized at random positions consistently converge into coherent layouts guided by text, with the final frame serving as the composite image.

However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps.

Second, we design a decoupled entropy estimator that rigorously corrects bias, which enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Third, we integrate the MeanFlow formulation to achieve expressive and efficient one-step control.

We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable.

Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding.

Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%).

However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities.

One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

While existing research has largely focused on detecting single-speaker audio deepfakes, real-world malicious applications with multi-speaker conversational settings is also emerging as a major underexplored threat. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual taxonomy of multi-speaker conversational audio deepfakes, distinguishing between partial manipulations (one or multiple speakers altered) and full manipulations (entire conversations synthesized). As a first step, we introduce a new Multi-speaker Conversational Audio Deepfakes Dataset (MsCADD) of 2,830 audio clips containing real and fully synthetic two-speaker conversations, generated using VITS and SoundStorm-based NotebookLM models to simulate natural dialogue with variations in speaker gender, and conversational spontaneity. MsCADD is limited to text-to-speech (TTS) types of deepfake. We benchmark three neural baseline models; LFCC-LCNN, RawNet2, and Wav2Vec 2.0 on this dataset and report performance in terms of F1 score, accuracy, true positive rate (TPR), and true negative rate (TNR). Results show that these baseline models provided a useful benchmark, however, the results also highlight that there is a significant gap in multi-speaker deepfake research in reliably detecting synthetic voices under varied conversational dynamics. Our dataset and benchmarks provide a foundation for future research on deepfake detection in conversational scenarios, which is a highly underexplored area of research but also a major area of threat to trustworthy information in audio settings.

Most existing approaches assume model congruity (i.e., the use of fully or partially homogeneous models) across users, which limits their applicability in realistic settings. To overcome this limitation, we aim to learn a shared representation space across tasks rather than shared model parameters. To this end, we propose Muscle loss, a novel contrastive learning objective that simultaneously aligns representations from all participating models. Unlike existing multi-view or multi-model contrastive methods, which typically align models pairwise, Muscle loss can effectively capture dependencies across tasks because its minimization is equivalent to the maximization of mutual information among all the models' representations. Building on this principle, we develop FedMuscle, a practical and communication-efficient FMTL algorithm that naturally handles both model and task heterogeneity.

We evaluate detection-time integrity under a semantics-preserving threat model by instantiating diverse behavior-preserving code transformations on a unified C/C++ benchmark (N=5000), and introduce a metric of joint robustness across different attack methods/carriers. Across models, we observe a systemic failure of semantic invariant adversarial transformations: even state-of-the-art vulnerability detectors perform well on clean inputs while predictions flip under behavior-equivalent edits.

Although large volumes of CT images and reports are readily available in clinical picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), 3D segmentations of critical findings are costly to obtain, typically requiring extensive manual annotation by radiologists. On the other hand, it is common for radiologists to provide limited annotations of findings during routine reads, such as line measurements and arrows, that are often stored in PACS as GSPS objects. We posit that these sparse annotations can be extracted along with CT volumes and converted into 3D segmentations using promptable segmentation models, a paradigm we term Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation. To enable this paradigm, we propose SAM2CT, the first promptable segmentation model designed to convert radiologist annotations into 3D segmentations in CT volumes. SAM2CT builds upon SAM2 by extending the prompt encoder to support arrow and line inputs and by introducing Memory-Conditioned Memories (MCM), a memory encoding strategy tailored to 3D medical volumes. On public lesion segmentation benchmarks, SAM2CT outperforms existing promptable segmentation models and similarly trained baselines, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.649 for arrow prompts and 0.757 for line prompts. Applying the model to pre-existing GSPS annotations from a clinical PACS (N = 60), SAM2CT generates 3D segmentations that are clinically acceptable or require only minor adjustments in 87% of cases, as scored by radiologists. Additionally, SAM2CT demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on select Emergency Department findings.

Existing mitigation strategies reduce average error rates but do not provide explicit control over the \\emph{frequency} of such failures under repeated use. We formulate inference as a deployment-time risk control problem and introduce \\emph{chance-constrained inference}, which directly bounds the probability of hallucinations among accepted generations. Hallucinations are modeled as stochastic constraint violations, and we show that confidence-based selective prediction does not, in general, imply probabilistic risk guarantees. To enforce chance constraints efficiently, we propose a sequential, anytime-valid inference procedure that adaptively certifies feasibility or infeasibility using finite samples, avoiding conservative fixed-sample bounds.

Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enables the high-throughput acquisition of fragment fingerprints, these spectra often reflect higher-order interactions involving the concerted cleavage of multiple atoms and bonds-crucial for resolving complex isomers and non-local fragmentation mechanisms. However, most existing methods adopt atom-centric and pairwise interaction modeling, overlooking higher-order edge interactions and lacking the capacity to systematically capture essential many-body characteristics for structure generation. To overcome these limitations, we present MBGen, a Many-Body enhanced diffusion framework for de novo molecular structure Generation from mass spectra. By integrating a many-body attention mechanism and higher-order edge modeling, MBGen comprehensively leverages the rich structural information encoded in MS/MS spectra, enabling accurate de novo generation and isomer differentiation for novel molecules. Experimental results on the NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym benchmarks demonstrate that MBGen achieves superior performance, with improvements of up to 230% over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the scientific value and practical utility of many-body modeling for mass spectrometry-based molecular generation.

Survey paper on spatial AI agents, embodied AI, graph neural networks, and world models", "summary": "While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment.

We argue that this failure is not an engineering problem but a violation of physical postulates. Drawing inspiration from physics, we identify three constraints that any generalizing system must satisfy: (1) Locality -- information propagates at finite speed; (2) Symmetry -- the laws of computation are invariant across space and time; (3) Stability -- the system converges to discrete attractors that resist noise accumulation. From these postulates, we derive -- rather than design -- the Spatiotemporal Evolution with Attractor Dynamics (SEAD) architecture: a neural cellular automaton where local convolutional rules are iterated until convergence. Experiments on three tasks validate our theory: (1) Parity -- demonstrating perfect length generalization via light-cone propagation; (2) Addition -- achieving scale-invariant inference from L=16 to L=1 million with 100% accuracy, exhibiting input-adaptive computation; (3) Rule 110 -- learning a Turing-complete cellular automaton without trajectory divergence.

These methods typically rely on a reward model, often distributed with public weights on platforms such as Hugging Face, to provide feedback to the bandit. While online evaluation is expensive and requires repeated trials, offline evaluation with logged data has become an attractive alternative. However, the adversarial robustness of offline bandit evaluation remains largely unexplored, particularly when an attacker perturbs the reward model (rather than the training data) prior to bandit training. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating, both theoretically and empirically, the vulnerability of offline bandit training to adversarial manipulations of the reward model. We introduce a novel threat model in which an attacker exploits offline data in high-dimensional settings to hijack the bandit's behavior. Starting with linear reward functions and extending to nonlinear models such as ReLU neural networks, we study attacks on two Hugging Face evaluators used for generative model assessment: one measuring aesthetic quality and the other assessing compositional alignment. Our results show that even small, imperceptible perturbations to the reward model's weights can drastically alter the bandit's behavior. From a theoretical perspective, we prove a striking high-dimensional effect: as input dimensionality increases, the perturbation norm required for a successful attack decreases, making modern applications such as image evaluation especially vulnerable. Extensive experiments confirm that naive random perturbations are ineffective, whereas carefully targeted perturbations achieve near-perfect attack success rates ...", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u64cd\u7eb5\u65f6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0b\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u6613\u6210\u529f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u6270\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e24\u4e2aHugging Face\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u7684\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u53d8\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u653b\u51fb\u6240\u9700\u6270\u52a8\u8303\u6570\u51cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u64cd\u7eb5\u65f6\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c24\u4e3a\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify a distinct failure mode that previous study overlooked: Attention Distraction (AD). When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence. Extensive experiments on OK-VQA, E-VQA, and InfoSeek demonstrate that MAD-RAG consistently outperforms existing baselines across different model families, yielding absolute gains of up to 4.76%, 9.20%, and 6.18% over the vanilla RAG baseline.

However, existing fusion methods process all available modalities through the network, either treating them equally or learning to assign different contribution weights, leaving a fundamental question unaddressed: for a given patient, should certain modalities be used at all? We present AdaFuse, an adaptive multimodal fusion framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn patient-specific modality selection and fusion strategies for lung cancer risk prediction. AdaFuse formulates multimodal fusion as a sequential decision process, where the policy network iteratively decides whether to incorporate an additional modality or proceed to prediction based on the information already acquired. This sequential formulation enables the model to condition each selection on previously observed modalities and terminate early when sufficient information is available, rather than committing to a fixed subset upfront.

However, existing solutions face a dilemma: Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences, while linear State Space Models (SSMs) often struggle to distinguish valuable signals from high-frequency noise, leading to wasted state capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose ASGMamba, an efficient forecasting framework designed for resource-constrained supercomputing environments. ASGMamba integrates a lightweight Adaptive Spectral Gating (ASG) mechanism that dynamically filters noise based on local spectral energy, enabling the Mamba backbone to focus its state evolution on robust temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical multi-scale architecture with variable-specific Node Embeddings to capture diverse physical characteristics. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that ASGMamba achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. While keeping strictly $$\\mathcal{O}(L)$$ complexity we significantly reduce the memory usage on long-horizon tasks, thus establishing ASGMamba as a scalable solution for high-throughput forecasting in resource limited environments.The code is available at https://github.com/hit636/ASGMamba", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8d85\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6ASGMamba\uff0c\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u65f6\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff08LTSF\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u533a\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASGMamba\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u8c31\u95e8\u63a7\uff08ASG\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u7279\u5b9a\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(L)\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "ASGMamba\u662f\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1. Furthermore, it extends across morphologies to the Spot quadruped, enabling acrobatics, such as a continuous backflip, through animation. Together, these results demonstrate robust zero-shot deployment across heterogeneous data sources and embodiments, establishing ZEST as a scalable interface between biological movements and their robotic counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faZEST\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5168\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6280\u80fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6273\u624b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u8282\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Atlas\u3001Unitree G1\u548cSpot\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ZEST\u53ef\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u662f\u751f\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u3002"}}

To mitigate this issue, we propose Latent Diffusion Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning (LaDi-RL), a framework that conducts exploration directly in a continuous latent space, where latent variables encode semantic-level reasoning trajectories. By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLaDi - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563RL\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563RL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563RL\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u65f6\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u964d\u4f4e\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLatent Diffusion Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning (LaDi - RL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u5206\u6563\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cpass@1\u548cpass@k\u5747\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210pass@1\u7edd\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca+9.4%\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406+5.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6f5c\u5728RL\u662f\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7RL\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

As a result, network architectures developed aiming at fitting general time series domains are almost not inspiring for real world practices for certain single (or few similar) domains such as Finance, Weather, Traffic, etc: each specific domain develops their own methods that rarely utilize advances in neural network architectures of time series community in recent 2-3 years. As a result, we call for the time series community to shift focus away from research on time series neural network architectures for general domains: these researches have become saturated and away from domain-specific SOTAs over time. We should either (1) focus on deep learning methods for certain specific domain(s), or (2) turn to the development of meta-learning methods for general domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u9047\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u8f6c\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u8981\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u603b\u7ed3\u76f8\u5173\u8d28\u7591\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5256\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u8df5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5f88\u5c11\u501f\u9274\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u8fd1\u5e74\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u5e94\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u53ef\u805a\u7126\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u53d1\u5c55\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Text-DJ, a novel jailbreak attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting the model's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability. Our methodology consists of three stages. First, we decompose a single harmful query into multiple and semantically related but more benign sub-queries. Second, we pick a set of distraction queries that are maximally irrelevant to the harmful query. Third, we present all decomposed sub-queries and distraction queries to the LVLM simultaneously as a grid of images, with the position of the sub-queries being middle within the grid. We demonstrate that this method successfully circumvents the safety alignment of state-of-the-art LVLMs. We argue this attack succeeds by (1) converting text-based prompts into images, bypassing standard text-based filters, and (2) inducing distractions, where the model's safety protocols fail to link the scattered sub-queries within a high number of irrelevant queries.

This omission eliminates \\emph{global competition}, a critical mechanism that enables models to sharply focus on relevant information amidst long-context noise. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Softmax Linear Attention (SLA)}, a framework designed to restore this competitive selection without sacrificing efficiency. By lifting the softmax operation from the token level to the head level, SLA leverages attention heads as coarse semantic slots, applying a competitive gating mechanism to dynamically select the most relevant subspaces. This reintroduces the ``winner-take-all'' dynamics essential for precise retrieval and robust long-context understanding. Distinct from prior methods that focus on refining local kernel functions, SLA adopts a broader perspective by exploiting the higher-level multi-head aggregation structure.

However, within these multi-agent systems, the susceptibility of agents to collective cognitive biases remains an underexplored issue. A compelling example is the Mandela effect, a phenomenon where groups collectively misremember past events as a result of false details reinforced through social influence and internalized misinformation. This vulnerability limits our understanding of memory bias in multi-agent systems and raises ethical concerns about the potential spread of misinformation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the Mandela effect in LLM-based multi-agent systems, focusing on its existence, causing factors, and mitigation strategies. We propose MANBENCH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agent behaviors across four common task types that are susceptible to the Mandela effect, using five interaction protocols that vary in agent roles and memory timescales. We evaluate agents powered by several LLMs on MANBENCH to quantify the Mandela effect and analyze how different factors affect it.

Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation. To understand why LLMs can so readily process visual tokens, we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens. With LatentLens instead, the majority of visual tokens are interpretable across all studied models and all layers. Qualitatively, we show that the descriptions produced by LatentLens are semantically meaningful and provide more fine-grained interpretations for humans compared to individual tokens.

Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it.

To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks. Its practical effectiveness is further validated on real-world agent and user behavior QA tasks.

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a key alignment framework, existing approaches often rely heavily on costly external evaluators for scoring or rewriting, incurring off-policy learnability gaps and discretization loss. Due to the lack of access to internal states, such feedback overlooks the fine-grained conflicts between different modalities that lead to hallucinations during generation.\n  To address this issue, we propose IRIS (Implicit Reward-Guided Internal Sifting), which leverages continuous implicit rewards in the native log-probability space to preserve full information density and capture internal modal competition. This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment. These results confirm that IRIS provides an efficient and principled paradigm for mitigating MLLM hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa IRIS \u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528 5.7k \u6837\u672c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0cDirect Preference Optimization \u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa IRIS \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u539f\u751f\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u9690\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u6d88\u9664\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9690\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u7b5b\u9009\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ec5\u7528 5.7k \u6837\u672c\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "IRIS \u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current DIA analysis frameworks, however, require semi-supervised training within each run for peptide-spectrum match (PSM) re-scoring. This approach is prone to overfitting and lacks generalizability across diverse species and experimental conditions. Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications.

Drawing on cross-cultural perspectives in human-centered computing and AI governance, this paper synthesizes existing evidence on multilingual model behavior, data asymmetries, and sociotechnical harm, and articulates a culturally grounded governance framework for MLLMs. We identify three interrelated governance challenges: cultural and linguistic inequities in training data and evaluation practices, misalignment between global deployment and locally situated norms, values, and power structures, and limited accountability mechanisms for addressing harms experienced by marginalized language communities. Rather than proposing new technical benchmarks, we contribute a conceptual agenda that reframes multilingual AI governance as a sociocultural and rights based problem.

Recent efforts have sought to extend this paradigm to open-ended tasks by employing LLMs-as-a-Judge to provide sequence-level rewards for policy optimization. However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges.

While most existing efforts focus on scaling up language models or constructing higher-quality training data, limited attention has been paid to effectively integrating cross-modal knowledge into the language space. In vision-language models, for instance, aligning modalities using only high-level visual features often discards the rich semantic information present in mid- and low-level features, limiting the model's ability of cross-modality understanding. To address this issue, we propose SparseCut, a general cross-modal fusion architecture for MLLMs, introducing sparse shortcut connections between the cross-modal encoder and the LLM. These shortcut connections enable the efficient and hierarchical integration of visual features at multiple levels, facilitating richer semantic fusion without increasing computational overhead. We further introduce an efficient multi-grained feature fusion module, which performs the fusion of visual features before routing them through the shortcuts. This preserves the original language context and does not increase the overall input length, thereby avoiding an increase in computational complexity for the LLM.

Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u89e3\u51b3", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8865\u6551\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25", "method": "\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u5c0f\u66f4\u65b0\u5927\u5c0f\u6291\u5236\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6839\u636e\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u914d\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u914d\u662f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898"}}

Based on this observation, Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted as a principled choice for representation learning on tree-like graphs. In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned.

In the review of current studies, earlier sequence methods treat cells as independent entities and adapt prevalent ML models to analyze their directly inherited sequence data. Despite their simplicity and intuition, these methods overlook the latent intercellular relationships driven by the functional mechanisms of biological systems and the inherent quality issues of the raw sequence data. Therefore, a series of structured methods has emerged. Although they employ various heuristic rules to capture intricate intercellular relationships and enhance the raw sequencing data, these methods often neglect biological prior knowledge. This omission incurs substantial overhead and yields suboptimal graph representations, thereby hindering the utility of ML models.\n  To address them, we propose DOGMA, a holistic data-centric framework designed for the structural reshaping and semantic enhancement of raw data through multi-level biological prior knowledge. Transcending reliance on stochastic heuristics, DOGMA redefines graph construction by integrating Statistical Anchors with Cell Ontology and Phylogenetic Trees to enable deterministic structure discovery and robust cross-species alignment.

We introduce \\textbf{Proust}, a 309M-parameter causal PLM that bridges this gap through architectural innovations adapted from recent LLM research, including grouped-query attention with shared K/V projections, cross-layer value residuals, and depthwise causal convolutions. Trained on 33B tokens in 40 B200 GPU-hours, Proust achieves Spearman $\u03c1= 0.390$ on ProteinGym substitutions, competitive with MLMs requiring 50--200$\\times$ the compute. On indels, Proust sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming models up to 20$\\times$ larger. On EVEREST viral fitness benchmarks, it approaches structure-aware methods using sequence alone. These powerful representations position Proust in a sweet spot as it also retains native generative capabilities that MLMs lack by design. Interpretability analysis reveals that per-position entropy variance predicts, to an extent, when retrieval augmentation helps and hurts. Such insights can grow in both quantity and quality at scale and inform capabilities such as test-time scaling.

We introduce OmniVCHall, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate both isolated and compositional hallucinations in video multimodal large language models (VLLMs). OmniVCHall spans diverse video domains, introduces a novel camera-based hallucination type, and defines a fine-grained taxonomy, together with adversarial answer options (e.g., \"All are correct\" and \"None of the above\") to prevent shortcut reasoning.

These components are optimized via reinforcement learning to encourage precise decision-making under compositional hallucination settings.

Our algorithm stems from the observation that most existing MDLMs rely on a confidence-based sampling strategy, where only tokens with the highest prediction confidence are preserved at each step. This restricts the generation to a noise-sensitive, greedy decoding paradigm, resulting in an inevitable collapse in the diversity of possible paths. We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as a self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality.

This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity.

Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size.

However, as modern LLMs increasingly rely on extended reasoning chains, existing schemes face two critical challenges: (1) efficiency bottleneck, where attributing a target span of M tokens within a context of length N requires O(M*N) operations, making long-context attribution prohibitively slow; and (2) faithfulness drop, where intermediate reasoning tokens absorb attribution mass, preventing importance from propagating back to the original input. To address these, we introduce FlashTrace, an efficient multi-token attribution method that employs span-wise aggregation to compute attribution over multi-token targets in a single pass, while maintaining faithfulness. Moreover, we design a recursive attribution mechanism that traces importance through intermediate reasoning chains back to source inputs. Extensive experiments on long-context retrieval (RULER) and multi-step reasoning (MATH, MorehopQA) tasks demonstrate that FlashTrace achieves over 130x speedup over existing baselines while maintaining superior faithfulness.

We propose addressing this gap by leveraging VLMs to guide the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer.

Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528VLM\u6307\u5bfc\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06LLM\u548cVLM\u96c6\u6210\u5230RL\u7684\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u9886\u57df\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad811 - 52%\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad819 - 45%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528VLM\u6307\u5bfc\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This is because occlusion is a high-level concept, it does not refer to a concrete category of object. Thus, constructing a real-world face dataset covering all categories of occlusion object is almost impossible and accurate mask annotation is labor-intensive. To deal with the problems, we present S$^3$POT, a contrast-driven framework synergizing face generation with self-supervised spatial prompting, to achieve occlusion segmentation. The framework is inspired by the insights: 1) Modern face generators' ability to realistically reconstruct occluded regions, creating an image that preserve facial geometry while eliminating occlusion, and 2) Foundation segmentation models' (e.g., SAM) capacity to extract precise mask when provided with appropriate prompts. In particular, S$^3$POT consists of three modules: Reference Generation (RF), Feature enhancement (FE), and Prompt Selection (PS). First, a reference image is produced by RF using structural guidance from parsed mask. Second, FE performs contrast of tokens between raw and reference images to obtain an initial prompt, then modifies image features with the prompt by cross-attention. Third, based on the enhanced features, PS constructs a set of positive and negative prompts and screens them with a self-attention network for a mask decoder. The network is learned under the guidance of three novel and complementary objective functions without occlusion ground truth mask involved.

In the link prediction task, high-dimensional network information is encoded into low-dimensional vectors, which are then fed to a predictor to infer new connections between nodes in the network. As the network complexity (that is, the numbers of connections and types of interactions) grows, embedding learning turns out increasingly challenging. This review covers published models on embedding learning on multiplex networks for link prediction. First, we propose refined taxonomies to classify and compare models, depending on the type of embeddings and embedding techniques. Second, we review and address the problem of reproducible and fair evaluation of embedding learning on multiplex networks for the link prediction task. Finally, we tackle evaluation on directed multiplex networks by proposing a novel and fair testing procedure. This review constitutes a crucial step towards the development of more performant and tractable embedding learning approaches for multiplex networks and their fair evaluation for the link prediction task. We also suggest guidelines on the evaluation of models, and provide an informed perspective on the challenges and tools currently available to address downstream analyses applied to multiplex networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u91cd\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u591a\u91cd\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5df2\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u91cd\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6709\u5411\u591a\u91cd\u7f51\u7edc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u5bf9\u591a\u91cd\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u6613\u5904\u7406\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u5357\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next).

Here, we introduce a computationally efficient super-resolution step that imputes slices to generate anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs. By training on domain-randomized synthetic data, we ensure that our method generalizes across dissection protocols and remains robust to large slab thicknesses. The imputed volumes yield improved automated segmentations, achieving higher Dice scores, particularly in cortical and white matter regions. Validation on surface reconstruction and atlas registration tasks demonstrates more accurate cortical surfaces and MRI registration. By enhancing the resolution and anatomical fidelity of photograph-based reconstructions, our approach strengthens the bridge between neuropathology and neuroimaging.

The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model.

To address this, we propose Grounding Video Plans with World Models (GVP-WM), a planning method that grounds video-generated plans into feasible action sequences using a learned action-conditioned world model. At test-time, GVP-WM first generates a video plan from initial and goal observations, then projects the video guidance onto the manifold of dynamically feasible latent trajectories via video-guided latent collocation. In particular, we formulate grounding as a goal-conditioned latent-space trajectory optimization problem that jointly optimizes latent states and actions under world-model dynamics, while preserving semantic alignment with the video-generated plan.

This objective presents significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent distributional shift and value function overestimation bias. These issues become even more noticeable in zero-shot reinforcement learning, where an agent trained on reward-free data must adapt to new tasks at test time without additional training. In this work, we address the off-policy problem in a zero-shot setting by discovering a theoretical connection of successor measures to stationary density ratios. Using this insight, our algorithm can infer optimal importance sampling ratios, effectively performing a stationary distribution correction with an optimal policy for any task on the fly. We benchmark our method in motion tracking tasks on SMPL Humanoid, continuous control on ExoRL, and for the long-horizon OGBench tasks.

Experimental results demonstrate that EchoReviewer-7B can achieve significant and stable improvements on core review dimensions such as evidence support and review comprehensiveness, validating citation context as a robust and effective data paradigm for reliable automated peer review.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u6295\u7a3f\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEchoReview\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEchoReview\uff0c\u4ece\u5b66\u672f\u5f15\u7528\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u96c6\u4f53\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efaEchoReview - 16K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3EchoReviewer - 7B\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "EchoReviewer - 7B\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u548c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5168\u9762\u6027\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space.

Structured pruning offers acceleration benefits but leads to significant performance degradation.

To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance.

While recent advances in continual parameter-efficient tuning (PET) of pretrained models show promise, they typically rely on multiple training epochs and explicit task cues, limiting their effectiveness in GCL scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

For flow-matching VLA policies, this degradation is closely associated with the erosion of spatial inductive bias during RL adaptation, as sparse rewards and spatially agnostic exploration increasingly favor short-horizon visual cues. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{SA-VLA}, a spatially-aware RL adaptation framework that preserves spatial grounding during policy optimization by aligning representation learning, reward design, and exploration with task geometry.

Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner.

To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), a novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost.

However, deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices, e.g., in RISC-V platforms, remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of fully connected (FC) layers, which dominate resource consumption. Low-rank factorization (LRF) offers an effective approach to compressing FC layers, but the vast design space of LRF solutions involves complex trade-offs among FLOPs, memory size, inference time, and accuracy, making the LRF process complex and time-consuming. This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency.

Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques.

Recent work has shown that linear probes trained on activation deltas of LLMs' hidden layers can effectively detect such drift. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of these detectors against adversarially optimised suffixes. We generate universal suffixes that cause poisoned inputs to evade detection across multiple probes simultaneously. Our experiments on Phi-3 3.8B and Llama-3 8B show that a single suffix can achieve high attack success rates; up to 93.91% and 99.63%, respectively, when all probes must be fooled, and nearly perfect success (>90%) under majority vote setting. These results demonstrate that activation delta-based task drift detectors are highly vulnerable to adversarial suffixes, highlighting the need for stronger defences against adaptive attacks. We also propose a defence technique where we generate multiple suffixes and randomly append one of them to the prompts while making forward passes of the LLM and train logistic regression models with these activations.

We propose Logic-Guided Vector Fields (LGVF), a neuro-symbolic framework that injects symbolic knowledge, specified as differentiable relaxations of logical constraints, into flow matching generative models. LGVF couples two complementary mechanisms: (1) a training-time logic loss that penalizes constraint violations along continuous flow trajectories, with weights that emphasize correctness near the target distribution; and (2) an inference-time adjustment that steers sampling using constraint gradients, acting as a lightweight, logic-informed correction to the learned dynamics. We evaluate LGVF on three constrained generation case studies spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-region feasibility constraints. Across all settings, LGVF reduces constraint violations by 59-82% compared to standard flow matching and achieves the lowest violation rates in each case. In the linear and ring settings, LGVF also improves distributional fidelity as measured by MMD, while in the multi-obstacle setting, we observe a satisfaction-fidelity trade-off, with improved feasibility but increased MMD.

Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u63a8\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4f46\u6807\u7b7e\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e38\u662f\u590d\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u660e\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5df2\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u98ce\u9669\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u591a\u9886\u57df\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fb9\u9645\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u540c\u65f6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This study evaluates deep learning-based nerve segmentation in ultrasound images of the brachial plexus using a U-Net architecture, with a focus on how dataset composition and annotation strategy influence segmentation performance. We find that training on combined data from multiple ultrasound machines (SIEMENS ACUSON NX3 Elite and Philips EPIQ5) provides regularization benefits for lower-performing acquisition sources, though it does not surpass single-source training when matched to the target domain. Extending the task from binary nerve segmentation to multi-class supervision (artery, vein, nerve, muscle) results in decreased nerve-specific Dice scores, with performance drops ranging from 9% to 61% depending on dataset, likely due to class imbalance and boundary ambiguity. Additionally, we observe a moderate positive correlation between nerve size and segmentation accuracy (Pearson r=0.587, p<0.001), indicating that smaller nerves remain a primary challenge.

Along with these algorithmic contributions, we provide a first in-depth analysis of how matrix scaling critically affects Shampoo convergence.

A fundamental challenge, however, is how to characterize the level of trust exhibited by an AI system itself. Here, we propose a novel elicitation method based on iterated in-context learning (Zhu and Griffiths, 2024a) and apply it to elicit trustworthiness priors using the Trust Game from behavioral game theory. The Trust Game is particularly well suited for this purpose because it operationalizes trust as voluntary exposure to risk based on beliefs about another agent, rather than self-reported attitudes. Using our method, we elicit trustworthiness priors from several leading large language models (LLMs) and find that GPT-4.1's trustworthiness priors closely track those observed in humans. Building on this result, we further examine how GPT-4.1 responds to different player personas in the Trust Game, providing an initial characterization of how such models differentiate trust across agent characteristics. Finally, we show that variation in elicited trustworthiness can be well predicted by a stereotype-based model grounded in perceived warmth and competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5f15\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT - 4.1\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u7ef4\u6301\u6821\u51c6\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u523b\u753bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u5f15\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT - 4.1\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u73a9\u5bb6\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u6e29\u6696\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Yet, the limited dynamic range of FP4 increases sensitivity to outliers. While NVFP4 mitigates quantization error via hierarchical microscaling, a persistent loss gap remains compared to BF16. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with \"post-QK\" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76NVFP4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHCP\u673a\u5236\u548cCHON\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11NVFP4\u4e0eBF16\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "4\u4f4d\u7b97\u672f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46NVFP4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0eBF16\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9NVFP4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHot - Channel Patch (HCP)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1CHON\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLA - 1.3B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cCHON\u5c06\u4e0eBF16\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece0.94%\u964d\u81f30.58%\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11NVFP4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Unlike in text, where repetition merely reduces readability, in proteins it undermines structural confidence and functional viability. To unify this problem, we present the first systematic study of repetition in PLMs. We first propose quantitative metrics to characterize motif-level and homopolymer repetition and then demonstrate their negative impact on folding reliability. To address this challenge, we propose UCCS (Utility-Controlled Contrastive Steering), which steers protein generation with a constrained dataset. Instead of naively contrasting high- vs. low-repetition sequences, we construct contrastive sets that maximize differences in repetition while tightly controlling for structural utility. This disentanglement yields steering vectors that specifically target repetition without degrading foldability. Injected at inference, these vectors consistently reduce repetition without retraining or heuristic decoding. Experiments with ESM-3 and ProtGPT2 in CATH, UniRef50, and SCOP show that our method outperforms decoding penalties and other baselines, substantially lowering repetition while preserving AlphaFold confidence scores. Our results establish repetition control as a central challenge for PLMs and highlight dataset-guided steering as a principled approach for reliable protein generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u86cb\u767d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51faUCCS\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u6298\u53e0\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u86cb\u767d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8868\u5f81\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faUCCS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u86cb\u767d\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u96c6\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u6ce8\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUCCS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u590d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559AlphaFold\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u590d\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u86cb\u767d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f15\u5bfc\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u86cb\u767d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, interacting with real environments online can be risky and costly, motivating offline federated RL (FRL), where local devices learn from fixed datasets.

Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them.

Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions.

Several online algorithms are being deployed, but they overlook the following two key challenges inherent to conversational LLM services: (1) unsatisfied users may retry queries, increasing the server backlog, and (2) requests for ``explicit\" feedback, such as ratings, degrade user experiences. In this paper, we develop a joint routing and scheduling algorithm that leverages ``implicit\" feedback inferred from user retrial behaviors. The key idea is to propose and study the framework of contextual queueing bandits with multinomial logit feedback (CQB-MNL). CQB-MNL models query retrials, as well as context-based learning for user preferences over LLMs. Our algorithm, anytime CQB (ACQB), achieves efficient learning while maintaining queue stability by combining Thompson sampling with forced exploration at a decaying rate. We show that ACQB simultaneously achieves a cumulative regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{t})$ for routing and a queue length regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$ for any large $t$. For experiments, we refine query embeddings via contrastive learning while adopting a disjoint parameter model to learn LLM-specific parameters. Experiments on SPROUT, EmbedLLM, and RouterBench datasets confirm that both algorithms consistently outperform baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This bottleneck stems from two hardware limitations: (1) limited data bandwidth between matrix and vector compute cores, and (2) the significant area cost of high-precision (FP32/16) exponentiation units (EXP2). To address these issues, we introduce a novel low-precision workflow that employs a specific 8-bit floating-point format (HiF8) and block-aware precision rescaling for softmax. Crucially, our algorithmic innovations make low-precision softmax feasible without the significant model accuracy loss that hampers direct low-precision approaches. Specifically, our design (i) halves the required data movement bandwidth by enabling matrix multiplication outputs constrained to 8-bit, and (ii) substantially reduces the EXP2 unit area by computing exponentiations in low (8-bit) precision. Extensive evaluation on language models and multi-modal models confirms the validity of our method.

Existing methods for artifact reduction, typically work in a post-hoc manner, consequently failing to intervene effectively during the core image formation process. Notably, current techniques require problematic and invasive modifications to the model weights, or depend on a computationally expensive and time-consuming process of regional refinement. To address these limitations, we propose DIAMOND, a training-free method that applies trajectory correction to mitigate artifacts during inference. By reconstructing an estimate of the clean sample at every step of the generative trajectory, DIAMOND actively steers the generation process away from latent states that lead to artifacts. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to standard Diffusion Models, demonstrating that DIAMOND provides a robust, zero-shot path to high-fidelity, artifact-free image synthesis without the need for additional training or weight modifications in modern generative architectures.

To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

While powerful, this approach faces several limitations including high token costs and privacy concerns for sensitive applications. We introduce effGen, an open-source agentic framework optimized for small language models (SLMs) that enables effective, efficient, and secure local deployment (pip install effgen). effGen makes four major contributions: (1) Enhanced tool-calling with prompt optimization that compresses contexts by 70-80% while preserving task semantics, (2) Intelligent task decomposition that breaks complex queries into parallel or sequential subtasks based on dependencies, (3) Complexity-based routing using five factors to make smart pre-execution decisions, and (4) Unified memory system combining short-term, long-term, and vector-based storage. Additionally, effGen unifies multiple agent protocols (MCP, A2A, ACP) for cross-protocol communication. Results on 13 benchmarks show effGen outperforms LangChain, AutoGen, and Smolagents with higher success rates, faster execution, and lower memory. Our results reveal that prompt optimization and complexity routing have complementary scaling behavior: optimization benefits SLMs more (11.2% gain at 1.5B vs 2.4% at 32B), while routing benefits large models more (3.6% at 1.5B vs 7.9% at 32B), providing consistent gains across all scales when combined. effGen (https://effgen.org/) is released under the MIT License, ensuring broad accessibility for research and commercial use.

However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

Prior work either hard-codes an ordering (e.g., blockwise left-to-right) or learns an ordering policy for a pretrained MDM, which incurs extra cost and can yield suboptimal solutions due to the two-stage optimization. Motivated by this, we propose order-expressive masked diffusion model (OeMDM) for a broad class of diffusion generative processes with various generation orders, enabling the interpretation of MDM, ARM, and block diffusion in a single framework. Furthermore, building on OeMDM, we introduce learnable-order masked diffusion model (LoMDM), which jointly learns the generation ordering and diffusion backbone through a single objective from scratch, enabling the diffusion model to generate text in context-dependent ordering.

While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Gr\u00fcnwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries.

We study this under a strict compute-frugal budget (single 8 GB GPU) on ValueEval'24 / ValuesML (74K English sentences). We compare (i) direct supervised transformers, (ii) HO$\\rightarrow$values pipelines that enforce the hierarchy with hard masks, and (iii) Presence$\\rightarrow$HO$\\rightarrow$values cascades, alongside low-cost add-ons (lexica, short context, topics), label-wise threshold tuning, small instruction-tuned LLM baselines ($\\le$10B), QLoRA, and simple ensembles. HO categories are learnable from single sentences (e.g., the easiest bipolar pair reaches Macro-$F_1\\approx0.58$), but hard hierarchical gating is not a reliable win: it often reduces end-task Macro-$F_1$ via error compounding and recall suppression. In contrast, label-wise threshold tuning is a high-leverage knob (up to $+0.05$ Macro-$F_1$), and small transformer ensembles provide the most consistent additional gains (up to $+0.02$ Macro-$F_1$). Small LLMs lag behind supervised encoders as stand-alone systems, yet can contribute complementary errors in cross-family ensembles.

Among existing methods, GPTQ has been widely adopted due to its efficiency; however, it neglects input statistics and inter-group correlations when determining group scales, leading to a mismatch with its goal of minimizing layer-wise reconstruction loss. In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss. In the first stage, performed prior to GPTQ, we initialize each group scale to minimize the group-wise reconstruction loss, thereby incorporating input statistics. In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization.

However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications.

A prominent approach is to fine-tune an existing model with an unlearning loss that retains overall utility. The space of suitable unlearning loss functions is vast, making the search for an optimal loss function daunting. Additionally, there might not even exist a universally optimal loss function: differences in the structure and overlap of the forget and retain data can cause a loss to work well in one setting but over-unlearn or under-unlearn in another. Our approach EvoMU tackles these two challenges simultaneously. An evolutionary search procedure automatically finds task-specific losses in the vast space of possible unlearning loss functions. This allows us to find dataset-specific losses that match or outperform existing losses from the literature, without the need for a human-in-the-loop. This work is therefore an instance of automatic scientific discovery, a.k.a. an AI co-scientist. In contrast to previous AI co-scientist works, we do so on a budget: We achieve SotA results using a small 4B parameter model (Qwen3-4B-Thinking), showing the potential of AI co-scientists with limited computational resources.

From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations.

To this end, we synthesize selection tasks from large-scale math and code instruction datasets by filtering to instances with both correct and incorrect candidate solutions, and train 1.7B-parameter models with DAPO to reward correct selections. Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models.

Other languages remain in parametric memory but are systematically suppressed. We argue that language defaultness is governed by a sparse, low-rank control circuit, language neurons, that can be mechanistically isolated and safely steered.\n  We introduce Neural FOXP2, that makes a chosen language (Hindi or Spanish) primary in a model by steering language-specific neurons. Neural FOXP2 proceeds in three stages: (i) Localize: We train per-layer SAEs so each activation decomposes into a small set of active feature components. For every feature, we quantify English vs. Hindi/Spanish selectivity overall logit-mass lift toward the target-language token set. Tracing the top-ranked features back to their strongest contributing units yields a compact language-neuron set. (ii) Steering directions: We localize controllable language-shift geometry via a spectral low-rank analysis. For each layer, we build English to target activation-difference matrices and perform layerwise SVD to extract the dominant singular directions governing language change. The eigengap and effective-rank spectra identify a compact steering subspace and an empirically chosen intervention window (where these directions are strongest and most stable). (iii) Steer: We apply a signed, sparse activation shift targeted to the language neurons. Concretely, within low to mid layers we add a positive steering along the target-language dominant directions and a compensating negative shift toward the null space for the English neurons, yielding controllable target-language defaultness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeural FOXP2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6307\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u6216\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\uff09\u4e3a\u4e3b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u9694\u79bb\u5e76\u64cd\u7eb5\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u8a00\u9ed8\u8ba4\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "method": "Neural FOXP2\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u96c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u9ed8\u8ba4\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u9ed8\u8ba4\u6027\u7531\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4f4e\u79e9\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u8def\uff08\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u88ab\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002"}}

Direct multi-step forecasting (DMS) methods enable fast, parallel prediction of all future horizons but often lose temporal consistency across steps, while iterative multi-step forecasting (IMS) preserves temporal dependencies at the cost of error accumulation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBTTF\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3LTSF\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LTSF\u4e2dDMS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001IMS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBTTF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u77bb\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7ec6\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534758%\uff0c\u5728\u6b21\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias.

Yet, dense and element-wise rounding matrices are prohibitively expensive for billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). We revisit adaptive rounding from an efficiency perspective and propose VQRound, a parameter-efficient optimization framework that reparameterizes the rounding matrix into a compact codebook. Unlike low-rank alternatives, VQRound minimizes the element-wise worst-case error under $L_\\infty$ norm, which is critical for handling heavy-tailed weight distributions in LLMs. Beyond reparameterization, we identify rounding initialization as a decisive factor and develop a lightweight end-to-end finetuning pipeline that optimizes codebooks across all layers using only 128 samples. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters.

Specifically, we align general-purpose attack methods with the specific objectives of ASAG by designing token-level and prompt-level strategies that manipulate grading outcomes while maintaining high camouflage. Furthermore, to quantify attack camouflage, we propose a novel evaluation metric that balances attack success and camouflage. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that both attack strategies effectively mislead grading models, with prompt-level attacks achieving higher success rates and token-level attacks exhibiting superior camouflage capability.

We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models.

Current approaches in this domain present a clear trade-off: PPO-style methods (e.g., GRPO/DAPO) offer training stability but exhibit slow learning trajectories due to their trust-region constraints on policy updates, while REINFORCE-style approaches (e.g., CISPO) demonstrate improved learning efficiency but suffer from performance instability as they clip importance sampling weights while still permitting non-zero gradients outside the trust-region. To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDISPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0cPPO\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6162\uff0cREINFORCE\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DISPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u54cd\u5e94\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "DISPO\u5728AIME'24\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523061.04%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eCISPO\u548cDAPO\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DISPO\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u63a2\u7d22 - \u84b8\u998f\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

These challenges are particularly prominent in long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios, where autonomous vehicles must interact with heterogeneous road users, including human-driven vehicles and vulnerable road users, under complex and uncertain conditions. This paper proposes HERMES, a holistic risk-aware end-to-end multimodal driving framework designed to inject explicit long-tail risk cues into trajectory planning. HERMES employs a foundation-model-assisted annotation pipeline to produce structured Long-Tail Scene Context and Long-Tail Planning Context, capturing hazard-centric cues together with maneuver intent and safety preference, and uses these signals to guide end-to-end planning.

While classical survival models such as Cox remain widely adopted in standard practice, they rely on restrictive assumptions, including linear covariate relationships and proportional hazards over time, that often fail to capture real-world clinical dynamics. Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood. Our architecture preserves interpretability through learnable univariate functions that indicate how individual features influence risk over time. Extensive experiments on standard survival benchmarks demonstrate that SurvKAN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art baselines across concordance and calibration metrics.

Existing methods perform token routing based on sliding-window partitions, resulting in position-based selection and fails to capture token-specific global importance.

Motivated by these limitations, we propose STILL, an intra-layer hybrid linearization framework for efficiently linearizing LLMs. STILL introduces a Self-Saliency Score with strong local-global consistency, enabling accurate token selection using sliding-window computation, and retains salient tokens for sparse softmax attention while summarizing the remaining context via linear attention. To preserve pretrained representations, we design a Norm-Preserved Feature Map (NP-Map) that decouples feature direction from magnitude and reinjects pretrained norms. We further adopt a unified training-inference architecture with chunk-wise parallelization and delayed selection to improve hardware efficiency.

In such settings, effective coordination cannot be fully designed in advance and must instead emerge through interaction. However, most prior work enforces coordination through fixed roles, workflows, or aggregation rules, leaving open the question of how well self-organizing teams perform when coordination is unconstrained. Drawing on organizational psychology, we study whether self-organizing LLM teams achieve strong synergy, where team performance matches or exceeds the best individual member. Across human-inspired and frontier ML benchmarks, we find that -- unlike human teams -- LLM teams consistently fail to match their expert agent's performance, even when explicitly told who the expert is, incurring performance losses of up to 37.6%. Decomposing this failure, we show that expert leveraging, rather than identification, is the primary bottleneck. Conversational analysis reveals a tendency toward integrative compromise -- averaging expert and non-expert views rather than appropriately weighting expertise -- which increases with team size and correlates negatively with performance.

In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the runtime state dynamics of state-of-the-art Linear Attention models. We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy.

Overall, EEG variability should be treated as both a practical constraint to manage and a meaningful signal to leverage for precision neuroscience and robust neurotechnology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u8111\u7535\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u7535\uff08EEG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u548c\u4e3b\u4f53\u5185\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u606f\u6001\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u4f4d\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173/\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u6216\u5efa\u6a21EEG\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5e38\u5927\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u5185\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06EEG\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u65e2\u89c6\u4e3a\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Existing agent frameworks rely on rigid, syntax-heavy state representations such as nested JSON, which require models to devote a substantial portion of their limited attention to syntactic processing rather than semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management. By integrating three key components: (1) a Semantic File System that represents agent state as Markdown documents aligned with common pre-training corpora, (2) a Textual Strategy Evolution module that accumulates task-solving knowledge without parameter updates, and (3) a Closed-Loop Watcher that monitors reasoning trajectories to reduce hallucinations. Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA. Replacing the document-based state with JSON leads to performance drop, while empirically validating the critical necessity of document-driven state modeling over rigid syntax.

What is missing is a principled way to consolidate explanatory information about a fixed black-box model into a persistent, auditable artefact, that accompanies the black-box throughout its life cycle. We address this gap by introducing the notion of a scientific theory of a black (SToBB). Grounded in Constructive Empiricism, a SToBB fulfils three obligations: (i) empirical adequacy with respect to all available observations of black-box behaviour, (ii) adaptability via explicit update commitments that restore adequacy when new observations arrive, and (iii) auditability through transparent documentation of assumptions, construction choices, and update behaviour. We operationalise these obligations as a general framework that specifies an extensible observation base, a traceable hypothesis class, algorithmic components for construction and revision, and documentation sufficient for third-party assessment. Explanations for concrete stakeholder needs are then obtained by querying the maintained record through interfaces, rather than by producing isolated method outputs. As a proof of concept, we instantiate a complete SToBB for a neural-network classifier on a tabular task and introduce the Constructive Box Theoriser (CoBoT) algorithm, an online procedure that constructs and maintains an empirically adequate rule-based surrogate as observations accumulate.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective training-free technique to address the massive memory and computation overhead. Existing quantization paradigms fall short as they are oblivious to two critical forms of heterogeneity: the inherent discrepancy between vision and language tokens, and the non-uniform contribution of different experts. To bridge this gap, we propose Visual Expert Quantization (VEQ), a dual-aware quantization framework designed to simultaneously accommodate cross-modal differences and heterogeneity between experts. Specifically, VEQ incorporates 1)Modality-expert-aware Quantization, which utilizes expert activation frequency to prioritize error minimization for pivotal experts, and 2)Modality-affinity-aware Quantization, which constructs an enhanced Hessian matrix by integrating token-expert affinity with modality information to guide the calibration process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verify that VEQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, under the W3A16 configuration, our method achieves significant average accuracy gains of 2.04\\% on Kimi-VL and 3.09\\% on Qwen3-VL compared to the previous SOTA quantization methods, demonstrating superior robustness across various multimodal tasks.

A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features.

One branch incorporates a latent diffusion model into the GAN generator for adversarial training, thereby making the discriminator's task more challenging and improving the quality of generated samples. The other branch leverages pretrained audio model encoders to extract features directly from raw audio waveforms for auxiliary discrimination.

We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance.

Results show that contextual cues systematically influence both personality expression and emotional tone, suggesting that the same traits are expressed differently depending on social and affective demands. This raises an important question for LLM-based dialogue agents: whether such variations reflect inconsistency or context-sensitive adaptation akin to human behavior.

However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \\emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing.

Neural operators offer a promising route by learning mappings between function spaces and enabling resolution-independent inference, yet they typically require supervised data. Physics-informed neural networks address this limitation through unsupervised training with physical constraints but often suffer from unstable convergence and limited generalization capability. To overcome these issues, we introduce a multi-stage physics-informed training strategy that achieves convergence by progressively enforcing boundary conditions in the loss landscape and subsequently incorporating interior residuals.

We introduce HopFormer, a graph Transformer that injects structure exclusively through head-specific n-hop masked sparse attention, without the use of positional encodings or architectural modifications. This design provides explicit and interpretable control over receptive fields while enabling genuinely sparse attention whose computational cost scales linearly with mask sparsity. Through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse graph structures. Our results further reveal that dense global attention is often unnecessary: on graphs with strong small-world properties, localized attention yields more stable and consistently high performance, while on graphs with weaker small-world effects, global attention offers diminishing returns.

These models achieve long-term forecasting mainly by scaling up the model size rather than through genuinely autoregressive (AR) rollout. From the perspective of large language model training, the traditional training process for time-series forecasting models ignores temporal causality. In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines. Furthermore, it enables short-horizon forecasting models to perform reliable long-term predictions at horizons over 7.5 times longer.

The framework introduces two complementary algorithms: Consecutive Step Divergence (CSD), which measures local coherence between adjacent reasoning steps, and Step-to-Final Convergence (SFC), which assesses global alignment with final answers. Each algorithm employs five statistical metrics to capture reasoning dynamics. Experiments across mathematical and medical datasets with open-source 7B-parameter models demonstrate that CSD-based features achieve strong predictive performance for correctness classification, with classical machine learning models reaching F1=0.78 and ROC-AUC=0.82, and sequential neural models substantially improving performance (F1=0.88, ROC-AUC=0.97). CSD consistently outperforms SFC, and sequential architectures outperform classical machine learning approaches. Critically, reasoning dynamics prove domain-specific: mathematical reasoning exhibits clear divergence-based discrimination patterns between correct and incorrect solutions, while medical reasoning shows minimal discriminative signals, revealing fundamental differences in how LLMs process different reasoning types.

From a materials science perspective, we examine cause-and-effect relationships governing plastic deformation, including microstructural characterization and macroscopic responses described through plasticity constitutive models. From the perspective of AI methodology, we review a broad spectrum of applied approaches, ranging from frequentist techniques such as classical machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed models to probabilistic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty quantification and generative AI methods. These data-driven approaches are discussed in the context of materials characterization and plasticity-related applications. The primary objective of this survey is to develop a comprehensive and well-organized taxonomy grounded in AI methodologies, with particular emphasis on distinguishing critical aspects of these techniques, including model architectures, data requirements, and predictive performance within the specific domain of materials plasticity.

ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping.

The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure.

We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary \"tags along\" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate).

Typically, SD employs a small draft model to generate a fixed number of draft tokens, which are then verified in parallel by the target model.

This variation suggests that using a fixed draft length limits the potential for further improvements in decoding speed. To address this challenge, we propose Pacer, a novel approach that dynamically controls draft length using a lightweight, trainable pre-verification layer. This layer pre-verifies draft tokens blockwise before they are sent to the target model, allowing the draft model to stop token generation if the blockwise pre-verification fails. We implement Pacer on multiple SD model pairs and evaluate its performance across various benchmarks.

While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes.

Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.\n  We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.\n  To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +24.8pp lift over DeFiHackLabs.

However, numerous recent works have shown that it is unable to perform basic tasks involving detecting triples of correlated tokens, or compositional tasks where multiple input tokens need to be referenced to generate a result. Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times.\n  In this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time.\n  Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions. Prior mechanisms, even for just composing two functions, could only be computed in superquadratic time, and our new lower bounds show that faster algorithms for them are not possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u2014\u2014\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u610f\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u6d89\u53ca\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u8bb0\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5df2\u6709\u9ad8\u7ef4\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6162\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u5339\u914d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u671f\u671b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u610f\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5df2\u6709\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u6743\u8861\u548c\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Despite the remarkable progress of generative AI, existing models remain largely confined to pixel-level instruction alignment and surface-level appearance preservation, failing to capture the underlying abstract logic necessary for genuine metaphorical generation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of Visual Metaphor Transfer (VMT), which challenges models to autonomously decouple the \"creative essence\" from a reference image and re-materialize that abstract logic onto a user-specified target subject. We propose a cognitive-inspired, multi-agent framework that operationalizes Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) through a novel Schema Grammar (\"G\"). This structured representation decouples relational invariants from specific visual entities, providing a rigorous foundation for cross-domain logic re-instantiation. Our pipeline executes VMT through a collaborative system of specialized agents: a perception agent that distills the reference into a schema, a transfer agent that maintains generic space invariance to discover apt carriers, a generation agent for high-fidelity synthesis and a hierarchical diagnostic agent that mimics a professional critic, performing closed-loop backtracking to identify and rectify errors across abstract logic, component selection, and prompt encoding.

New security methods called post-quantum cryptography can help protect these systems, but they often require more computing power and can slow down communication, posing a challenge for fast 6G vehicle networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive post-quantum cryptography (PQC) framework that predicts short-term mobility and channel variations and dynamically selects suitable lattice-, code-, or hash-based PQC configurations using a predictive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (APMOEA) to meet vehicular latency and security constraints.However, frequent cryptographic reconfiguration in dynamic vehicular environments introduces new attack surfaces during algorithm transitions. A secure monotonic-upgrade protocol prevents downgrade, replay, and desynchronization attacks during transitions. Theoretical results show decision stability under bounded prediction error, latency boundedness under mobility drift, and correctness under small forecast noise. These results demonstrate a practical path toward quantum-safe cryptography in future 6G vehicular networks. Through extensive experiments based on realistic mobility (LuST), weather (ERA5), and NR-V2X channel traces, we show that the proposed framework reduces end-to-end latency by up to 27\\%, lowers communication overhead by up to 65\\%, and effectively stabilizes cryptographic switching behavior using reinforcement learning.

For responsible LLM application, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques are used to estimate a model's uncertainty about its outputs, indicating the likelihood that those outputs may be problematic. For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings.

Fine-grained MoE, featuring hundreds of well-trained experts per layer and multi-expert activation per token, offers an unexplored alternative through its rich routing space. We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity. Motivated by these findings, we propose Expert-Sample, a training-free method that preserves high-confidence selections while injecting controlled stochasticity into the uncertain tail, enabling diverse generation without destabilizing outputs.

To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting.\n  Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $\u03b3_n^{1/6}$, where $\u03b3_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Wasserstein - p\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86Polyak - Ruppert\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u83b7\u5f97\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790Polyak - Ruppert\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8026\u5408\u8bba\u8bc1\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u6781\u9650Ornstein - Uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5bf9Polyak - Ruppert\u5e73\u5747\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ee5$\u03b3_n^{1/6}$\u901f\u7387\u5728p - Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0cPolyak - Ruppert\u5e73\u5747\u4ee5$n^{-1/6}$\u901f\u7387\u5728Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002"}}

Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2).

Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aRL - CRP\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8986\u76d6\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u4e89\u7528\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRL - CRP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u9690\u85cf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u5386\u53f2\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u51b2\u7a81\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "RL - CRP\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we conducted in-depth interviews with 19 knowledge workers across multiple sectors to examine how they develop GenAI competencies in real-world professional contexts.

At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks.

Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively. We also that optimized reward-model signals outperform outcomes that rely on human labels.

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context.

Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding.

HLS offers faster iteration cycles, portability, and design permutability that make it a natural layer for agentic optimization.This position paper makes three contributions.

This paper tackles this challenge as a semantic identification task from the road scenes captured by a vehicle's front-view camera. Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a \"part-versus-whole\" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u89c6\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u7ebf\u70b9\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u642d\u914d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0YOLOv13\u548cQwen2.5 - VL - 32b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u9a7e\u9a76\u65f6\u7684\u89c6\u7ebf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08YOLOv13\uff09\u3001\u5206\u5272\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\uff08SAM2\u642d\u914dEfficientNetV2\u4e0eYOLOv13\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Qwen2.5 - VL - 7b\u4e0eQwen2.5 - VL - 32b\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u7ebf\u70b9\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u642d\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08YOLOv13\uff09\u548cQwen2.5 - VL - 32b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMacro F1\u5206\u6570\u8d850.84\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578bQwen2.5 - VL - 32b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5c0f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5206\u5272\u8f85\u52a9\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ec\u56de\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Quantization reduces memory and inference costs at the risk of performance loss. Strides have been made to mitigate low precision issues mainly by understanding in-distribution (ID) task behaviour, but the attention mechanism may provide insight on quantization attributes by exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. We investigate the behaviour of quantized small-variant popular vision transformers (DeiT, DeiT3, and ViT) on common OOD datasets. ID analyses show the initial instabilities of 4-bit models, particularly of those trained on the larger ImageNet-22k, as the strongest FP32 model, DeiT3, sharply drop 17% from quantization error to be one of the weakest 4-bit models. While ViT shows reasonable quantization robustness for ID calibration, OOD detection reveals more: ViT and DeiT3 pretrained on ImageNet-22k respectively experienced a 15.0% and 19.2% average quantization delta in AUPR-out between full precision to 4-bit while their ImageNet-1k-only counterparts experienced a 9.5% and 12.0% delta.

Among these, the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) serves as a key folding primitive, showing consistent topology yet meaningful variations in morphology, connectivity, and function. Existing landmark-based methods typically model each 3HG independently, ignoring that 3HGs form higher-order folding communities that capture mesoscale structure. This simplification weakens anatomical representation and makes one-to-one matching sensitive to positional variability and noise. We propose a spectral graph representation learning framework that models community-level folding units rather than isolated landmarks. Each 3HG is encoded using a dual-profile representation combining surface topology and structural connectivity. Subject-specific spectral clustering identifies coherent folding communities, followed by topological refinement to preserve anatomical continuity. For cross-subject correspondence, we introduce Joint Morphological-Geometric Matching, jointly optimizing geometric and morphometric similarity. Across over 1000 Human Connectome Project subjects, the resulting communities show reduced morphometric variance, stronger modular organization, improved hemispheric consistency, and superior alignment compared with atlas-based and landmark-based or embedding-based baselines.

To enable practical computations, one employs finite-dimensional encoding/decoding theorems of the following kind: every continuous mapping $f$ between function spaces $E$ and $F$ is approximated in the topology of uniform convergence on compacta by continuous mappings factoring through two finite dimensional Banach spaces. Such a result is known (Kovachki et al., 2023) for $E,F$ being Banach spaces having the approximation property. We point out that the result needs no assumptions on $E,F$ whatsoever and remains true not only for all normed spaces, but for arbitrary locally convex spaces as well. At the same time, an analogous result for $C^k$-smooth mappings and the $C^k$ compact open topology, $k\\geq 1$, holds if and only if the space $E$ has the approximation property.

In this work, we show that such robustness does not survive under micro-geometric perturbations: spatial displacements can remove watermarks by breaking the phase alignment. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MarkCleaner, a watermark removal framework that avoids semantic drift caused by regeneration-based watermark removal. Specifically, MarkCleaner is trained with micro-geometry-perturbed supervision, which encourages the model to separate semantic content from strict spatial alignment and enables robust reconstruction under subtle geometric displacements. The framework adopts a mask-guided encoder that learns explicit spatial representations and a 2D Gaussian Splatting-based decoder that explicitly parameterizes geometric perturbations while preserving semantic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MarkCleaner achieves superior performance in both watermark removal effectiveness and visual fidelity, while enabling efficient real-time inference.

As LLMs are deployed for adaptive testing and personalized tutoring, this question becomes urgent -- yet we cannot answer it with existing resources. Current educational datasets provide only question identifiers and binary correctness labels, rendering them opaque to LLMs that reason in natural language. We address this gap with FoundationalASSIST, the first English educational dataset providing the complete information needed for research on LLMs in education: full question text, actual student responses (not just right/wrong), records of which wrong answers students chose, and alignment to Common Core K-12 standards. These 1.7 million interactions from 5,000 students enable research directions that were previously impossible to pursue, from fine-tuning student models to analyzing misconception patterns. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluate four frontier models (GPT-OSS-120B, Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen3-Next-80B variants) on two complementary task families: Knowledge Tracing, testing whether LLMs can predict student performance on questions, and the exact answer a student will give; and \\textbf{Pedagogical Grounding}, testing whether LLMs understand the properties that make assessment items effective. Our evaluation reveals significant gaps in current LLM capabilities. Every model barely achieves a trivial baseline on knowledge tracing. All models fall below random chance on item discrimination, indicating that LLMs do not understand what makes one problem more diagnostic than another. Models do show competence at judging relative difficulty (up to 68.6%), but this partial success only highlights the gaps elsewhere.

Yet vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly consume chart images in automated analysis pipelines, and a growing body of benchmark evidence indicates that this human-centered knowledge base does not straightforwardly transfer to machine audiences. Machines exhibit different encoding performance patterns, process images through patch-based tokenization rather than holistic perception, and fail on design patterns that pose no difficulty for humans-while occasionally succeeding where humans struggle. Current approaches address this gap primarily by bypassing vision entirely, converting charts to data tables or structured text. We argue that this response forecloses a more fundamental question: what visual representations would actually serve machine cognition well? This paper makes the case that the visualization field needs to investigate machine-oriented visual design as a distinct research problem. We synthesize evidence from VLM benchmarks, visual reasoning research, and visualization literacy studies to show that the human-machine perceptual divergence is qualitative, not merely quantitative, and critically examine the prevailing bypassing approach. We propose a conceptual distinction between human-oriented and machine-oriented visualization-not as an engineering architecture but as a recognition that different audiences may require fundamentally different design foundations-and outline a research agenda for developing the empirical foundations the field currently lacks: the beginnings of a \"machine Bertin\" to complement the human-centered knowledge the field already possesses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u547c\u5401\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ed5\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408VLM\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7d20\u517b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5ba1\u89c6\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5b9a\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u9886\u57df\u9700\u5c06\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars.

Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding.

Recent vision-language and multimodal models further extend these capabilities by incorporating auxiliary information, including captions, question and answer pairs, and metadata, which broadens applications beyond conventional computer vision tasks. However, these models are typically optimized for semantic alignment between visual and textual content rather than geospatial understanding, and therefore are not suited for representing or reasoning with structured geospatial layers. In this study, we propose a novel model that enhances remote sensing imagery processing with guidance from auxiliary geospatial information. Our approach introduces a geospatial embedding mechanism that transforms diverse geospatial data into embedding patches that are spatially aligned with image patches. To facilitate cross-modal interaction, we design a guided attention module that dynamically integrates multimodal information by computing attention weights based on correlations with auxiliary data, thereby directing the model toward the most relevant regions. In addition, the module assigns distinct roles to individual attention heads, allowing the model to capture complementary aspects of the guidance information and improving the interpretability of its predictions.

Existing approaches often treat engagement as a homogeneous time-series signal, overlooking the heterogeneous social mechanisms and platform designs that shape how misinformation spreads. In this work, we ask: ``Can neural architectures discover social exchange principles from behavioral data alone?'' We introduce \\textsc{Dreams} (\\underline{D}isentangled \\underline{R}epresentations and \\underline{E}pisodic \\underline{A}daptive \\underline{M}odeling for \\underline{S}ocial media misinformation engagements), a social exchange theory-guided framework that models misinformation engagement as a dynamic process of social exchange. Rather than treating engagement as a static outcome, \\textsc{Dreams} models it as a sequence-to-sequence adaptation problem, where each action reflects an evolving negotiation between user effort and social reward conditioned by platform context. It integrates adaptive mechanisms to learn how emotional and contextual signals propagate through time and across platforms. On a cross-platform dataset spanning $7$ platforms and 2.37M posts collected between 2021 and 2025, \\textsc{Dreams} achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting misinformation engagements, reaching a mean absolute percentage error of $19.25$\\%. This is a $43.6$\\% improvement over the strongest baseline.

While such gains are promising, a fundamental question remains: where do these improvements come from, and what cost is paid to achieve them? In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d.

This paper presents the first in-depth investigation of how the dataset imbalance amplifies backdoor vulnerability, showing that (i) the imbalance induces a majority-class bias that increases susceptibility and (ii) conventional defenses degrade significantly as the imbalance grows. To address this, we propose Randomized Probability Perturbation (RPP), a certified poisoned-sample detection framework that operates in a black-box setting using only model output probabilities. For any inspected sample, RPP determines whether the input has been backdoor-manipulated, while offering provable within-domain detectability guarantees and a probabilistic upper bound on the false positive rate. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet and ImageNet10) covering 10 backdoor attacks and 12 baseline defenses show that RPP achieves significantly higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art defenses, particularly under dataset imbalance.

While attention scores are commonly used to estimate visual token importance, they are an imperfect proxy for actual contribution. We show that Attention Contribution, which weights attention probabilities by value vector magnitude, provides a more accurate criterion for visual token selection. Our empirical analysis reveals that visual attention sinks are functionally heterogeneous, comprising Probability Dumps with low contribution that can be safely pruned, and Structural Anchors with high contribution essential for maintaining model performance. Further, we identify substantial redundancy in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) associated with visual tokens, particularly in intermediate layers where image tokens exhibit linear behavior. Based on our findings, we introduce CAPA (Contribution-Aware Pruning and FFN Approximation), a dual-strategy framework that prunes visual tokens using attention contribution at critical functional transitions and reduces FFN computation through efficient linear approximations.

Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is critical for the trustworthy uptake of generated answers. Existing UQ approaches remain weakly validated in scientific QA, a domain relying on fact-retrieval and reasoning capabilities. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating UQ metrics in reasoning-demanding QA studying calibration of UQ methods, providing an extensible open-source framework to reproducibly assess calibration. Our study spans up to 20 large language models of base, instruction-tuned and reasoning variants. Our analysis covers seven scientific QA datasets, including both multiple-choice and arithmetic question answering tasks, using prompting to emulate an open question answering setting. We evaluate and compare methods representative of prominent approaches on a total of 685,000 long-form responses, spanning different reasoning complexities representative of domain-specific tasks. At the token level, we find that instruction tuning induces strong probability mass polarization, reducing the reliability of token-level confidences as estimates of uncertainty. Models further fine-tuned for reasoning are exposed to the same effect, but the reasoning process appears to mitigate it depending on the provider. At the sequence level, we show that verbalized approaches are systematically biased and poorly correlated with correctness, while answer frequency (consistency across samples) yields the most reliable calibration. In the wake of our analysis, we study and report the misleading effect of relying exclusively on ECE as a sole measure for judging performance of UQ methods on benchmark datasets.

In this work, we propose a machine learning framework that models such comparative judgments instead of direct ratings. The model can then be applied to rank unseen image-caption pairs in the same way as a regression model trained on direct ratings. Using the VICR dataset, we extract visual features with ResNet-50 and text features with MiniLM, then train both a regression model and a comparative learning model. While the regression model achieves better performance (Pearson's $\u03c1$: 0.7609 and Spearman's $r_s$: 0.7089), the comparative learning model steadily improves with more data and approaches the regression baseline. In addition, a small-scale human evaluation study comparing absolute rating, pairwise comparison, and same-image comparison shows that comparative annotation yields faster results and has greater agreement among human annotators.

While most research has been focused on English-based models, low-resource languages such as Brazilian Portuguese face significant challenges due to the lack of specialized datasets and models. Several studies create datasets by automatically translating existing ones to mitigate resource scarcity. This work addresses this gap by proposing a cross-native-translated evaluation of Transformer-based vision and language models for Brazilian Portuguese IC. We use a version of Flickr30K comprised of captions manually created by native Brazilian Portuguese speakers and compare it to a version with captions automatically translated from English to Portuguese. The experiments include a cross-context approach, where models trained on one dataset are tested on the other to assess the translation impact. Additionally, we incorporate attention maps for model inference interpretation and use the CLIP-Score metric to evaluate the image-description alignment. Our findings show that Swin-DistilBERTimbau consistently outperforms other models, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets. ViTucano, a Brazilian Portuguese pre-trained VLM, surpasses larger multilingual models (GPT-4o, LLaMa 3.2 Vision) in traditional text-based evaluation metrics, while GPT-4 models achieve the highest CLIP-Score, highlighting improved image-text alignment.

Our approach is fully matrix-free and has the same complexity as ADAM (Kingma, 2024), $O(n)$ in both computation and memory costs. To ensure stable optimization in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the 3DGS rasterization process, we introduce a parameter-wise trust-region technique based on the squared Hellinger distance, regularizing updates to Gaussian parameters. Under identical parameter initialization and without densification, 3DGS$^2$-TR is able to achieve better reconstruction quality on standard datasets, using 50% fewer training iterations compared to ADAM, while incurring less than 1GB of peak GPU memory overhead (17% more than ADAM and 85% less than 3DGS-LM), enabling scalability to very large scenes and potentially to distributed training settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u56683DGS\u00b2 - TR\u52a0\u901f3D\u9ad8\u65af\u62fc\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u597d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u9ad8\u65af\u62fc\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u7528Hutchinson\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u65b9Hellinger\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9010\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e14\u65e0\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4ADAM\u5c11\u752850%\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5cf0\u503c\u4e0d\u52301GB\u3002", "conclusion": "3DGS\u00b2 - TR\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

However, existing automated question synthesis methods lack precise difficulty control, incur high computational costs, and struggle to generate competition-level questions at scale. In this paper, we propose CoDiQ (Controllable Difficult Question Generation), a novel framework enabling fine-grained difficulty control via test-time scaling while ensuring question solvability. Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction. Building on the CoDiQ framework, we build CoDiQ-Corpus (44K competition-grade question sequences). Human evaluations show these questions are significantly more challenging than LiveCodeBench/AIME with over 82% solvability. Training LRMs on CoDiQ-Corpus substantially improves reasoning performance, verifying that scaling controlled-difficulty training questions enhances reasoning capabilities.

Vision language models (VLMs) offer promise for autonomous laboratory safety monitoring, but their effectiveness in realistic settings is unclear due to the lack of visual evaluation data, as most safety incidents are documented primarily as unstructured text. To address this gap, we first introduce a structured data generation pipeline that converts textual laboratory scenarios into aligned triples of (image, scene graph, ground truth), using large language models as scene graph architects and image generation models as renderers.

A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification. The system integrates a calibrated vision module, a 6-DOF Staubli TX2-60L robotic arm with a custom dual electromagnetic gripper, and a rule-based packing algorithm that reduces instrument collisions during transport. The packing framework uses 3D printed dividers and holders to physically isolate instruments, reducing collision and friction during transport.

However, existing methods lack flexible adaptivity, leading to irreversible detail loss and context fragmentation. To resolve this, we propose FreshMem, a Frequency-Space Hybrid Memory network inspired by the brain's logarithmic perception and memory consolidation. FreshMem reconciles short-term fidelity with long-term coherence through two synergistic modules: Multi-scale Frequency Memory (MFM), which projects overflowing frames into representative frequency coefficients, complemented by residual details to reconstruct a global historical \"gist\"; and Space Thumbnail Memory (STM), which discretizes the continuous stream into episodic clusters by employing an adaptive compression strategy to distill them into high-density space thumbnails. Extensive experiments show that FreshMem significantly boosts the Qwen2-VL baseline, yielding gains of 5.20%, 4.52%, and 2.34% on StreamingBench, OV-Bench, and OVO-Bench, respectively.

Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion.

While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images.

BBPE16 preserves BBPE's language-agnostic properties while substantially improving cross-lingual token sharing. Across monolingual, bilingual, and trilingual ASR, and in a multilingual continual-learning setup, BBPE16 attains comparable or better accuracy; for Chinese, it reduces token counts by up to 10.4% and lowers decoding iterations by up to 10.3%.

Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning.

In practical auditing scenarios, due to the protection of intellectual property and commercial confidentiality, auditors are typically unable to access model parameters, rendering existing white-box or query-intensive detection methods impractical. More importantly, even after the backdoor is detected, existing detoxification approaches are often trapped in a dilemma between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality.\n  In this work, we identify a previously unreported phenomenon called temporal noise unconsistency, where the noise predictions between adjacent diffusion timesteps is disrupted in specific temporal segments when the input is triggered, while remaining stable under clean inputs. Leveraging this finding, we propose Temporal Noise Consistency Defense (TNC-Defense), a unified framework for backdoor detection and detoxification. The framework first uses the adjacent timestep noise consistency to design a gray-box detection module, for identifying and locating anomalous diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, the framework uses the identified anomalous timesteps to construct a trigger-agnostic, timestep-aware detoxification module, which directly corrects the backdoor generation path. This effectively suppresses backdoor behavior while significantly reducing detoxification costs.\n  We evaluate the proposed method under five representative backdoor attack scenarios and compare it with state-of-the-art defenses.

Existing approaches mainly either verbalize graphs into natural language, which leads to excessive token consumption and scattered attention, or transform graphs into trainable continuous embeddings (i.e., soft prompt), but exhibit severe misalignment with original text tokens. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate one special token <SOG_k> to fully represent the Structure Of Graph within a unified token space, facilitating explicit topology input and structural information sharing. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware structural tokenizer that maps each graph topology into a highly selective single token. Afterwards, we construct a set of hybrid structure Question-Answering corpora to align new structural tokens with existing text tokens. With this approach, <SOG_k> empowers LLMs to understand, generate, and reason in a concise and accurate manner.

Existing audio-visual fusion approaches face a fundamental trade-off: attention-based methods effectively model cross-modal relationships but incur quadratic computational complexity that prevents hierarchical, multi-scale architectures, while efficient fusion strategies rely on simplistic concatenation that fails to extract complementary cross-modal information. We introduce CMQKA, a novel cross-modal fusion mechanism that achieves linear O(N) complexity through efficient binary operations, enabling scalable hierarchical fusion previously infeasible with conventional attention. CMQKA employs bidirectional cross-modal Query-Key attention to extract complementary spatiotemporal features and uses learnable residual fusion to preserve modality-specific characteristics while enriching representations with cross-modal information. Building upon CMQKA, we present SNNergy, an energy-efficient multimodal fusion framework with a hierarchical architecture that processes inputs through progressively decreasing spatial resolutions and increasing semantic abstraction. This multi-scale fusion capability allows the framework to capture both local patterns and global context across modalities. Implemented with event-driven binary spike operations, SNNergy achieves remarkable energy efficiency while maintaining fusion effectiveness and establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging audio-visual benchmarks, including CREMA-D, AVE, and UrbanSound8K-AV, significantly outperforming existing multimodal fusion baselines.

Current defenses typically face a critical trade-off: prevention-based fine-tuning often degrades general utility via the \"alignment tax\", while detection-based filtering incurs prohibitive latency and memory costs. To bridge this gap, we propose RedVisor, a unified framework that synthesizes the explainability of detection systems with the seamless integration of prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, RedVisor is the first approach to leverage fine-grained reasoning paths to simultaneously detect attacks and guide the model's safe response. We implement this via a lightweight, removable adapter positioned atop the frozen backbone. This adapter serves a dual function: it first generates an explainable analysis that precisely localizes the injection and articulates the threat, which then explicitly conditions the model to reject the malicious command. Uniquely, the adapter is active only during this reasoning phase and is effectively muted during the subsequent response generation. This architecture yields two distinct advantages: (1) it mathematically preserves the backbone's original utility on benign inputs; and (2) it enables a novel KV Cache Reuse strategy, eliminating the redundant prefill computation inherent to decoupled pipelines. We further pioneer the integration of this defense into the vLLM serving engine with custom kernels.

However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models.

In this work, we propose a unified agentic NetGPT framework for AI-native xG networks, wherein a NetGPT core can either perform autonomous reasoning or delegate sub-tasks to domain-specialized agents via agentic communication. The framework establishes clear modular responsibilities and interoperable workflows, enabling scalable, distributed intelligence across the network. To support continual refinement of collaborative reasoning strategies, the framework is further enhanced through Agentic reinforcement learning under partially observable conditions and stochastic external states. The training pipeline incorporates masked loss against external agent uncertainty, entropy-guided exploration, and multi-objective rewards that jointly capture task quality, coordination efficiency, and resource constraints. Through this process, NetGPT learns when and how to collaborate, effectively balancing internal reasoning with agent invocation.

However, existing methods require known physical properties as supervision or inputs, limiting their applicability under unknown conditions. To explore this challenge, we introduce Cloth Dynamics Grounding (CDG), a novel scenario for unsupervised learning of cloth dynamics from multi-view visual observations. We further propose Cloth Dynamics Splatting (CloDS), an unsupervised dynamic learning framework designed for CDG. CloDS adopts a three-stage pipeline that first performs video-to-geometry grounding and then trains a dynamics model on the grounded meshes. To cope with large non-linear deformations and severe self-occlusions during grounding, we introduce a dual-position opacity modulation that supports bidirectional mapping between 2D observations and 3D geometry via mesh-based Gaussian splatting in video-to-geometry grounding stage. It jointly considers the absolute and relative position of Gaussian components. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CloDS effectively learns cloth dynamics from visual data while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen configurations.

However, existing long-term dialogue benchmarks primarily focus on static and explicit fact retrieval, failing to evaluate agents in critical scenarios where user information is dispersed, implicit, and continuously evolving. To address this gap, we introduce ES-MemEval, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates five core memory capabilities: information extraction, temporal reasoning, conflict detection, abstention, and user modeling, in long-term emotional support settings, covering question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation tasks. To support the benchmark, we also propose EvoEmo, a multi-session dataset for personalized long-term emotional support that captures fragmented, implicit user disclosures and evolving user states. Extensive experiments on open-source long-context, commercial, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) LLMs show that explicit long-term memory is essential for reducing hallucinations and enabling effective personalization. At the same time, RAG improves factual consistency but struggles with temporal dynamics and evolving user states.

We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic concepts and their spatial distributions. This disentanglement allows us to perform DINO-style augmentation alignment on the semantic tokens while maintaining the precise spatial mapping in the localization matrix necessary for pixel-level reconstruction. We demonstrate that as few as 16 sparse tokens under this factorized form are sufficient to simultaneously support high-quality reconstruction (2.60 FID) and match the semantic performance of dense backbones (79.10% ImageNet accuracy).

Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead.

We reflect on the visual occlusion issue and identify its essence as the absence of information useful for task completion. Inspired by this, we come up with the more fundamental problem of Exploratory and Focused Manipulation (EFM). The proposed problem is about actively collecting information to complete challenging manipulation tasks that require exploration or focus. As an initial attempt to address this problem, we establish the EFM-10 benchmark that consists of 4 categories of tasks that align with our definition (10 tasks in total). We further come up with a Bimanual Active Perception (BAP) strategy, which leverages one arm to provide active vision and another arm to provide force sensing while manipulating. Based on this idea, we collect a dataset named BAPData for the tasks in EFM-10. With the dataset, we successfully verify the effectiveness of the BAP strategy in an imitation learning manner. We hope that the EFM-10 benchmark along with the BAP strategy can become a cornerstone that facilitates future research towards this direction.

Despite recent efforts to analyze the convergence behavior of parameter estimation in this model, there are still two unresolved problems in the literature. First, the contaminated MoE model has been studied solely in regression settings, while its theoretical foundation in classification settings remains absent. Second, previous works on MoE models for classification capture pointwise convergence rates for parameter estimation without any guaranty of minimax optimality. In this work, we close these gaps by performing, for the first time, the convergence analysis of a contaminated mixture of multinomial logistic experts with homogeneous and heterogeneous structures, respectively. In each regime, we characterize uniform convergence rates for estimating parameters under challenging settings where ground-truth parameters vary with the sample size. Furthermore, we also establish corresponding minimax lower bounds to ensure that these rates are minimax optimal.

As a result, the cybersecurity risk landscape is changing in fundamental ways. Agentic AI systems can plan, act, collaborate, and persist over time, functioning as participants in complex socio-technical ecosystems rather than as isolated software components. Although recent work has strengthened defenses against model and pipeline level vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, data poisoning, and tool misuse, these system centric approaches may fail to capture risks that arise from autonomy, interaction, and emergent behavior. This article introduces the 4C Framework for multi-agent AI security, inspired by societal governance. It organizes agentic risks across four interdependent dimensions: Core (system, infrastructure, and environmental integrity), Connection (communication, coordination, and trust), Cognition (belief, goal, and reasoning integrity), and Compliance (ethical, legal, and institutional governance). By shifting AI security from a narrow focus on system-centric protection to the broader preservation of behavioral integrity and intent, the framework complements existing AI security strategies and offers a principled foundation for building agentic AI systems that are trustworthy, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa4C\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u4ece\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8d70\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u65b0\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u793e\u4f1a\u6cbb\u7406\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa4C\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u6838\u5fc3\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u56db\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee3\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5c06AI\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4fdd\u62a4\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709AI\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, these methods suffer from a \"Static Graph Fallacy\": they rely on fixed transition probabilities determined during indexing. This rigidity ignores the query-dependent nature of edge relevance, causing semantic drift where random walks are diverted into high-degree \"hub\" nodes before reaching critical downstream evidence. Consequently, models often achieve high partial recall but fail to retrieve the complete evidence chain required for multi-hop queries. To address this, we propose CatRAG, Context-Aware Traversal for robust RAG, a framework that builds on the HippoRAG 2 architecture and transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. We introduce a multi-faceted framework to steer the random walk: (1) Symbolic Anchoring, which injects weak entity constraints to regularize the random walk; (2) Query-Aware Dynamic Edge Weighting, which dynamically modulates graph structure, to prune irrelevant paths while amplifying those aligned with the query's intent; and (3) Key-Fact Passage Weight Enhancement, a cost-efficient bias that structurally anchors the random walk to likely evidence. Experiments across four multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that CatRAG consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our analysis reveals that while standard Recall metrics show modest gains, CatRAG achieves substantial improvements in reasoning completeness, the capacity to recover the entire evidence path without gaps. These results reveal that our approach effectively bridges the gap between retrieving partial context and enabling fully grounded reasoning.

Code: https://github.com/muliyangm/AIGI-Det-Calib", "summary": "Despite being trained on balanced datasets, existing AI-generated image detectors often exhibit systematic bias at test time, frequently misclassifying fake images as real. We hypothesize that this behavior stems from distributional shift in fake samples and implicit priors learned during training. Specifically, models tend to overfit to superficial artifacts that do not generalize well across different generation methods, leading to a misaligned decision threshold when faced with test-time distribution shift. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded post-hoc calibration framework based on Bayesian decision theory. In particular, we introduce a learnable scalar correction to the model's logits, optimized on a small validation set from the target distribution while keeping the backbone frozen.

However, the low resolution and speckle noise inherent to ultrasound images hinder diagnostic reliability, prompting the use of large convolutional neural networks that are difficult to deploy in routine clinical settings. In this work, we propose CortiNet, a lightweight, cortical-inspired dual-stream neural architecture for gallbladder disease diagnosis that integrates physically interpretable multi-scale signal decomposition with perception-driven feature learning. Inspired by parallel processing pathways in the human visual cortex, CortiNet explicitly separates low-frequency structural information from high-frequency perceptual details and processes them through specialized encoding streams. By operating directly on structured, frequency-selective representations rather than raw pixel intensities, the architecture embeds strong physics-based inductive bias, enabling efficient feature learning with a significantly reduced parameter footprint. A late-stage cortical-style fusion mechanism integrates complementary structural and textural cues while preserving computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose a structure-aware explainability framework wherein gradient-weighted class activation mapping is only applied to the structural branch of the proposed CortiNet architecture. This choice allows the model to only focus on the structural features, making it robust against speckle noise. We evaluate CortiNet on 10,692 expert-annotated images spanning nine clinically relevant gallbladder disease categories.

Although deep neural networks provide flexible nonparametric estimators, unconstrained empirical risk minimization often leads to unstable solutions and poor generalization. In this work, image segmentation is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem that integrates physically motivated priors into deep learning models through variational regularization. The proposed framework minimizes a composite objective function consisting of a data fidelity term and penalty terms derived from reaction-diffusion equations and phase-field interface energies, all implemented as differentiable residual losses. Experiments are conducted on the LIVECell dataset, a high-quality, manually annotated collection of phase-contrast microscopy images. Training is performed on two cell types, while evaluation is carried out on a distinct, unseen cell type to assess generalization. A UNet architecture is used as the unconstrained baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy and boundary fidelity compared to unconstrained deep learning baselines. Moreover, the PDE-regularized models exhibit enhanced stability and improved generalization in low-sample regimes, highlighting the advantages of incorporating structured priors.

Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

While recent advances have extended TPPs to handle textual information, existing approaches are limited in their ability to generate rich, multimodal content and reason about event dynamics. A key challenge is that incorporating multimodal data dramatically increases sequence length, hindering the ability of attention-based models to generate coherent, long-form textual descriptions that require long-range understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that extends LLM-based TPPs to the visual modality, positioning text generation as a core capability alongside time and type prediction. Our approach addresses the long-context problem through an adaptive sequence compression mechanism based on temporal similarity, which reduces sequence length while preserving essential patterns. We employ a two-stage paradigm of pre-training on compressed sequences followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks.

Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \\emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\\rightarrow$ outputs $\\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions.

However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u503czT\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u70ed\u7535\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u9ad8zT\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u70ed\u7535\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8ePCA\u7684\u62c6\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548ck-\u6700\u4f73\u7279\u5f81\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u7528SISSO\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u83b7\u5f97\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff1b\u7528SHAP\u548cSISSO\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u6210\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9aA\u4f4d\u63ba\u6742\u6d53\u5ea6\u3001A\u4f4d\u6c7d\u5316\u70ed\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u662fzT\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8zT\u5019\u9009\u65b0\u6210\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u70ed\u7535\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

RAG targets large, heterogeneous corpora where retrieved passages are diverse, whereas agent memory is a bounded, coherent dialogue stream with highly correlated spans that are often duplicates. Under this shift, fixed top-$k$ similarity retrieval tends to return redundant context, and post-hoc pruning can delete temporally linked prerequisites needed for correct reasoning. We argue retrieval should move beyond similarity matching and instead operate over latent components, following decoupling to aggregation: disentangle memories into semantic components, organise them into a hierarchy, and use this structure to drive retrieval. We propose xMemory, which builds a hierarchy of intact units and maintains a searchable yet faithful high-level node organisation via a sparsity--semantics objective that guides memory split and merge. At inference, xMemory retrieves top-down, selecting a compact, diverse set of themes and semantics for multi-fact queries, and expanding to episodes and raw messages only when it reduces the reader's uncertainty.

Inspired by this principle, we address Context-Entangled Content Segmentation (CECS), a challenging setting where objects share intrinsic visual patterns with their surroundings, as in camouflaged object detection. Conventional segmentation networks predominantly rely on architectural enhancements but often ignore the learning dynamics that govern robustness under entangled data distributions. We introduce CurriSeg, a dual-phase learning framework that unifies curriculum and anti-curriculum principles to improve representation reliability. In the Curriculum Selection phase, CurriSeg dynamically selects training data based on the temporal statistics of sample losses, distinguishing hard-but-informative samples from noisy or ambiguous ones, thus enabling stable capability enhancement. In the Anti-Curriculum Promotion phase, we design Spectral-Blindness Fine-Tuning, which suppresses high-frequency components to enforce dependence on low-frequency structural and contextual cues and thus strengthens generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CurriSeg achieves consistent improvements across diverse CECS benchmarks without adding parameters or increasing total training time, offering a principled view of how progression and challenge interplay to foster robust and context-aware segmentation.

This leads to suboptimal performance for specific groups, limiting targeted marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present \\textit{One Size, Many Fits} (OSMF), a unified framework that aligns diverse group-wise click preferences in large-scale advertising image generation. OSMF begins with product-aware adaptive grouping, which dynamically organizes users based on their attributes and product characteristics, representing each group with rich collective preference features. Building on these groups, preference-conditioned image generation employs a Group-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (G-MLLM) to generate tailored images for each group. The G-MLLM is pre-trained to simultaneously comprehend group features and generate advertising images. Subsequently, we fine-tune the G-MLLM using our proposed Group-DPO for group-wise preference alignment, which effectively enhances each group's CTR on the generated images. To further advance this field, we introduce the Grouped Advertising Image Preference Dataset (GAIP), the first large-scale public dataset of group-wise image preferences, including around 600K groups built from 40M users.

In this work, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that the sink in Vanilla Attention and Sink Attention naturally construct a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism within attention layers.

Disentangling the visual and linguistic roots of these failures is a fundamental challenge for robust evaluation. To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., \"a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background\") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., \"In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle\"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel \"Confusion Benchmark\" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter.

Recent work mainly focused on improving answer accuracy via fine-tuning and structured or reinforcement-based optimization. However, reliable reasoning in response generation faces three challenges: 1) Reasoning Collapse. Reasoning in multi-hop QA is inherently complex due to multi-hop composition and is further destabilized by noisy retrieval. 2) Reasoning-answer inconsistency. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of LLM generation and exposure to evidence--distractor mixtures, models may produce correct answers that are not faithfully supported by their intermediate reasoning or evidence. 3) Loss of format control. Traditional chain-of-thought generation often deviates from required structured output formats, leading to incomplete or malformed structured content. To address these challenges, we propose CRAFT (Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces), a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning framework that trains models to perform faithful reasoning during response generation. CRAFT employs dual reward mechanisms to optimize multi-hop reasoning: deterministic rewards ensure structural correctness while judge-based rewards verify semantic faithfulness. This optimization framework supports controllable trace variants that enable systematic analysis of how structure and scale affect reasoning performance and faithfulness. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks show that CRAFT improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across model scales, with the CRAFT 7B model achieving competitive performance with closed-source LLMs across multiple reasoning trace settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51faRAG\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCRAFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5d29\u6e83\u3001\u63a8\u7406 - \u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u4e22\u5931\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6CRAFT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCRAFT\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0cCRAFT 7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CRAFT\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, most eHMI studies rely on developer-crafted message-action pairs, which are difficult to adapt to diverse and dynamic traffic contexts. A promising alternative is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as action designers that generate context-conditioned eHMI actions, yet such designers lack perceptual verification and typically depend on fixed prompts or costly human-annotated feedback for improvement. We present See2Refine, a human-free, closed-loop framework that uses vision-language model (VLM) perceptual evaluation as automated visual feedback to improve an LLM-based eHMI action designer. Given a driving context and a candidate eHMI action, the VLM evaluates the perceived appropriateness of the action, and this feedback is used to iteratively revise the designer's outputs, enabling systematic refinement without human supervision. We evaluate our framework across three eHMI modalities (lightbar, eyes, and arm) and multiple LLM model sizes. Across settings, our framework consistently outperforms prompt-only LLM designers and manually specified baselines in both VLM-based metrics and human-subject evaluations.

Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis.

The resulting objectives are amenable to cyclic Kullback-Leibler (KL) Bregman projections, with the classical Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal transport (balanced, unbalanced, gradient flows, barycenters, \\dots) as the canonical example. Assuming uniformly bounded primal mass and dual radius, we prove that the dual objective of these KL projections decreases at an $O(1/k)$ rate with a constant that scales only linearly in $1/\u03b3$, where $\u03b3$ is the entropic regularization parameter. This extends the guarantees known for entropic optimal transport to any such linearly constrained problem. Following the terminology introduced in [Chizat et al 2025], we call such rates \"robust\", because this mild dependence on $\u03b3$ underpins favorable complexity bounds for approximating the unregularized problem via alternating KL projections. The crucial aspect of the analysis is that the dual radius should be measured according to a block-quotient dual seminorm, which depends on the structure of the split of the constraint into blocks. As an application, we derive the flow-Sinkhorn algorithm for the Wasserstein-1 distance on graphs.

However, the exploration of ML in fluid dynamics is critically hampered by the scarcity of large, diverse, and high-fidelity datasets suitable for training robust models. This limitation is particularly acute for highly turbulent flows, which dominate practical engineering applications yet remain computationally prohibitive to simulate at scale. High-Reynolds number turbulent datasets are essential for ML models to learn the complex, multi-scale physics characteristic of real-world flows, enabling generalisation beyond the simplified, low-Reynolds number regimes often represented in existing datasets. This paper introduces WAKESET, a novel, large-scale CFD dataset of highly turbulent flows, designed to address this critical gap. The dataset captures the complex hydrodynamic interactions during the underwater recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle by a larger extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle.

Standard models that optimize pixel-wise losses are prone to regression-to-the-mean bias, which blurs extreme values. Existing Fourier-based methods also lack the spatial localization needed to resolve transient convective cells. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose WADEPre, a wavelet-based decomposition model for extreme precipitation that transitions the modeling into the wavelet domain. By leveraging the Discrete Wavelet Transform for explicit decomposition, WADEPre employs a dual-branch architecture: an Approximation Network to model stable, low-frequency advection, isolating deterministic trends from statistical bias, and a spatially localized Detail Network to capture high-frequency stochastic convection, resolving transient singularities and preserving sharp boundaries. A subsequent Refiner module then dynamically reconstructs these decoupled multi-scale components into the final high-fidelity forecast. To address optimization instability, we introduce a multi-scale curriculum learning strategy that progressively shifts supervision from coarse scales to fine-grained details. Extensive experiments on the SEVIR and Shanghai Radar datasets demonstrate that WADEPre achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant improvements in capturing extreme thresholds and maintaining structural fidelity.

In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting, where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore.\n  Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training.

Our approach is based on generative inverse sampling, where we model clean speech and ambient noise with dedicated diffusion priors and jointly leverage them to recover all underlying sources. To achieve this, we reformulate a recent inverse sampler to match our setting. We evaluate on mixtures of 1, 2, and 3 speakers with noise and show that, despite being entirely unsupervised, our method consistently outperforms leading supervised baselines in \\ac{WER} across all conditions. We further extend our framework to handle off-screen speaker separation. Moreover, the high fidelity of the separated noise component makes it suitable for downstream acoustic scene detection.

Detecting adverse effects at an early stage is critical to reduce attrition and accelerate the development of safe medicines. Histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for toxicity assessment, but it relies heavily on expert pathologists, creating a bottleneck for large-scale screening. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-based anomaly detection framework for histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) in rodent livers from toxicology studies. The system identifies healthy tissue and known pathologies (anomalies) for which training data is available. In addition, it can detect rare pathologies without training data as out-of-distribution (OOD) findings. We generate a novel dataset of pixelwise annotations of healthy tissue and known pathologies and use this data to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in order to do tissue segmentation. Finally, we extract features for OOD detection using the Mahalanobis distance. To better account for class-dependent variability in histological data, we propose the use of class-specific thresholds. We optimize the thresholds using the mean of the false negative and false positive rates, resulting in only 0.16\\% of pathological tissue classified as healthy and 0.35\\% of healthy tissue classified as pathological. Applied to mouse liver WSIs with known toxicological findings, the framework accurately detects anomalies, including rare OOD morphologies.

Given a set of vision tokens-such as images, point clouds, videos, or event camera streams-our objective is to encode their positions while accounting for the characteristics of vision modalities. Prior works have largely extended position encodings from 1D-sequences in language to nD-structures in vision, but only with partial account of vision characteristics. We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets. Extrapolation experiments on ImageNet-1K show that PaPE extrapolates remarkably well, improving in absolute terms by up to 10.5% over the next-best position encoding.

We study this phenomenon through the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) of a policy-gradient estimator, defined as the estimator variance (noise) normalized by the squared norm of the true gradient (signal). Our main result is that, for (i) finite-horizon linear systems with Gaussian policies and linear state-feedback, and (ii) finite-horizon polynomial systems with Gaussian policies and polynomial feedback, the NSR of the REINFORCE estimator can be characterized exactly-either in closed form or via numerical moment-evaluation algorithms-without approximation. For general nonlinear dynamics and expressive policies (including neural policies), we further derive a general upper bound on the variance. These characterizations enable a direct examination of how NSR varies across policy parameters and how it evolves along optimization trajectories (e.g. SGD and Adam). Across a range of examples, we find that the NSR landscape is highly non-uniform and typically increases as the policy approaches an optimum; in some regimes it blows up, which can trigger training instability and policy collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u6bd4\uff08NSR\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753bNSR\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e00\u822c\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0NSR\u666f\u89c2\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u53d8\u6162\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684NSR\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753bNSR\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753bNSR\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff1bNSR\u666f\u89c2\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "NSR\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8NSR\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

In safety-critical and regulated domains such as finance, these mechanisms must satisfy strict formal requirements, remain auditable, and operate within explicitly bounded limits. Coordination logic therefore functions as a governance layer rather than an optimization heuristic.\n  This paper presents an exploratory systems feasibility study of Self-Evolving Coordination Protocols (SECP): coordination protocols that permit limited, externally validated self-modification while preserving fixed formal invariants. We study a controlled proof-of-concept setting in which six fixed Byzantine consensus protocol proposals are evaluated by six specialized decision modules. All coordination regimes operate under identical hard constraints, including Byzantine fault tolerance (f < n/3), O(n2) message complexity, complete non-statistical safety and liveness arguments, and bounded explainability.\n  Four coordination regimes are compared in a single-shot design: unanimous hard veto, weighted scalar aggregation, SECP v1.0 (an agent-designed non-scalar protocol), and SECP v2.0 (the result of one governed modification). Outcomes are evaluated using a single metric, proposal coverage, defined as the number of proposals accepted. A single recursive modification increased coverage from two to three accepted proposals while preserving all declared invariants.\n  The study makes no claims regarding statistical significance, optimality, convergence, or learning. Its contribution is architectural: it demonstrates that bounded self-modification of coordination protocols is technically implementable, auditable, and analyzable under explicit formal constraints, establishing a foundation for governed multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u534f\u8bae\uff08SECP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56db\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u9012\u5f52\u4fee\u6539\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0b\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u63d0\u6848\u63a5\u53d7\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d7\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u548c\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u5f62\u5f0f\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e14\u5728\u660e\u786e\u754c\u9650\u5185\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u63a7\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56db\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u63d0\u6848\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6b21\u9012\u5f52\u4fee\u6539\u4f7f\u63d0\u6848\u63a5\u53d7\u6570\u91cf\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u6709\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d7\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The purpose of the project was to explore the effectiveness and efficiency of machine learning techniques for the task of binary classification (i.e., benign or malicious) as well as multi-class classification to further include three malware sub-types (i.e., benign, ransomware, spyware, or Trojan horse). The XGBoost model type was the final model selected for both tasks due to the trade-off between strong detection capability and fast inference speed. The binary classifier achieved a testing subset accuracy and F1 score of 99.98\\%, while the multi-class version reached an accuracy of 87.54\\% and an F1 score of 81.26\\%, with an average F1 score over the malware sub-types of 75.03\\%. In addition to the high modelling performance, XGBoost is also efficient in terms of classification speed. It takes about 37.3 milliseconds to classify 50 samples in sequential order in the binary setting and about 43.2 milliseconds in the multi-class setting.

Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware.

However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios.

Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics.

We argue that this formulation requires re-examination as it assumes uniform risk across all malicious queries, neglecting Execution Likelihood--the conditional probability of a threat being realized given the model's response. In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them \"blind\" to this critical dimension of risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u671f\u5371\u5bb3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9006\u5411\u98ce\u9669\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u627e\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\u6839\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u671f\u5371\u5bb3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u8d8a\u72f1\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5931\u8d25\u6839\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9006\u5411\u98ce\u9669\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5373\u5bf9\u4f4e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff08\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff09\u5a01\u80c1\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff08\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u4f46\u65e0\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u8868\u793a\u800c\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u201c\u5931\u660e\u201d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

However, evaluating softmax, a core component of transformer architectures, remains particularly challenging in HE due to its multivariate structure, the large dynamic range induced by exponential functions, and the need for accurate division during normalization. In this paper, we propose MGF-softmax, a novel softmax reformulation based on the moment generating function (MGF) that replaces the softmax denominator with its moment-based counterpart. This reformulation substantially reduces multiplicative depth while preserving key properties of softmax and asymptotically converging to the exact softmax as the number of input tokens increases. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers and large language models show that MGF-softmax provides an efficient and accurate approximation of softmax in encrypted inference.

Empirically, the final-layer posterior of post-trained LRMs exhibit sharply reduced entropy, while the entropy of intermediate layers remains relatively high. Motivated by this entropy asymmetry, we propose Latent Exploration Decoding (LED), a depth-conditioned decoding strategy. LED aggregates intermediate posteriors via cumulative sum and selects depth configurations with maximal entropy as exploration candidates. Without additional training or parameters, LED consistently improves pass@1 and pass@16 accuracy by 0.61 and 1.03 percentage points across multiple reasoning benchmarks and models.

This task becomes particularly important yet more challenging when the target domain is previously unseen (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak or the Russia-Ukraine war). However, existing CD-FND methods overlook such scenarios and consequently suffer from the following two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of high-level semantics in news and user engagements; and (2) scarcity of labeled data in unseen domains. Targeting these limitations, we find that large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for CD-FND on unseen domains, yet their effective use remains non-trivial. Nevertheless, two key challenges arise: (1) how to capture high-level semantics from both news content and user engagements using LLMs; and (2) how to make LLM-generated features more reliable and transferable for CD-FND on unseen domains. To tackle these challenges, we propose DAUD, a novel LLM-Based Domain-Aware framework for fake news detection on Unseen Domains. DAUD employs LLMs to extract high-level semantics from news content. It models users' single- and cross-domain engagements to generate domain-aware behavioral representations. In addition, DAUD captures the relations between original data-driven features and LLM-derived features of news, users, and user engagements. This allows it to extract more reliable domain-shared representations that improve knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DAUD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both general and unseen-domain CD-FND settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDAUD\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAUD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u65b0\u95fb\u5185\u5bb9\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u5355\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u53c2\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884d\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAUD\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "DAUD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Although traditional TS generation methods are computationally expensive, recent generative modeling approaches have enabled chemically meaningful TS prediction for relatively small molecules. However, these methods fail to generalize to practically relevant reaction substrates because of distribution shifts induced by increasing molecular sizes. Furthermore, TS geometries for larger molecules are not available at scale, making it infeasible to train generative models from scratch on such molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce FragmentFlow: a divide-and-conquer approach that trains a generative model to predict TS geometries for the reactive core atoms, which define the reaction mechanism. The full TS structure is then reconstructed by re-attaching substituent fragments to the predicted core. By operating on reactive cores, whose size and composition remain relatively invariant across molecular contexts, FragmentFlow mitigates distribution shifts in generative modeling. Evaluated on a new curated dataset of reactions involving reactants with up to 33 heavy atoms, FragmentFlow correctly identifies 90% of TSs while requiring 30% fewer saddle-point optimization steps than classical initialization schemes. These results point toward scalable TS generation for high-throughput reactivity studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u5e95\u7269\u3002\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86FragmentFlow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6307\u5411\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5206\u5b50\u5927\u5c0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u5e94\u5e95\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFragmentFlow\u5206\u6cbb\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e49\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u53d6\u4ee3\u57fa\u7247\u6bb5\u91cd\u65b0\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u91cd\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6574\u7406\u7684\u6d89\u53ca\u6700\u591a33\u4e2a\u91cd\u539f\u5b50\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFragmentFlow\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b90%\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\uff0c\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6240\u9700\u7684\u978d\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c1130%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u6307\u5411\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

To overcome the architectural limitations, we introduce the Physics-Informed Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator (CPNO), a novel mesh-free framework that leverages a basis transformation to replace unstable monomial expansions with the numerically stable Chebyshev spectral basis. By integrating parameter dependent modulation mechanism to main net, CPNO constructs PDE solutions in a near-optimal functional space, decoupling the model from MLP-specific constraints and enhancing multi-scale representation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the Chebyshev basis's near-minimax uniform approximation properties and superior conditioning, with Lebesgue constants growing logarithmically with degree, thereby mitigating spectral bias and ensuring stable gradient flow during optimization.

Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks. However, the substantial cost of human annotation makes it infeasible to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets of structure-grounded descriptions. In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\\%$.

Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams.

However, in real-world settings, the extreme scarcity of labeled data severely limits the development and practical adoption of robust AES systems. This study proposes a novel approach to enhance AES performance in both limited-data and full-data settings by introducing three key techniques. First, we introduce a Two-Stage fine-tuning strategy that leverages low-rank adaptations to better adapt an AES model to target prompt essays. Second, we introduce a Score Alignment technique to improve consistency between predicted and true score distributions. Third, we employ uncertainty-aware self-training using unlabeled data, effectively expanding the training set with pseudo-labeled samples while mitigating label noise propagation.

We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer.

To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss with codebook learning to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles.

Existing paradigms face a fundamental trade-off: optimization-based methods require computationally prohibitive queries, while alignment-based approaches hinge on the unrealistic assumption of accessible in-domain training data. These constraints render them ineffective in strict black-box and cross-domain settings. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce Zero2Text, a novel training-free framework based on recursive online alignment. Unlike methods relying on static datasets, Zero2Text synergizes LLM priors with a dynamic ridge regression mechanism to iteratively align generation to the target embedding on-the-fly. We further demonstrate that standard defenses, such as differential privacy, fail to effectively mitigate this adaptive threat. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate Zero2Text; notably, on MS MARCO against the OpenAI victim model, it achieves 1.8x higher ROUGE-L and 6.4x higher BLEU-2 scores compared to baselines, recovering sentences from unknown domains without a single leaked data pair.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6Zero2Text\u5e94\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5d4c\u5165\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u5904\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9ed1\u76d2\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6Zero2Text\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Zero2Text\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728MS MARCO\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u672a\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u53e5\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u9632\u5fa1\u5982\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5a01\u80c1\uff0cZero2Text\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u89e3\u51b3\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

We discuss how symmetries and conservation laws reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of physical datasets, and how this reduction may manifest itself through self-organization of latent spaces in generative models trained to balance reconstruction and compression.

A prototype should be produced when the expected improvement is high and the cost is low. However, this is hard to decide, because costs can vary drastically: a simple parameter tweak may take seconds, while fabricating hardware consumes material and energy. Such asymmetries, can discourage a designer from exploring the design space. In this paper, we present an extension of cost-aware Bayesian optimization to account for diverse prototyping costs. The method builds on the power of Bayesian optimization and requires only a minimal modification to the acquisition function. The key idea is to use designer-estimated costs to guide sampling toward more cost-effective prototypes. In technical evaluations, the method achieved comparable utility to a cost-agnostic baseline while requiring only ${\\approx}70\\%$ of the cost; under strict budgets, it outperformed the baseline threefold. A within-subjects study with 12 participants in a realistic joystick design task demonstrated similar benefits.

This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers.

Low-friction assistants can become sycophantic, baking in implicit assumptions and pushing verification costs onto experts, while outcomes arrive too late to serve as reward signals. In deep-uncertainty decisions (where objectives are contested and reversals are costly), scaling fluent agreement amplifies poor commitments faster than it builds expertise. We argue reliable human-AI partnership requires a shift from answer generation to collaborative premise governance over a knowledge substrate, negotiating only what is decision-critical. A discrepancy-driven control loop operates over this substrate: detecting conflicts, localizing misalignment via typed discrepancies (teleological, epistemic, procedural), and triggering bounded negotiation through decision slices.

Both paradigms rely on word embeddings not only to represent the input sentence, but also to represent the target sentence that backbone models are trained to predict. We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior.

To bridge this gap, we first introduce a Hierarchical Pose-free Memory Compressor (HPMC) that recursively distills historical latents into a fixed-budget representation. By jointly optimizing the compressor with the generative backbone, HPMC enables the model to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with bounded computational cost, eliminating the need for explicit geometric priors. Second, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Action Labeling module that discretizes continuous motion into a tri-state logic. This strategy maximizes the utilization of raw video data while shielding the deterministic action space from being corrupted by noisy trajectories, ensuring robust action-response learning. Furthermore, guided by insights from a pilot toy study, we employ a Revisit-Dense Finetuning Strategy using a compact, 30-minute dataset to efficiently activate the model's long-range loop-closure capabilities.

Equal contribution: Shaoheng Xu and Chunyi Sun", "summary": "Room impulse responses (RIRs) are essential for many acoustic signal processing tasks, yet measuring them densely across space is often impractical. In this work, we propose RIR-Former, a grid-free, one-step feed-forward model for RIR reconstruction. By introducing a sinusoidal encoding module into a transformer backbone, our method effectively incorporates microphone position information, enabling interpolation at arbitrary array locations.

Existing reconstruction methods, like transform-domain interpolation, often produce kinematic inconsistencies and amplitude distortions, while supervised deep learning approaches require complete ground-truth near-offset data that are unavailable in realistic acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised diffusion-based framework that reconstructs missing near-offset traces without requiring near-offset reference data. Our method leverages overlapping patch extraction with single-trace shifts from the available far-offset section to train a conditional diffusion model, which learns offset-dependent statistical patterns governing event curvature, amplitude variation, and wavelet characteristics. At inference, we perform trace-by-trace recursive extrapolation from the nearest recorded offset toward zero offset, progressively propagating learned prior information from far to near offsets. The generative formulation further provides uncertainty estimates via ensemble sampling, quantifying prediction confidence where validation data are absent. Controlled validation experiments on synthetic and field datasets show substantial performance gains over conventional parabolic Radon transform baselines. Operational deployment on actual near-offset gaps demonstrates practical viability where ground-truth validation is impossible.

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faWorld - Gymnast\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9VLA\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884cRL\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728Bridge\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e91\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u6f14\u793a\u4e0e\u5bb6\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u53d7\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0cSFT\u53d7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0cRL\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u53d7\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5426\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWorld - Gymnast\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c55\u5f00VLA\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884cRL\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u5c55\u5f00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bridge\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\uff0cWorld - Gymnast\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4SFT\u9ad818\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9ad82\u500d\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u8da3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4e91\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u7f29\u5c0f\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u5bb6\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

This bias persists even when models generate step-wise explanations, indicating that intermediate rationales may inherit the same semantic shortcuts that affect answers. Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics. We construct paired content-laden and abstract syllogisms and use the model's activations on abstract inputs to define an abstract reasoning space. We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass. Using cross-lingual transfer as a test bed, we show that abstraction-aligned steering reduces content-driven errors and improves validity-sensitive performance.

We propose a gated multi-head Transformer architecture based on Swin U-Net, augmented with inter-slice context integration and a parallel detection head, which jointly performs slice-level structure detection via a multi-layer perceptron and pixel-level segmentation through a context-enhanced stream. Detection outputs gate the segmentation predictions to suppress false positives in anatomically invalid slices, and training uses slice-wise Tversky loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive demonstrate that the gated model substantially outperforms a non-gated segmentation-only baseline, achieving a mean Dice loss of $0.013 \\pm 0.036$ versus $0.732 \\pm 0.314$, with detection probabilities strongly correlated with anatomical presence, effectively eliminating spurious segmentations. In contrast, the non-gated model exhibited higher variability and persistent false positives across all slices.

Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself.

However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79.

However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment.

This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments.

Over time, these models have evolved to capture more nuanced properties, such as the heterogeneity of relationships, leading to the concept of multilayer networks. However, the analysis and evaluation of methods for these structures is often hindered by the limited availability of large-scale empirical data. As a result, graph generators are commonly used as a workaround, albeit at the cost of introducing systematic biases. In this paper, we address the inverse-generator problem by inferring the configuration parameters of a multilayer network generator, mABCD, from a real-world system. Our goal is to identify parameter settings that enable the generator to produce synthetic networks that act as digital twins of the original structure. We propose a method for estimating matching configurations and for quantifying the associated error. Our results demonstrate that this task is non-trivial, as strong interdependencies between configuration parameters weaken independent estimation and instead favour a joint-prediction approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u9006\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u65ad\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u5668mABCD\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u5339\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u539f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u5339\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u975e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u95f4\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u524a\u5f31\u72ec\u7acb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6cd5\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u9006\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

Blaschko"], "title": "NAB: Neural Adaptive Binning for Sparse-View CT reconstruction", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in inspecting the internal structures of industrial objects. Furthermore, achieving high-quality CT reconstruction from sparse views is essential for reducing production costs. While classic implicit neural networks have shown promising results for sparse reconstruction, they are unable to leverage shape priors of objects. Motivated by the observation that numerous industrial objects exhibit rectangular structures, we propose a novel \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{B}inning (\\textbf{NAB}) method that effectively integrates rectangular priors into the reconstruction process. Specifically, our approach first maps coordinate space into a binned vector space. This mapping relies on an innovative binning mechanism based on differences between shifted hyperbolic tangent functions, with our extension enabling rotations around the input-plane normal vector. The resulting representations are then processed by a neural network to predict CT attenuation coefficients. This design enables end-to-end optimization of the encoding parameters -- including position, size, steepness, and rotation -- via gradient flow from the projection data, thus enhancing reconstruction accuracy. By adjusting the smoothness of the binning function, NAB can generalize to objects with more complex geometries. This research provides a new perspective on integrating shape priors into neural network-based reconstruction.

To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMultiBO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u7528\u6237\u5fc3\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u5fc3\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1MultiBO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210K\u4e2a\u65b0\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684K\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728B\u8f6e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u5185\u53ef\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c30\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u548c5\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9879\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Although recent generative approaches such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) have achieved promising results, they often satisfy only a subset of these requirements. To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165PRISM\u5355\u901a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eIMLE\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5168\u5c40\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5355\u901a\u7b56\u7565PRISM\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528Performer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPRISM\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad810 - 25%\uff0c\u5728CALVIN\u4e2d\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea625%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8f68\u8ff9\u6296\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8986\u76d6\u3002"}}

However, this task is highly dependent on the effort and intuition of the teacher. In this work, we present a novel approach for detecting misconceptions from student-tutor dialogues using large language models (LLMs). First, we use a fine-tuned LLM to generate plausible misconceptions, and then retrieve the most promising candidates among these using embedding similarity with the input dialogue. These candidates are then assessed and re-ranked by another fine-tuned LLM to improve misconception relevance. Empirically, we evaluate our system on real dialogues from an educational tutoring platform.

We propose an efficient \\emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \\(k\\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\\(k\\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \\(k\\) depends on the channel, with smaller \\(k\\) being better in noisy settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u7ebf\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e74\u9f84\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u7f18\u76f2\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528AgeTop - k\u9009\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u548ck\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u9001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\uff0c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u8f93\u53c2\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e74\u9f84\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u7f18\u76f2\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7528\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u5927\u6bd4\u5408\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7528AgeTop - k\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u5750\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u66f4\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5929\u7ebf\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff1bAgeTop - k\u5728\u8f83\u597d\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u6700\u4f18k\u503c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c0fk\u503c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u548ck\u503c\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To narrow this gap, we present HumanX, a full-stack framework that compiles human video into generalizable, real-world interaction skills for humanoids, without task-specific rewards. HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills. Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration.
