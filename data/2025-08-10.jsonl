Once a good\narrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be\nimmediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to\nensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.\nUnfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in\ngeneral, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.\n  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting\nalgorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction\nvector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine\nlearning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we\nmeasure their error using the total variation distance from the true\nvaluations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with\nthe true values.\n  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility\nresults even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore\npredictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both\nthe predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the\nprediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate\nEFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary\nto the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the\nnecessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with\nidentical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.\nThe algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy\nof the predictions increases."}

Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes the role of different factors, such as the JLT's dimension\nreduction ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, differential privacy parameters, sample\nsize and feature dimension, in shaping the privacy-power trade-off. Our\nanalysis is based on a novel `debiasing technique' for high-dimensional private\nknockoff procedure. We further establish sufficient conditions under which the\npower of the proposed procedure converges to one. This work bridges two\ncritical paradigms -- knockoff-based FDR control and private data release --\nenabling reliable variable selection in sensitive domains. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that structural privacy preservation through random projections\noutperforms the classical noise addition mechanism, maintaining statistical\npower even under strict privacy budgets."}

However, the parameter estimation of LMMs imposes substantial\ncomputational burdens due to large-scale operations on genetic similarity\nmatrices (GSM). We introduced the near-exact linear mixed model (NExt-LMM), a\nnovel LMM framework that overcomes critical computational bottlenecks in GWAS\nthrough the following key innovations. Firstly, we exploit the inherent\nlow-rank structure of the GSM iteratively with the Hierarchical Off-Diagonal\nLow-Rank (HODLR) format, which is much faster than traditional decomposition\nmethods. Secondly, we leverage the HODLR-approximated GSM to dramatically\naccelerate the further maximum likelihood estimation with the shared\nheritability ratios. Moreover, we establish rigorous error bounds for the\nNExt-LMM estimator, proving that Kullback-Leibler divergence between the\napproximated and exact estimators can be arbitrarily small. Consequently, our\nproposed dual approach accelerates inference of LMMs while guaranteeing low\napproximation errors. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate that the\nNExt-LMM significantly improves inference efficiency compared to existing\nmethods.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework\nbased on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability\nacross process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize\nexploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to\ndynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient\nheuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned\nsolely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5\noperational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology\nnodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a\nwidely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\\% of tasks\nwith more than 96.67\\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that\nEasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and\ncomputational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying\nthe analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later\ndate."}

The\ndataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over\na 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several\nadvantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple\ntypes of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich\nside information features for both users and streamers. These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive\ncan support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K\nrecommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift\nprice prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables\nresearch on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware\nrecommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at\nhttps://imgkkk574.github.io/KuaiLive."}

We take the first\nstep to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing\nadversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for\npoisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two\nrepresentative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.\n2024).

We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning\nframework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2\narchitecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a\nreal-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide\nimages from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates\nslide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful\nrepresentations than non-adversarial baselines.

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy.

Most of them overlooks the\ninteraction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the\nfunctionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional\narchitecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.\nInspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and\nfunctional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and\npropose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within\nLLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and\ndecompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional\nbrain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving\nthe key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate\nfunctional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/WhatAboutMyStar/LLM_ACTIVATION."}

These unique characteristics introduce new\nchallenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional\nrecommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in\nrecent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the\nlack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature\nof live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the\nfirst real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live\nstreaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The\ndataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over\na 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several\nadvantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple\ntypes of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich\nside information features for both users and streamers. These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive\ncan support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K\nrecommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift\nprice prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables\nresearch on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware\nrecommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at\nhttps://imgkkk574.github.io/KuaiLive."}

Linear Probes Can Uncover Persuasion Dynamics in Multi-Turn Conversations", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to\npersuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is\nlimited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient."}
