Historical evidence suggests that\nmonetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity\n-- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this\nvision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary\nmechanism for socio-technical control.

ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards\nand constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover,\nACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving\nthe policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test\ninstances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with\nseveral state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the\nvehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40\nunseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation\nfurther presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous\nablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of\nACERL."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on\nvisual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and\ngenerate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal\nreasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding\nand capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key\ncomponents, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch\nvalidation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue\nreport, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code\nresponsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into\nexecutable context for better fault comprehension.

We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M,\nand the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness.

While existing methods primarily\nfocus on developing model structures and building graphs for improved\nselection, pre-training strategies remain underexplored in this domain. Current\nstock series pre-training follows methods from other areas without adapting to\nthe unique characteristics of financial data, particularly overlooking\nstock-specific contextual information and the non-stationary nature of stock\nprices. Consequently, the latent statistical features inherent in stock data\nare underutilized. In this paper, we propose three novel pre-training tasks\ntailored to stock data characteristics: stock code classification, stock sector\nclassification, and moving average prediction. We develop the Stock Specialized\nPre-trained Transformer (SSPT) based on a two-layer transformer architecture.\nExtensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pre-training\nmethods and provide detailed guidance on their application. Evaluations on five\nstock datasets, including four markets and two time periods, demonstrate that\nSSPT consistently outperforms the market and existing methods in terms of both\ncumulative investment return ratio and Sharpe ratio.

As various blockchain networks continue to\nevolve, we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift in which they could provide\nservices traditionally offered by the Internet, but in a decentralized manner,\nmarking the emergence of the Internet of Blockchains. While significant\nprogress has been achieved in enabling interoperability between blockchain\nnetworks, existing solutions often assume that networks are already mutually\naware.

We also introduce a mechanism for discovering assets\nand services within a blockchain from external networks. Given the\ndecentralized nature of the proposed discovery architecture, we design an\nincentive mechanism to encourage nodes to actively participate in maintaining\nthe discovery network. The proposed architecture implemented and evaluated,\nusing the Substrate framework, demonstrates its resilience and scalability,\neffectively handling up to 130,000 concurrent requests under the tested network\nconfigurations, with a median response time of 5.5 milliseconds, demonstrating\nthe ability to scale its processing capacity further by increasing its network\nsize."}

Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies\nthrough a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we\ncan analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.\nThis analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised\nlearning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?\n  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training\nframework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela\nmodels semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token\nprediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch\nattention mechanism.

While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our\nfindings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future\ninvestigations into designing variable system prompts."}

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables\nefficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that\ndistributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a\nlightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that\nuses the existing computational resources inside the storage system.

While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their\ninterpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in\nAPIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples\nwhile minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context\nwindow for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to\nthe LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This\nconstraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning\nprompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs\ncontinue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,\nsoft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.\nFor instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these\nissues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that\nenables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently\ntransfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to\nderive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt\ntransferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential\nprivacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small\npublic dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,\npreserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts."}

Existing approaches that employ large,\npretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment\nrepresentations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate\nnoisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,\n$\\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL\nagents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder\nworks by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to\ncompleting a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to\nidentify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to\nrank them using pairwise comparisons.

Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with\nminimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,\nwhich is trained on unlabelled visual data.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese.

This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic\ninformation, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating\nthem to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning\napproach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath\nembeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the\ndistance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance\nbetween those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the\nseparability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also\noutlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML\npipeline."}

We achieve this through\na novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant\ncontext, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)\nisolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)\nleverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that\nproposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant\nfixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our\nmethodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark\nbeating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of\n7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.\nWe note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring\nmulti-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that\nincorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust\nand semantically consistent repairs."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

Beyond Equality of Opportunity", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "comment": "Accepted for presentation at ACM FAccT 2025; under final review\n  (minor revision) at an ACM journal", "summary": "Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of\nresearch. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also\noutlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML\npipeline."}

This work introduces a\nnovel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs),\nwhich incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the\ninput coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo\ndatasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials,\nsupervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares.

While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities\ntoward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.\nTraditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account\nfor crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to\nreduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use\nneural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity.

This method is highly\nparallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in\nneural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,\nadaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our\nreservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination\nfidelity.

Employing this approach enables\nsimultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while\nproviding a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto\n(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding\nto enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and\nfinite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nparticularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution\nis non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit\nerror rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for\nblock lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in\nreal-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and\npractical coding performance."}

To bridge this critical gap,\nwe propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive\nemergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We\nthus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive\nsafety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks\ninstantiated in a high-fidelity simulator.

Due to their strong image-text\nalignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with\nclear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in\nnatural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal\nbenchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly\non unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual\nclarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nMUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating\nmultimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.\nMUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions\nare uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a\ndual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with\nambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to\nyield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive\nevaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both\nopen-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to\nhuman-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more\nsophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the\nboundaries of multimodal reasoning."}

We present latent diffusion for full\nprotein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom\nprotein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from\nmolecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural\nnetwork (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein\nconformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,\nsequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent\nrepresentations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by\ndihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a\n2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor\nin a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy\nreproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT\nof approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone\nand side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of\nless than 0.03 compared to the MD data.

In this work, we\npropose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design\nlow-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed\narchitecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN\nlog N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs\nrequire only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an\nexplicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)\nestimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS\nchannels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal\ndecoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower\ncomplexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of\nthe channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to\nrealistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads\nand real-world Nanopore sequencing data.
