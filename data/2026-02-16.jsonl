However, querying NoSQL databases requires specialized technical expertise, creating a high barrier for users. While recent studies have explored text-to-NoSQL problem, they primarily focus on single-turn interactions, ignoring the conversational nature of real-world queries. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Conversational Text-to-NoSQL task, which generates NoSQL queries given a natural language question, a NoSQL database, and the dialogue history. To address this task, we propose Stage-MCTS, a framework that endows small language models (SLMs) with NoSQL-specific reasoning capabilities by formulating query generation as a search problem. The framework employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a rule-based reward to produce stepwise reasoning data, followed by progressive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and self-training strategies. We further construct CoNoSQL, a cross-domain dataset with over 2,000 dialogues and 150 databases, to support evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art large reasoning models, improving execution value match (EVM) accuracy by up to 7.93%."}

In high-performance racing shoes, these foams are critical for low weight, high cushioning, and efficient energy return; yet, their constitutive behavior remains difficult to model and poorly understood. Here we integrate mechanical testing and machine learning to discover the mechanics of two ultra-low density elastomeric polymeric foams used in elite-level racing shoes. Across uniaxial tension, confined and unconfined compression, and simple shear, both foams exhibit pronounced tension-compression asymmetry, negligible lateral strains consistent with an effective Poisson's ratio close to zero, and low hysteresis indicative of an efficient energy return. Both foams provide a similar compressive stiffness (268kPa vs. 299kPa), while one foam exhibits nearly double the shear stiffness (219kPa vs. 117kPa), implying a substantially greater lateral stability at a comparable vertical energy return (83% vs. 89%). By integrating these data into constitutive neural networks, paired with sparse regression, we discover compact, interpretable single-invariant models, supplemented by mixed-invariant or principal-stretch based terms, that capture the unique signature of the foams with R2 values close to one. From a human performance perspective, these models enable finite-element and gait-level simulations of high-performance racing shoes to quantify running economy, performance enhancements, and injury risks on an individual athlete level. More broadly, this work establishes a scalable and interpretable approach for constitutive modeling of highly compressible, ultra-light elastomeric foams with applications to wearable technologies, soft robotics, and energy-efficient mobility systems."}

Focusing on the conceptual-to-logical mapping, an Entity-Relationship (ER) model containing binary relationship types is transformed into a Relational Database Schema (RDS). The analysis is conducted under the classical transformation framework in which the logical schema is defined solely by primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK) constraints. Using generalised ER models with variable structural constraint values, the resulting RDS structures are evaluated to determine whether minimum and maximum participation constraints are represented unambiguously. The findings show that, for one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, RDSs do not unambiguously capture minimum participation constraints and do not encode exact maximum participation beyond limited cases. For many-to-many relationships, the schema indicates only that maximum cardinalities exceed one, without preserving exact values. These results clarify the representational limits of standard ER-to-relational transformations and have implications for schema design and constraint enforcement."}

When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\n  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, \"building\" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals."}

We present RADAR (Record & Artifact Detection, Alignment & Reporting), a log-adversary-aware framework that derives forensic ground truth by cross-referencing low-level storage artifacts against high-level application logs. RADAR analyzes artifacts reconstructed by the Automated NoSQL Carver (ANOC), which infers layouts and carves records directly from raw disk bytes, bypassing database APIs and the management system entirely, thereby treating physical storage as the independent evidence source. RADAR then reconciles carved artifacts with the audit log to identify delta artifacts such as unlogged insertions, silent deletions, and field-level updates that exist on disk but are absent from the logical history. We evaluate RADAR across ten NoSQL engines, including BerkeleyDB, LMDB, MDBX, etcd, ZODB, Durus, LiteDB, Realm, RavenDB, and NitriteDB, spanning key-value and document stores and multiple storage designs, e.g., copy-on-write/MVCC, B/B+ tree, and append-only. Under log-evasion scenarios, such as log suppression and post-maintenance attacks, including cases where historical bytes are pruned, RADAR consistently exposes unattributed operations while sustaining 31.7-397 MB/min processing throughput, demonstrating the feasibility of log-independent, trustworthy NoSQL forensics."}

We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss.

When time is discrete, a temporal graph can be defined as a sequence of static graphs over a discrete time span, called lifetime, or as a single graph where each edge is associated with a specific set of time instants where the edge is alive. For static graphs, Courcelle's Theorem asserts that any graph problem expressible in monadic second-order logic can be solved in linear time on graphs of bounded tree-width. We propose the first adaptation of Courcelle's Theorem for monadic second-order logic on temporal graphs that does not explicitly rely on the lifetime as a parameter. We then introduce the notion of derivative over a sliding time window of a chosen size, and define the tree-width and twin-width of the temporal graph's derivative. We exemplify its usefulness with meta theorems with respect to a temporal variant of first-order logic. The resulting logic expresses a wide range of temporal graph problems including a version of temporal cliques, an important notion when querying time series databases for community structures."}

The $1/e$ law for the classical framework has a regret of $1 - 1/e \\approx 0.632$; by contrast, we show that the class of ``pricing curves'' algorithms can guarantee a regret of at most $1/4 = 0.25$ (which is tight within the class), and the class of ``best-only pricing curves'' algorithms can guarantee a regret of at most $0.190$ (with a lower bound of $0.171$). In addition, we show that in general, no policy can give a regret guarantee better than $0.152$.

In this model, items' values are drawn from an underlying distribution and mechanisms are evaluated with respect to this draw (e.g., in expectation, or with high probability). Motivated by worst-case impossibilities which show that truthfulness severely restricts fairness and efficiency, we ask whether truthful mechanisms continue to perform poorly on random instances.\n  We first focus on dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) mechanisms. For two agents, we obtain a tight picture. Specifically, we show that there exists a distribution under which no DSIC mechanism achieves an expected welfare approximation better than $\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\approx 0.854$, and we give a DSIC mechanism that matches this bound for all distributions simultaneously. We further show that, for every distribution, there exists a DSIC mechanism that is envy-free with high probability and obtains the same welfare. A key ingredient is a new, tight connection between welfare guarantees of a family of DSIC, no-money mechanisms and i.i.d.\\ prophet inequalities. This connection allows us to generalize to $n$ agents; in particular, we obtain a DSIC mechanism that achieves a $\\approx 0.745$ approximation to welfare, and another DSIC mechanism achieving a $1/2$-approximation welfare that is envy-free with high probability.\n  We then turn to Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC). Under i.i.d.\\ valuations, we show that BIC comes at essentially no cost: we design a prior-independent BIC mechanism that achieves a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation to the optimal welfare, while being envy-free with high probability. Under independent but non-identical priors, we obtain BIC mechanisms that are $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximately Pareto efficient and envy-free with high probability."}

Despite significant advancements, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate how well agentic systems can curate products in open-web settings. Specifically, they have limited coverage of shopping scenarios, focusing only on simplified single-platform lookups rather than exploratory search. Moreover, they overlook personalization in evaluation, leaving unclear whether agents can adapt to diverse user preferences in realistic shopping contexts.

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and logical reasoning, offering new possibilities for system optimization. However, applying LLMs to real-time compaction tuning in such latency-sensitive environments is a double-edged sword. While large-scale LLMs can offer superior reasoning for strategy generation, their high inference latency and computational cost make them impractical for interactive, low-latency tuning. In contrast, small-scale LLMs achieve low latency but often at the expense of reasoning accuracy and tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we first evaluate this trade-off by analyzing the compaction-tuning performance and inference latency of LLMs at different scales in an LSM-tree-based tuning case.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach -- Bi-Level Importance Sampling with Splitting -- and characterize individual bank defaults by decoupling them from the network's complex fixed-point dynamics.

The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \\$0.20 per animation.

We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels.

Despite this long history, however, most prior works are limited to the special case where $S^\\star$ is precisely known. The more practically relevant case, where $S^\\star$ is unknown and must be learned from data, remains open: indeed, here the only available algorithms require strong assumptions on the distribution of the feature vectors (e.g., Gaussianity) and, even then, have a $d^{\\mathrm{poly} (1/\\varepsilon)}$ run time for achieving $\\varepsilon$ accuracy.\n  In this work, we give the first algorithm for truncated linear regression with unknown survival set that runs in $\\mathrm{poly} (d/\\varepsilon)$ time, by only requiring that the feature vectors are sub-Gaussian. Our algorithm relies on a novel subroutine for efficiently learning unions of a bounded number of intervals using access to positive examples (without any negative examples) under a certain smoothness condition.

Constructing flow sparsifiers with good quality and small size ($|V(G')|$) has been a central problem in graph compression. The most common approach of constructing flow sparsifiers is contraction: first compute a partition of the vertices in $V(G)$, and then contract each part into a supernode to obtain $G'$.

We model ad slots as points in a metric space, and model an advertiser's value as a function of both their bid and a discount factor determined by the configuration of other displayed ads. Within this framework, we analyze two natural models. For the Nearest-Neighbor model, where the value suppression depends only on the closest neighboring ad, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant approximation for the general case. We show that the allocation rule is monotone and can be implemented as a truthful mechanism. For a structured setting of 2D Euclidean space, we provide a PTAS. In contrast, for the Product-Distance model, where interference is aggregated multiplicatively across all neighbors, we establish a strong (and nearly-tight) hardness of approximation - no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve any polynomial-factor approximation unless P=NP, via a reduction from Max-Independent-Set.\n  Our results provide a foundation for reasoning about spatial externalities in ad allocation and for designing efficient, truthful mechanisms under such interactions."}

As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation."}

At the same time, generative artificial intelligence is reshaping development practice, offering powerful forms of assistance while introducing new challenges for accountability, reflection, and methodological rigour. Although Action Design Research (ADR) provides a well-established foundation for studying and constructing socio-technical artefacts, it offers limited guidance on how its principles can be operationalised in the day-to-day practice of solo, AI-assisted research software development. This paper proposes the SHAPR framework (Solo, Human-centred, AI-assisted PRactice) as a practice-level operational framework that complements ADR by translating its high-level principles into actionable guidance for contemporary research contexts. SHAPR supports the enactment of ADR Building-Intervention-Evaluation cycles by making explicit the roles, artefacts, reflective practices, and lightweight governance mechanisms required to sustain human accountability and learning in AI-assisted development. The contribution of the paper is conceptual: SHAPR itself is treated as the primary design artefact and unit of analysis and is evaluated formatively through reflective analysis of its internal coherence, alignment with ADR principles, and applicability to solo research practice. By explicitly linking research software development, Human-AI collaboration, and reflective learning, this study contributes to broader discussions on how SHAPR can support both knowledge production and HDR researcher training."}

While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. \"The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles,\" that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons.

In particular, minimum-norm interpolating estimators can perform well, suggesting the need for new tradeoff in these settings. Accordingly, we propose a regularization-sharpness tradeoff for overparameterized linear regression with an $\\ell^p$ penalty. Inspired by the interpolating information criterion, our framework decomposes the selection penalty into a regularization term (quantifying the alignment of the regularizer and the interpolator) and a geometric sharpness term on the interpolating manifold (quantifying the effect of local perturbations), yielding a tradeoff analogous to bias-variance. Building on prior analyses that established this information criterion for ridge regularizers, this work first provides a general expression of the interpolating information criterion for $\\ell^p$ regularizers where $p \\ge 2$. Subsequently, we extend this to the LASSO interpolator with $\\ell^1$ regularizer, which induces stronger sparsity.

This problem considers the decision task of whether two point sets are congruent under translation and rotation. A related and more general problem, geometric hashing, considers the task of compactly encoding multiple point sets for efficient congruence queries. Despite its wide applications, both problems have received little prior attention in space-aware settings.\n  In this work, we study the two-dimensional congruence testing and geometric hashing problem in the streaming model, where data arrive as a stream and the primary goal is to minimize the space usage. To meaningfully analyze space complexity, we address the underaddressed issue of input precision by working in the finite-precision rational setting: the input point coordinates are rational numbers of the form $p/q$ with $|p|, |q| \\le U$.\n  Our result considers a stronger variant of congruence testing called congruence identification, for which we obtain a 3-pass randomized streaming algorithm using $O(\\log n(\\log U+\\log n))$ space. Using the congruence identification algorithm as a building block, we give a 6-pass $O(m\\log n (\\log n + \\log U + \\log m))$-space randomized streaming algorithm that outputs a hash function of length $O(\\log n+\\log U+\\log m)$.\n  Our key technical tool for achieving space efficiency is the use of complex moments. While complex moment methods are widely employed as heuristics in object recognition, their effectiveness is often limited by vanishing moment issues (Flusser and Suk [IEEE Trans.

We show that, in the rational setting, it suffices to track only $O(\\log n)$ complex moments to ensure a non-vanishing moment, thus providing a sound theoretical guarantee for recovering a valid rotation in positive instances."}

These systems rely heavily on distributed architectures, requiring robust mechanisms to manage data and interactions among participants securely. One critical aspect of decentralized systems is key management, which is essential for encrypting files, securing database segments, and enabling private transactions. However, securely managing cryptographic keys in a distributed environment poses significant risks, especially when nodes in the network can be compromised [9]. This research proposes a decentralized database scheme specifically designed for secure and private key management. Our approach ensures that cryptographic keys are not stored explicitly at any location, preventing their discovery even if an attacker gains control of multiple nodes. Instead of traditional storage, keys are encoded and distributed using the BFLUT (Bloom Filter for Private Look-Up Tables) algorithm [7], which enables secure retrieval without direct exposure. The system leverages OrbitDB [4], IPFS [1], and IPNS [10] for decentralized data management, providing robust support for consistency, scalability, and simultaneous updates. By combining these technologies, our scheme enhances both security and privacy while maintaining high performance and reliability. Our findings demonstrate the system's capability to securely manage keys, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure privacy, making it a foundational solution for Web3 applications requiring decentralized security."}

However, most existing methods are stateless: they recompute entity representations at each timestamp from a limited query window, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone. Subsequently, a dual-track evolution mechanism writes the updated context back to the global entity state memory, balancing plasticity against stability. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting.

We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states.

Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores."}

We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online."}

Formally, for a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ and $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$, a $k$-node strong connectivity certificate is a subgraph $H=(V,A')\\subseteq G$ such that for every pair of distinct nodes $s,t\\in V$, the number of pairwise internally node-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $H$ is at least $k$ or the corresponding number in $G$. In light of the inherent hardness of directed connectivity problems, several prior work focused on restricted graph classes, showing that several problems that are hard in general become efficiently solvable when the input graph is a tournament (i.e., a directed complete graph) (Chakrabarti et al. [SODA 2020]; Baweja, Jia, and Woddruff [ITCS 2022]), or close to a tournament in edit distance (Ghosh and Kuchlous [ESA 2024]). Extending this line of work, our main result shows, at a qualitative level, that the streaming complexity of strong connectivity certificates and related problems is parameterized by independence number, demonstrating a continuum of hardness for directed graph connectivity problems. Quantitatively, for an $n$-node graph with independence number $α$, we give $p$-pass randomized algorithms that compute a $k$-node strong connectivity certificate of size $O(αn)$ using $\\tilde{O}(k^{1-1/p}αn^{1+1/p})$ space in the insertion-only model. For the lower bound, we show that even when $k=1$, any $p$-pass streaming algorithm for a 1-node strong connectivity certificate in the insertion-only model requires $Ω(αn/p)$ space. To derive these lower bounds, we introduce the gadget-embedding tournament framework to construct direct-sum-type hard instances with a prescribed independence number, which is applicable to lower-bounding a wide range of directed graph problems."}

Although it is hard for a student to obtain an exact preference, she can usually compare specific features of colleges, such as reputation, location, and campus facilities. Motivated by this, we propose a feature-based uncertainty model for school choice where a student's preference is based on a linear combination of her utilities over different features, and the coefficients of the combination are treated as random variables. Our main goal is to achieve a higher probability of stability (ProS) and incentive compatibility (IC) for students. Unfortunately, these two goals are incompatible in general. We show that a student-proposing deferred acceptance (DA) that prioritizes colleges with higher expected ranking can achieve a worst-case approximation ratio of $(1/n)^n$ on ProS, while a DA with a carefully defined iterated comparison vector can guarantee the strongest achievable form of IC.

Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence."}

We present Visual RAG Toolkit, a practical system for scaling visual multi-vector retrieval with training-free, model-aware pooling and multi-stage retrieval. Motivated by Matryoshka Embeddings, our method performs static spatial pooling - including a lightweight sliding-window averaging variant - over patch embeddings to produce compact tile-level and global representations for fast candidate generation, followed by exact MaxSim reranking using full multi-vector embeddings.\n  Our design yields a quadratic reduction in vector-to-vector comparisons by reducing stored vectors per page from thousands to dozens, notably without requiring post-training, adapters, or distillation. Across experiments with interaction-style models such as ColPali and ColSmol-500M, we observe that over the limited ViDoRe v2 benchmark corpus 2-stage retrieval typically preserves NDCG and Recall @ 5/10 with minimal degradation, while substantially improving throughput (approximately 4x QPS); with sensitivity mainly at very large k. The toolkit additionally provides robust preprocessing - high resolution PDF to image conversion, optional margin/empty-region cropping and token hygiene (indexing only visual tokens) - and a reproducible evaluation pipeline, enabling rapid exploration of two-, three-, and cascaded retrieval variants. By emphasizing efficiency at common cutoffs (e.g., k <= 10), the toolkit lowers hardware barriers and makes state-of-the-art visual retrieval more accessible in practice."}

The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings."}

Although the BMC is widely adopted by both practitioners and scholars, significant challenges remain in formally modelling business models, particularly with regard to explicit specification of inter-component relationships, while preserving the simplicity that characterises the BMC. Addressing this tension between modelling rigour and practical relevance, this research adopts a Design Science Research approach to formally specify relationships among BMC components and to strengthen their theoretical grounding through an adaptation of the V 4 framework. The proposed metamodel consolidates BMC relationships into three core types: supports, determines, and affects, providing explicit semantics while remaining accessible to end users through graphical tooling. The findings highlight that formally specifying relationships significantly improves the interpretability and consistency of BMC representations. The proposed metamodel and tool offer a rigorous yet usable foundation for developing DSML-based BMC tools and for enabling systematic integration of the BMC into widely used software and enterprise modelling environments, thereby bridging business modelling and enterprise architecture practices for both academics and practitioners."}

To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming.

In clairvoyant scheduling, where job processing times are revealed upon arrival, the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm is optimal. In practice, however, exact processing times are often unknown. At the opposite extreme, non-clairvoyant scheduling, in which processing times are revealed only upon completion, suffers from strong lower bounds on the competitive ratio. This motivates the study of intermediate information models. We introduce a new model in which processing times are revealed gradually during execution. Each job consists of a sequence of operations, and the processing time of an operation becomes known only after the preceding one completes. This models many scheduling scenarios that arise in computing systems.\n  Our main result is a deterministic $O(m^2)$-competitive algorithm, where $m$ is the maximum number of operations per job. More specifically, we prove a refined competitive ratio in $O(m_1 \\cdot m_2)$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are instance-dependent parameters describing the operation size structure. Our algorithm and analysis build on recent advancements in robust flow time minimization (SODA '26), where jobs arrive with estimated sizes. However, in our setting we have no bounded estimate on a job's processing time. Thus, we design a highly adaptive algorithm that gradually explores a job's operations while working on them, and groups them into virtual chunks whose size can be well-estimated. This is a crucial ingredient of our result and requires a much more careful analysis compared to the robust setting. We also provide lower bounds showing that our bounds are essentially best possible. For the special case of scheduling with uniform obligatory tests, we show that SRPT at the operation level is $2$-competitive, which is best possible."}

While this paradigm better exploits the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, most existing LLM-based rerankers rely on autoregressive generation, which limits their efficiency and flexibility. In particular, token-by-token decoding incurs high latency, while the fixed left-to-right generation order causes early prediction errors to propagate and is difficult to revise. To address these limitations, we explore the use of diffusion language models (dLLMs) for document reranking and propose DiffuRank, a reranking framework built upon dLLMs. Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs support more flexible decoding and generation processes that are not constrained to a left-to-right order, and enable parallel decoding, which may lead to improved efficiency and controllability. Specifically, we investigate three reranking strategies based on dLLMs: (1) a pointwise approach that uses dLLMs to estimate the relevance of each query-document pair; (2) a logit-based listwise approach that prompts dLLMs to jointly assess the relevance of multiple documents and derives ranking lists directly from model logits; and (3) a permutation-based listwise approach that adapts the canonical decoding process of dLLMs to the reranking tasks. For each approach, we design corresponding training methods to fully exploit the advantages of dLLMs. We evaluate both zero-shot and fine-tuned reranking performance on multiple benchmarks. Experimental results show that dLLMs achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of autoregressive LLMs with similar model sizes. These findings demonstrate the promise of diffusion-based language models as a compelling alternative to autoregressive architectures for document reranking."}

Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization."}

While functionality-oriented GUI testing has attracted growing research attention, existing approaches largely overlook interactions across functionalities, making them ineffective at uncovering deep bugs hidden in inter-functional behaviors. To fill this gap, we first design a Functional Flow Graph (FFG), a behavioral model that explicitly captures an app's functional units and their inter-functional interactions. Based on the FFG, we further introduce an inter-functional-flow-oriented GUI testing approach with the dual goals of precise model construction and deep bug detection. This approach is realized through a long-short-term-view-guided testing process. By combining two complementary test-generation views, it can adaptively refine functional boundaries and systematically explore inter-functional flows under diverse triggering conditions. We implement our approach in a tool called FuncDroid, and evaluate it on two benchmarks: (1) a widely-used open-source benchmark with 50 reproducible crash bugs and (2) a diverse set of 52 popular commercial apps. Experimental results demonstrate that FuncDroid significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both coverage (+28%) and bug detection number (+107%). Moreover, FuncDroid successfully uncovers 18 previously unknown non-crash functional bugs in commercial apps, confirming its practical effectiveness."}

Sellers repeatedly set prices using simple learning rules and observe only their own prices and realized demand, even though demand depends on all sellers' prices and is subject to random shocks. Each seller runs two-point A/B price experiments, in the spirit of switchback-style designs, and updates a baseline price using a linear demand estimate fitted to its own data. Under certain conditions on demand, the resulting dynamics converge to a Conjectural Variations (CV) equilibrium, a classic static equilibrium notion in which each seller best responds under a conjecture that rivals' prices respond systematically to changes in its own price. Unlike standard CV models that treat conjectures as behavioral primitives, we show that these conjectures arise endogenously from the bias in demand learning induced by correlated experimentation (e.g., due to synchronized repricing schedules). This learning bias selects the long-run equilibrium, often leading to supra-competitive prices. Notably, we show that under independent experimentation, this bias vanishes and the learning dynamics converge to the standard Nash equilibrium. We provide simple sufficient conditions on demand for convergence in standard models and establish a finite-sample guarantee: up to logarithmic factors, the squared price error decays on the order of $T^{-1/2}$. Our results imply that in competitive markets, experimentation design can serve as a market design lever, selecting the equilibrium reached by practical learning algorithms."}

The current state-of-the-art models mainly employ two different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR: mixed multi-task RLVR and separate RLVR followed by model merging.

In this work, we propose Reasoning to Rank, an end-to-end training framework that internalizes recommendation utility optimization into the learning of step-by-step reasoning in LLMs. To avoid position bias in LLM reasoning and enable direct optimization of the reasoning process, our framework performs reasoning at the user-item level and employs reinforcement learning for end-to-end training of the LLM.

Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.\n  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones.

We develop a finite-sample, design-based formulation of random forests in which each tree is an explicit randomized conditional regression function. This perspective yields an exact variance identity for the forest predictor that separates finite-aggregation variability from a structural dependence term that persists even under infinite aggregation. We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone. The resulting framework clarifies how resampling, feature-level randomization, and split selection govern resolution, tree variability, and dependence, and establishes random forests as explicit finite-sample statistical designs whose behavior is determined by their underlying randomized construction."}

McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders.

In U2I2I, the system selects a small set of historical interactions as triggers to seed downstream item-to-item (I2I) retrieval across multiple channels. In production, triggers are often selected using rule-based policies or learned scorers and tuned in a channel-by-channel manner. However, these practices face two persistent challenges: biased value attribution that values triggers by on-trigger feedback rather than their downstream utility as retrieval seeds, and uncoordinated multi-channel routing where channels select triggers independently under a shared quota, increasing cross-channel overlap. To address these challenges, we propose Channel-Aware, Preference-Aligned Trigger Selection (CAPTS), a unified and flexible framework that treats multi-channel trigger selection as a learnable routing problem. CAPTS introduces a Value Attribution Module (VAM) that provides look-ahead supervision by crediting each trigger with the subsequent engagement generated by items retrieved from it on each I2I channel, and a Channel-Adaptive Trigger Routing (CATR) module that coordinates trigger-to-channel assignment to maximize the overall value of multi-channel retrieval.

Although code smells are widely believed to harm maintainability, most prior stability studies examine only the smells within the class being modified. In practice, however, classes can change because their efferent neighbors (i.e., the classes they depend on) are modified due to ripple effects that propagate along static dependencies, even if the class itself is clean. Such ripple effects may be more severe when the efferent neighbor exhibits code smells. In addition, code smells rarely occur alone. They often appear together within a class or across classes connected by static dependencies, a phenomenon known as code smell interrelation. Such interrelation can lead to code smell interaction, where smells are directly connected through static dependencies and may further compound maintainability issues. However, the effect of code smell interrelation and interaction on code quality remains largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates whether the presence of code smells in a class's efferent neighbors affects its stability, considering the factor of code smell interrelation and interaction. To achieve this, we mine one year of commit history from 100 top-starred GitHub projects, detect code smells and static dependencies, determine code smell interrelation and interaction, and model these factors as predictors of class stability."}

We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support."}

The key idea is that when gradients vary little across iterations, the stepsize is not unnecessarily reduced, while significant gradient fluctuations, reflecting curvature or instability, lead to automatic stepsize damping.

Before posting a price, the learner observes a $d$-dimensional context vector that influences the agent's valuations. Prior work in the contextual setting has focused on linear models. In this work, we tackle a general nonparametric setting in which the buyer's and seller's valuations behave according to arbitrary Lipschitz functions of the context.

To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training.

We propose RQ-GMM (Residual Quantized Gaussian Mixture Model), which introduces probabilistic modeling to better capture the statistical structure of multimodal embedding spaces. Through Gaussian Mixture Models combined with residual quantization, RQ-GMM achieves superior codebook utilization and reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on a large-scale short-video platform serving hundreds of millions of users demonstrate substantial improvements: RQ-GMM yields a 1.502% gain in Advertiser Value over strong baselines. The method has been fully deployed, serving daily recommendations for hundreds of millions of users."}

Currently, the focus of AAS standardization is on submodels and their security to enable interoperable data access. Their proactive behavior remains conceptual and is still a subject of scientific research. Existing studies examine proactive AAS architecture examples with a limited number of assets, raising questions about their scalability in industrial environments. To analyze proactive AAS for scaling applications, a scenario and evaluation criteria are introduced. A scalable implementation is developed using current architectures for proactive AAS, upon which experiments are conducted with a varying number of assets. The results reveal the performance limitations, communication overhead, and adaptability of the AAS-based negotiation mechanism scaling.

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari."}

On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\\ell_1$ width $γ$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(γ)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power."}

Thus, in the Optimizing PD with Dependencies ($ε$-PDD) problem, we are additionally given a food web that represents the predator-prey relationships between species. The goal is to save a set of k species of maximum phylogenetic diversity such that for every saved species, at least one of its prey is also saved. This problem is NP-hard even when the phylogenetic tree is a star. The $α$-PDD problem alters PDD by requiring that at least some fraction $α$ of the prey of every saved species are also saved.

Reachability objectives require that a given set of states is reached; safety requires that a given set is invariant. A qualitative winning condition asks that an objective is satisfied almost surely (AS) or (in negated form) with non-zero (NZ) probability.\n  We study the determinacy and complexity landscape of the problem. We show that games with conjunctions of AS and NZ reachability and safety objectives are determined, and determining the winner is PSPACE-complete. The same holds for positive boolean combinations of AS reachability and safety, as well as for negations thereof. On the other hand, games with full Boolean combinations of qualitative objectives are not determined, and are NEXPTIME-hard.

We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\n  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial."}

First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties.

We study efficient algorithms for this task when L is regular, seeking tight complexity bounds as a function of |w| for a fixed target language. Most of our results apply to an algebraically defined variant dubbed out-of-order evaluation: this problem is defined for a fixed finite monoid or semigroup S, and our goal is to compute the ordered product of the streamed elements of w.\n  We show that, for any fixed regular language or finite semigroup, both problems can be solved in constant time per streamed symbol and in linear space.

Our main contributions are therefore to show (deterministic) space complexity characterizations, which we do for out-of-order evaluation of monoids and semigroups.\n  For monoids, we establish a trichotomy: the space complexity is either Θ(1), Θ(log n), or Θ(n), where n = |w|.

Existing deep learning models often struggle with interpretability and generalization across diverse market conditions. This research presents a hybrid stacked-generalization framework, TFT-ACB-XML, for BTC closing price prediction. The framework integrates two parallel base learners: a customized Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and an Attention-Customized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (ACB), followed by an XGBoost regressor as the meta-learner. The customized TFT model handles long-range dependencies and global temporal dynamics via variable selection networks and interpretable single-head attention. The ACB module uses a new attention mechanism alongside the customized BiLSTM to capture short-term sequential dependencies. Predictions from both customized TFT and ACB are weighted through an error-reciprocal weighting strategy. These weights are derived from validation performance, where a model showing lower prediction error receives a higher weight. Finally, the framework concatenates these weighted outputs into a feature vector and feeds the vector to an XGBoost regressor, which captures non-linear residuals and produces the final BTC closing price prediction. Empirical validation using BTC data from October 1, 2014, to January 5, 2026, shows improved performance of the proposed framework compared to recent Deep Learning and Transformer baseline models. The results show a MAPE of 0.65%, an MAE of 198.15, and an RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample under a walk-forward evaluation on the test block.

From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics.

However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations.

However, existing evaluation datasets are often limited to simple queries under constrained noise conditions, making them inadequate for assessing the robustness of spoken query retrieval systems under complex acoustic perturbations. To address this limitation, we present SQuTR, a robustness benchmark for spoken query retrieval that includes a large-scale dataset and a unified evaluation protocol. SQuTR aggregates 37,317 unique queries from six commonly used English and Chinese text retrieval datasets, spanning multiple domains and diverse query types. We synthesize speech using voice profiles from 200 real speakers and mix 17 categories of real-world environmental noise under controlled SNR levels, enabling reproducible robustness evaluation from quiet to highly noisy conditions. Under the unified protocol, we conduct large-scale evaluations on representative cascaded and end-to-end retrieval systems. Experimental results show that retrieval performance decreases as noise increases, with substantially different drops across systems. Even large-scale retrieval models struggle under extreme noise, indicating that robustness remains a critical bottleneck. Overall, SQuTR provides a reproducible testbed for benchmarking and diagnostic analysis, and facilitates future research on robustness in spoken query to text retrieval."}

Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence."}

We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias."}

Its central challenge lies in the privacy-utility trade-off: calibrating noise levels to ensure robust protection without compromising statistical performance. Standard DP methods struggle with a particular class of two-stage problems prevalent in individualized treatment rules (ITRs) and causal inference. In these settings, data-dependent weights are first computed to satisfy distributional constraints, such as covariate balance, before the final parameter of interest is estimated. Current DP approaches often privatize stages independently, which either degrades weight efficacy-leading to biased and inconsistent estimates-or introduces excessive noise to account for worst-case scenarios.\n  To address these challenges, we propose the Differentially Private Two-Stage Empirical Risk Minimization (DP-2ERM), a framework that injects a carefully calibrated noise only into the second stage while maintaining privacy for the entire pipeline and preserving the integrity of the first stage weights. Our theoretical contributions include deterministic bounds on weight perturbations across various widely used weighting methods, and probabilistic bounds on sensitivity for the final estimator. Simulations and real-world applications in ITR demonstrate that DP-2ERM significantly enhances utility over existing methods while providing rigorous privacy guarantees."}

However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches.

Rich insights can be obtained by combining queries across modalities -- for example, retrieving German trains from a historical archive by applying the object query \"train\" and the metadata query \"Germany\", or searching for a face in a place. By employing vector search techniques, WISE can scale to support efficient retrieval over millions of images or thousands of hours of video. Its modular architecture facilitates the integration of new models. WISE can be deployed locally for private or sensitive collections, and has been applied to various real-world use cases.

Preprint", "summary": "The widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules for open pre-trained models has led to an interest in methods that can adaptively merge LoRAs to improve performance. These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online."}

By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint. These results indicate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning."}

While the geometries underlying OPGD and OEG, both special cases of OMD, are well understood, it remains a challenging open question on how to construct an optimal mirror map for any given constrained set and a general family of loss functions, e.g., sparse losses. Motivated by parameterizing a near-optimal set of mirror maps, we consider a simpler question: is it even possible to obtain polynomial gains in regret by using mirror maps for geometries that interpolate between $L_1$ and $L_2$, which may not be possible by restricting to only OEG ($L_1$) or OPGD ($L_2$).\n  Our main result answers this question positively. We show that mirror maps based on block norms adapt better to the sparsity of loss functions, compared to previous $L_p$ (for $p \\in [1, 2]$) interpolations. In particular, we construct a family of online convex optimization instances in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where block norm-based mirror maps achieve a provable polynomial (in $d$) improvement in regret over OEG and OPGD for sparse loss functions. We then turn to the setting in which the sparsity level of the loss functions is unknown. In this case, the choice of geometry itself becomes an online decision problem. We first show that naively switching between OEG and OPGD can incur linear regret, highlighting the intrinsic difficulty of geometry selection. To overcome this issue, we propose a meta-algorithm based on multiplicative weights that dynamically selects among a family of uniform block norms. We show that this approach effectively tunes OMD to the sparsity of the losses, yielding adaptive regret guarantees. Overall, our results demonstrate that online mirror-map selection can significantly enhance the ability of OMD to exploit sparsity in online convex optimization."}

The $1/e$ law for the classical framework has a regret of $1 - 1/e \\approx 0.632$; by contrast, we show that the class of ``pricing curves'' algorithms can guarantee a regret of at most $1/4 = 0.25$ (which is tight within the class), and the class of ``best-only pricing curves'' algorithms can guarantee a regret of at most $0.190$ (with a lower bound of $0.171$). In addition, we show that in general, no policy can give a regret guarantee better than $0.152$.

However, existing industrial systems face two fundamental challenges: (1) the semantic gap between discrete user features and the semantic intents within the chatbot's Knowledge Base, and (2) the objective misalignment between general-purpose LLM outputs and task-specific ranking utilities. To address these issues, we propose RGAlign-Rec, a closed-loop alignment framework that integrates an LLM-based semantic reasoner with a Query-Enhanced (QE) ranking model. We also introduce Ranking-Guided Alignment (RGA), a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes downstream ranking signals as feedback to refine the LLM's latent reasoning. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset from Shopee demonstrate that RGAlign-Rec achieves a 0.12% gain in GAUC, leading to a significant 3.52% relative reduction in error rate, and a 0.56% improvement in Recall@3. Online A/B testing further validates the cumulative effectiveness of our framework: the Query-Enhanced model (QE-Rec) initially yields a 0.98% improvement in CTR, while the subsequent Ranking-Guided Alignment stage contributes an additional 0.13% gain. These results indicate that ranking-aware alignment effectively synchronizes semantic reasoning with ranking objectives, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and service quality in real-world proactive recommendation systems."}

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained."}

This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task performance, personalization quality, and robustness to noisy as well as to sparse preference signals."}

Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference."}

To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries.

However, existing approaches often yield suboptimal results since they typically rely on single-step estimation of an item's intrinsic value (e.g., immediate click probability). This mechanism overlooks the instrumental effect of items, where specific interactions act as triggers to shape latent intent and drive subsequent decisions along a conversion trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose RoleGen, a novel framework that synergizes a Conversion Trajectory Reasoner with a Generative Behavioral Backbone. Specifically, the LLM-based Reasoner explicitly models the context-dependent Functional Role of items to reconstruct intent evolution. It further employs counterfactual inference to simulate diverse conversion paths, effectively mitigating interest collapse. These reasoned candidate items are integrated into the generative backbone, which is optimized via a collaborative \"Reasoning-Execution-Feedback-Reflection\" closed-loop strategy to ensure grounded execution.

We propose ProbeLLM, a benchmark-agnostic automated probing framework that elevates weakness discovery from individual failures to structured failure modes. ProbeLLM formulates probing as a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search, explicitly allocating limited probing budgets between global exploration of new failure regions and local refinement of recurring error patterns. By restricting probing to verifiable test cases and leveraging tool-augmented generation and verification, ProbeLLM grounds failure discovery in reliable evidence. Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction. Across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, ProbeLLM reveals substantially broader, cleaner, and more fine-grained failure landscapes than static benchmarks and prior automated methods, supporting a shift from case-centric evaluation toward principled weakness discovery."}

However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation. Experimental results for three realistic design tasks illustrate substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality."}

In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. These results establish Diverging Flows as a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science."}

We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \\log m$ bits of information about the environment.

Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \\textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency."}

We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora."}

In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations.

We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor.

Additionally, current machine learning-based inference methods are typically limited to estimating scalar parameters in a multidimensional space rather than full differential distributions. We propose a general framework for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate Distributions of Interest (DoI), defined as learnable invertible transformations of the feature space. We introduce Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, preserving tractability without combinatorial explosion. Crucially, we develop an amortized training strategy that learns the conditional dependence of the DoI on nuisance parameters in a single optimization process, bypassing the need for repetitive training during the likelihood scan. This allows for the simultaneous extraction of the underlying distribution and the robust profiling of nuisances. The method is validated on a synthetic dataset emulating a high-energy physics measurement with multiple systematic sources, demonstrating its potential for unbinned, functional measurements in complex analyses."}

Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments."}

Recent smartphone-based mobility data offer unprecedented spatiotemporal coverage, yet translating these opportunistic observations into accurate population estimates remains challenging due to incomplete sensing, spatially heterogeneous device penetration, and unstable observation processes. We propose a Stable-Attendance Anchor Calibration (SAAC) framework to reconstruct hourly population presence at the Census block group level across the United States. SAAC formulates population estimation as a balance-based population accounting problem, combining residential population with time-varying inbound and outbound mobility inferred from device-event observations. To address observation bias and identifiability limitations, the framework leverages locations with highly regular attendance as calibration anchors, using high schools in this study. These anchors enable estimation of observation scaling factors that correct for under-recorded mobility events. By integrating anchor-based calibration with an explicit sampling model, SAAC enables consistent conversion from observed device events to population presence at fine temporal resolution. The inferred population patterns are consistent with established empirical findings in prior mobility and urban population studies. SAAC provides a generalizable framework for transforming large-scale, biased digital trace data into interpretable dynamic population products, with implications for urban science, public health, and human mobility research.

For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\\ell_1$ width $γ$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(γ)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power."}

Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($τ_{\\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity.

However, existing robotic approaches either focus primarily on grasping or target object-specific articulated manipulation, and they rarely incorporate explicit actuation energy into multi-objective optimisation, which limits their scalability and suitability for long-term deployment in real O&M settings. Therefore, this paper proposes an articulation-agnostic and energy-aware reinforcement learning framework for robotic manipulation in intelligent infrastructure O&M. The method combines part-guided 3D perception, weighted point sampling, and PointNet-based encoding to obtain a compact geometric representation that generalises across heterogeneous articulated objects. Manipulation is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), in which actuation energy is explicitly modelled and regulated via a Lagrangian-based constrained Soft Actor-Critic scheme. The policy is trained end-to-end under this CMDP formulation, enabling effective articulated-object operation while satisfying a long-horizon energy budget.

Our study adopts a structured data model with tokens that include both class-relevant and class-irrelevant patterns under token-level noise and examines two canonical regimes: majority-voting and locality-structured data sequences.

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning."}

Benefiting from the rapid advancement of joint audio-video generation, this paper proposes a more compelling new task: sync audio-video customization, which aims to synchronously customize both video identity and audio timbre. Specifically, given a reference image $I^{r}$ and a reference audio $A^{r}$, this novel task requires generating videos that maintain the identity of the reference image while imitating the timbre of the reference audio, with spoken content freely specifiable through user-provided textual prompts. To this end, we propose OmniCustom, a powerful DiT-based audio-video customization framework that can synthesize a video following reference image identity, audio timbre, and text prompts all at once in a zero-shot manner. Our framework is built on three key contributions. First, identity and audio timbre control are achieved through separate reference identity and audio LoRA modules that operate through self-attention layers within the base audio-video generation model. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective alongside the standard flow matching objective. It uses predicted flows conditioned on reference inputs as positive examples and those without reference conditions as negative examples, thereby enhancing the model ability to preserve identity and timbre. Third, we train OmniCustom on our constructed large-scale, high-quality audio-visual human dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniCustom outperforms existing methods in generating audio-video content with consistent identity and timbre fidelity."}

Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence."}

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm."}

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining."}

Includes qualitative evaluation across multiple physics domains", "summary": "We present a multi-agent framework for generating physics simulation code from natural language descriptions, featuring a novel perceptual self-reflection mechanism for validation. The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \\$0.20 per animation. These results validate our hypothesis that feeding visual simulation outputs back to a vision-language model for iterative refinement significantly outperforms single-shot code generation for physics simulation tasks and highlights the potential of agentic AI to support engineering workflows and physics data generation pipelines."}

In particular, exponential family distributions offer a unified and analytically tractable modeling paradigm that encompasses many commonly used distributions. In this paper, we investigate analytic results for two important members of the exponential family within the HDP framework: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the corresponding Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under the hierarchical Dirichlet process construction. Detailed derivations and proofs are provided to clarify the underlying mathematical structure and to demonstrate how conjugacy can be systematically exploited in hierarchical nonparametric models. Our work extends the applicability of the HDP beyond the Dirichlet-multinomial setting and furnishes practical analytic results for researchers employing hierarchical Bayesian nonparametrics."}

In this study, we investigated the potential of visible and hyperspectral imaging as cost-effective and quick-response alternatives to conventional chemical analyses for characterizing key properties of cowś milk. A total of 52 milk samples were analysed to determine their biochemical composition (polyphenols, antioxidant capacity, and fatty acids) using spectrophotometer methods and standard gas-liquid and high-performance liquid chromatography (GLC/HPLC). Concurrently, visible (RGB) images were captured using a standard smartphone, and hyperspectral data were acquired in the near-infrared range. A comprehensive analytical framework, including eleven different machine learning algorithms, was employed to correlate imaging features with biochemical measurements. Analysis of visible images accurately distinguished between fresh samples and those stored for 12 days (100 percent accuracy) and achieved perfect discrimination between antibiotic-treated and untreated groups (100 percent accuracy). Moreover, image-derived features enabled perfect prediction of the polyphenols content and the antioxidant capacity using an XGBoost model. Hyperspectral imaging further achieved classification accuracies exceeding 95 percent for several individual fatty acids and 94.8 percent for treatment groups using a Random Forest model. These findings demonstrate that both visible and hyperspectral imaging, when coupled with machine learning, are powerful, non-invasive tools for the rapid assessment of milkś chemical and nutritional profiles, highlighting the strong potential of imaging-based approaches for milk quality assessment."}

Yet this rapid expansion has led to a noisy and fragmented information environment, increasing cognitive burden as shoppers explore and purchase products online. With promising potential to alleviate this challenge, agentic systems have garnered growing attention for automating user-side tasks in web shopping. Despite significant advancements, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate how well agentic systems can curate products in open-web settings. Specifically, they have limited coverage of shopping scenarios, focusing only on simplified single-platform lookups rather than exploratory search. Moreover, they overlook personalization in evaluation, leaving unclear whether agents can adapt to diverse user preferences in realistic shopping contexts. To address this gap, we present AgenticShop, the first benchmark for evaluating agentic systems on personalized product curation in open-web environment. Crucially, our approach features realistic shopping scenarios, diverse user profiles, and a verifiable, checklist-driven personalization evaluation framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that current agentic systems remain largely insufficient, emphasizing the need for user-side systems that effectively curate tailored products across the modern web."}

Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low."}

We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support."}

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari."}

We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions.

This research presents a hybrid stacked-generalization framework, TFT-ACB-XML, for BTC closing price prediction. The framework integrates two parallel base learners: a customized Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and an Attention-Customized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (ACB), followed by an XGBoost regressor as the meta-learner. The customized TFT model handles long-range dependencies and global temporal dynamics via variable selection networks and interpretable single-head attention. The ACB module uses a new attention mechanism alongside the customized BiLSTM to capture short-term sequential dependencies. Predictions from both customized TFT and ACB are weighted through an error-reciprocal weighting strategy. These weights are derived from validation performance, where a model showing lower prediction error receives a higher weight. Finally, the framework concatenates these weighted outputs into a feature vector and feeds the vector to an XGBoost regressor, which captures non-linear residuals and produces the final BTC closing price prediction. Empirical validation using BTC data from October 1, 2014, to January 5, 2026, shows improved performance of the proposed framework compared to recent Deep Learning and Transformer baseline models. The results show a MAPE of 0.65%, an MAE of 198.15, and an RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample under a walk-forward evaluation on the test block. The evaluation period spans the 2024 BTC halving and the spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) period, which coincide with major liquidity and volatility shifts."}

However, detecting single-lane abnormalities, that lead to congestions, is still a challenge. These single-lane abnormalities can be detected by monitoring lane change behaviour of vehicles, performed to avoid congestion along the monitoring section of a road. This paper presents a method to detect single-lane abnormalities by tracking individual vehicle paths and detecting vehicle lane changes along a section of a road. We propose a method to estimate the vehicle position at all time instances and fit a path using clustering techniques. We detect vehicle lane change by monitoring any change in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations by tracking a reference vehicle along a highway. The evaluation of our proposed method with real traffic data showed 80% accuracy for lane change detection events that represent presence of abnormalities."}

We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias."}

To address this challenge, we propose Power Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (PICODE) Networks, a unified, causality-informed architecture that jointly performs anomaly detection along with the explanation why it is detected as an anomaly, including root cause localization, anomaly type classification, and anomaly shape characterization. Experimental results in power systems demonstrate that PICODE achieves competitive detection performance while offering improved interpretability and reduced reliance on labeled data or external causal graphs. We provide theoretical results demonstrating the alignment between the shape of anomaly functions and the changes in the weights of the extracted causal graphs."}

Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets."}

The method claims that accurate spatial control can be achieved by optimizing a single diffusion latent at an intermediate timestep, together with identity-preserving fine-tuning and spatial regularization. This work presents a reproducibility study of DragDiffusion using the authors' released implementation and the DragBench benchmark. We reproduce the main ablation studies on diffusion timestep selection, LoRA-based fine-tuning, mask regularization strength, and UNet feature supervision, and observe close agreement with the qualitative and quantitative trends reported in the original work. At the same time, our experiments show that performance is sensitive to a small number of hyperparameter assumptions, particularly the optimized timestep and the feature level used for motion supervision, while other components admit broader operating ranges. We further evaluate a multi-timestep latent optimization variant and find that it does not improve spatial accuracy while substantially increasing computational cost.

While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \\emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability."}

To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements."}

RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage.

However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation. Experimental results for three realistic design tasks illustrate substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality."}

We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora."}

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency.

To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently."}

We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality.

In this paper, we introduce a novel recovery-based shielding framework that enables safe RL with a provable safety lower bound for unknown and non-linear continuous dynamical systems. The proposed approach integrates a backup policy (shield) with the RL agent, leveraging Gaussian process (GP) based uncertainty quantification to predict potential violations of safety constraints, dynamically recovering to safe trajectories only when necessary. Experience gathered by the 'shielded' agent is used to construct the GP models, with policy optimization via internal model-based sampling - enabling unrestricted exploration and sample efficient learning, without compromising safety. Empirically our approach demonstrates strong performance and strict safety-compliance on a suite of continuous control environments."}

Because intimacy is a primary coping mechanism for loneliness that varies by attachment style and age, we examine how different types of users form intimate relationships with AI companions in response to loneliness. Drawing on a hermeneutic literature review and a survey of 277 active AI companion users, we develop and test a model in which loneliness predicts intimacy, moderated by attachment insecurity and conditioned by age. Although the cross-sectional data limits causal inference, the results reveal a differentiated pattern. Loneliness is paradoxically associated with reduced intimacy for securely attached users but with increased intimacy for avoidant and ambivalent users, while anxious users show mixed effects. Older adults report higher intimacy even at lower loneliness levels. These findings challenge portrayals of AI companions as universal remedies for loneliness.

While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones. Across diverse benchmarks, CUD yields students that are not only more accurate, but also more calibrated under shift and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs."}

The production and quality of grapes are significantly impacted by grape diseases such as Bacterial Rot, Downy Mildew, and Powdery Mildew. Consequently, the sustainable management of a vineyard necessitates the early and precise identification of these diseases. Current automated methods, particularly those that are based on the YOLO framework, are often computationally costly and lack interpretability that makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios. This study proposes grape leaf disease classification using Optimized DenseNet 121. Domain-specific preprocessing and extensive connectivity reveal disease-relevant characteristics, including veins, edges, and lesions. An extensive comparison with baseline CNN models, including ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance. It achieves an accuracy of 99.27%, an F1 score of 99.28%, a specificity of 99.71%, and a Kappa of 98.86%, with an inference time of 9 seconds. The cross-validation findings show a mean accuracy of 99.12%, indicating strength and generalizability across all classes. We also employ Grad-CAM to highlight disease-related regions to guarantee the model is highlighting physiologically relevant aspects and increase transparency and confidence. Model optimization reduces processing requirements for real-time deployment, while transfer learning ensures consistency on smaller and unbalanced samples. An effective architecture, domain-specific preprocessing, and interpretable outputs make the proposed framework scalable, precise, and computationally inexpensive for detecting grape leaf diseases."}

We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates. The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP. Experiments on synthetic and real data confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity across settings."}

Using a time-to-collision (TTC) behavioral paradigm, we introduce a comparison pipeline and alignment metric, then vary model training time, size, and effective capacity via pruning. Across all manipulations, alignment with human behavior follows an inverse U-shaped curve: small/briefly trained/pruned models under-segment into blobs; large/fully trained models over-segment with boundary wiggles; and an intermediate ideal body granularity'' best matches humans. This suggests human-like coarse bodies emerge from resource constraints rather than bespoke biases, and points to simple knobs - early checkpoints, modest architectures, light pruning - for eliciting physics-efficient representations. We situate these results within resource-rational accounts balancing recognition detail against physical affordances."}

Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores."}

Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness."}

ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning.

In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime. Our approach achieves an average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime architectures while maintaining classification accuracy. Redundancy analyses confirm that DSP produces compact and informative representations, offering a practical path for scalable and efficient deep TSC deployment."}

This unique combination of characteristics seems to challenge the understanding that early loss of episodic memory may impede cognitive development and result in severe mental retardation. Although a few underlying mechanisms have been suggested, no computational model has been reported that is able to mimic the unique combination of characteristics. In this study, a cognitive system is presented, and developmental amnesia is demonstrated computationally in terms of impaired episodic recall, spared recognition and spared semantic learning. Impaired sequential/spatial learning ability of the hippocampus is suggested to be the cause of such amnesia. Simulation shows that impaired sequential leaning may only result in severe impairment of episodic recall, but affect neither recognition ability nor semantic learning. The spared semantic learning is inline with the view that semantic learning is largely associated with the consolidation of episodic memory, a process in which episodic memory may be mostly activated randomly, instead of sequentially. Furthermore, retrograded amnesia is also simulated, and the result and its mechanism are in agreement with most computational models of amnesia reported previously."}

However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments."}

In this work, we analysis from a spectral perspective on parameter and gradient spaces, uncover that (1) experts share highly overlapping dominant spectral components in their parameters, (2) dominant gradient subspaces are strongly aligned across experts, driven by ubiquitous low-rank structure in human corpus, and (3) gating mechanisms preferentially route inputs along these dominant directions, further limiting specialization. To address this, we propose Spectral-Decoupled MoE (SD-MoE), which decomposes both parameter and gradient in the spectral space. SD-MoE improves performance across downstream tasks, enables effective expert specialization, incurring minimal additional computation, and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing MoE architectures, including Qwen and DeepSeek."}

However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \\textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Conversational Text-to-NoSQL task, which generates NoSQL queries given a natural language question, a NoSQL database, and the dialogue history. To address this task, we propose Stage-MCTS, a framework that endows small language models (SLMs) with NoSQL-specific reasoning capabilities by formulating query generation as a search problem. The framework employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a rule-based reward to produce stepwise reasoning data, followed by progressive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and self-training strategies. We further construct CoNoSQL, a cross-domain dataset with over 2,000 dialogues and 150 databases, to support evaluation.

However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance.

We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker.

To address this challenge, we propose Power Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (PICODE) Networks, a unified, causality-informed architecture that jointly performs anomaly detection along with the explanation why it is detected as an anomaly, including root cause localization, anomaly type classification, and anomaly shape characterization. Experimental results in power systems demonstrate that PICODE achieves competitive detection performance while offering improved interpretability and reduced reliance on labeled data or external causal graphs.

To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation."}

We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces."}

Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets."}

While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a \"Normalization Squeeze,\" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks."}

Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans.

We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature."}

However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods."}

Bias correction and spatial downscaling are fundamental components to develop operational weather forecast systems, as they seek to improve the consistency between coarse-resolution climate model simulations or satellite-based estimates and ground-based observations. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been increasingly replaced traditional statistical methods to generate high-resolution, bias free projections of climate variables. For example, Max-Average U-Net (MAUNet) architecture has been demonstrated for its ability to downscale precipitation estimates. The versatility and adaptability of these neural models make them highly effective across a range of applications, though this often come at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. The aim of this research is to develop light-weight neural network architectures for both bias correction and downscaling of precipitation, for which the teacher-student based learning paradigm is explored. This research demonstrates the adaptability of MAUNet to the task of bias correction, and further introduces a compact, lightweight neural network architecture termed MAUNet-Light.The proposed MAUNet-Light model is developed by transferring knowledge from the trained MAUNet, and it is designed to perform both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational requirements without any significant loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art."}

Specifically, we first establish a theoretical relationship between the partition function and per-prompt accuracy estimates. Building on this key insight, we propose Partition Function-Guided RL (PACED-RL), a post-training framework that leverages accuracy estimates to prioritize informative question prompts during training, and further improves sample efficiency through an accuracy estimate error-prioritized replay. Crucially, both components reuse information already produced during GFlowNet training, effectively amortizing the compute overhead into the existing optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate strong performance improvements over GRPO and prior GFlowNet approaches, highlighting PACED-RL as a promising direction for a more sample efficient distribution-matching training for LLMs."}

To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra. These dimensionality-reduction techniques serve as the computational acceleration core of our proposed algorithm framework. Theoretical results on approximation error upper bounds and convergence analysis for the proposed method are derived.

By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint.

Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference."}

This structural regularization induces controlled encoder-decoder information flow and stabilizes joint optimization. Across single-task denoising and joint denoising-classification settings, AddUNet achieves competitive reconstruction performance with improved training stability. In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination. Notably, reconstruction remains robust even under limited classification capacity, indicating implicit task decoupling through additive fusion. These findings show that simple constraints on skip connections act as an effective architectural regularizer for stable and scalable multi-task learning without increasing model complexity."}

We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation."}

To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with High-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer. Together, these results establish a practical, experimentally validated pathway toward natural and deployable humanoid control."}

The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation.

While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones. Across diverse benchmarks, CUD yields students that are not only more accurate, but also more calibrated under shift and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs."}

We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation.

Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception.

To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks."}

Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines."}

SQuTR aggregates 37,317 unique queries from six commonly used English and Chinese text retrieval datasets, spanning multiple domains and diverse query types. We synthesize speech using voice profiles from 200 real speakers and mix 17 categories of real-world environmental noise under controlled SNR levels, enabling reproducible robustness evaluation from quiet to highly noisy conditions.

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured."}

We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification. Overall we find LLM-based anonymizers, including new iterative anonymizers, to provide a better privacy-utility trade-off albeit at a higher computational cost. Importantly, we also find them to work well across languages. We conclude with recommendations for future anonymization tools and will release the benchmark and encourage community efforts to expand it, in particular to other geographies."}

We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \\ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients.

Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns)."}

In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories."}

We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker.

Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation."}

Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths.

We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions.

Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks."}

We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions.

The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings."}

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting."}

In this work, we introduce a Petri net (PN)-based framework that captures the BNN's internal operations as event-driven processes. By \"eventizing\" their operations, we expose their causal relationships and dependencies for a fine-grained analysis of concurrency, ordering, and state evolution. Here, we construct modular PN blueprints for core BNN components including activation, gradient computation and weight updates, and compose them into a complete system-level model. We then validate the composed PN against a reference software-based BNN, verify it against reachability and structural checks to establish 1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion and correct-by-construction causal sequencing, before we assess its scalability and complexity at segment, component, and system levels using the automated measurement tools in Workcraft. Overall, this framework enables causal introspection of transparent and event-driven BNNs that are amenable to formal reasoning and verification."}

To address this gap, we adopt a knowledge-based design perspective and investigate what information tutor-ing-oriented GSRs require to function responsibly and effectively in higher education. Based on twelve semi-structured interviews with university stu-dents and lecturers, we identify twelve design requirements across three knowledge types: self-knowledge (assertive, conscientious and friendly per-sonality with customizable role), user-knowledge (personalized information about student learning goals, learning progress, motivation type, emotional state and background), and context-knowledge (learning materials, educa-tional strategies, course-related information, and physical learning environ-ment).

By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data.

Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy.

However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment."}

It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%.

In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design.

In clinical practice, the gold standard for diagnosis is dynamic X-ray imaging. However, X-ray provides only 2D motion information, while 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) cannot efficiently capture motion. Therefore, there is a need for a system capable of visualizing real-time 3D spinal motion while minimizing radiation exposure.\n  Methods: We propose ultrasound as an auxiliary modality for 3D spine visualization. Due to acoustic limitations, ultrasound captures only the superficial spinal surface. Therefore, the partially compounded ultrasound volume is registered to preoperative 3D imaging. In this study, CBCT provides the neutral spine configuration, while robotic ultrasound acquisition is performed at maximal spinal bending. A kinematic model is applied to the CBCT-derived spine model for coarse registration, followed by ICP for fine registration, with kinematic parameters optimized based on the registration results. Real-time ultrasound motion tracking is then used to estimate continuous 3D spinal motion by interpolating between the neutral and maximally bent states.\n  Results: The pipeline was evaluated on a bendable 3D-printed lumbar spine phantom. The registration error was $1.941 \\pm 0.199$ mm and the interpolated spinal motion error was $2.01 \\pm 0.309$ mm (median).\n  Conclusion: The proposed robotic ultrasound framework enables radiation-reduced, real-time 3D visualization of spinal motion, offering a promising 3D alternative to conventional dynamic X-ray imaging for assessing spinal instability."}

However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness.

Once a fault occurs, locating the faulty string through manual string-by-string inspection is highly time-consuming and inefficient. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems. A PLECS-based simulation model that incorporates PV hysteresis effects is developed to generate diverse GF scenarios, from which correlation-based features are extracted throughout the inverter's four-stage shutdown sequence. Using the simulated dataset, a lightweight Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)-based localization model is designed and trained, achieving over 93% localization accuracy at typical sampling rates with low computational cost, demonstrating strong potential for deployment on resource-constrained PV inverters."}

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.\n  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions. The publicly available implementation facilitates reproducible research and extension to other brain tumours and neurological pathologies."}

We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment."}

Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation. Our results show that task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when task identity is defined functionally rather than parametrically."}

To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss."}

In this study, we investigated the potential of visible and hyperspectral imaging as cost-effective and quick-response alternatives to conventional chemical analyses for characterizing key properties of cowś milk. A total of 52 milk samples were analysed to determine their biochemical composition (polyphenols, antioxidant capacity, and fatty acids) using spectrophotometer methods and standard gas-liquid and high-performance liquid chromatography (GLC/HPLC). Concurrently, visible (RGB) images were captured using a standard smartphone, and hyperspectral data were acquired in the near-infrared range. A comprehensive analytical framework, including eleven different machine learning algorithms, was employed to correlate imaging features with biochemical measurements. Analysis of visible images accurately distinguished between fresh samples and those stored for 12 days (100 percent accuracy) and achieved perfect discrimination between antibiotic-treated and untreated groups (100 percent accuracy). Moreover, image-derived features enabled perfect prediction of the polyphenols content and the antioxidant capacity using an XGBoost model. Hyperspectral imaging further achieved classification accuracies exceeding 95 percent for several individual fatty acids and 94.8 percent for treatment groups using a Random Forest model. These findings demonstrate that both visible and hyperspectral imaging, when coupled with machine learning, are powerful, non-invasive tools for the rapid assessment of milkś chemical and nutritional profiles, highlighting the strong potential of imaging-based approaches for milk quality assessment."}

To address these issues, we propose RGAlign-Rec, a closed-loop alignment framework that integrates an LLM-based semantic reasoner with a Query-Enhanced (QE) ranking model. We also introduce Ranking-Guided Alignment (RGA), a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes downstream ranking signals as feedback to refine the LLM's latent reasoning. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset from Shopee demonstrate that RGAlign-Rec achieves a 0.12% gain in GAUC, leading to a significant 3.52% relative reduction in error rate, and a 0.56% improvement in Recall@3. Online A/B testing further validates the cumulative effectiveness of our framework: the Query-Enhanced model (QE-Rec) initially yields a 0.98% improvement in CTR, while the subsequent Ranking-Guided Alignment stage contributes an additional 0.13% gain. These results indicate that ranking-aware alignment effectively synchronizes semantic reasoning with ranking objectives, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and service quality in real-world proactive recommendation systems."}

By modeling anatomical structures and appearance variations with randomized Gaussian distributions, RaSD exposes models to sufficient multi-scale structural and appearance perturbations, forcing them to rely on invariant and task-relevant anatomical cues rather than dataset-specific textures, thereby enabling robust and transferable representation learning. We pre-trained RaSD on 1.2 million 3D volumes and 9.6 million 2D images, and extensively evaluated the resulting models across 6 imaging modalities, 48 datasets, and 56 downstream tasks.

We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature."}

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods."}

To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic. Leveraging the regularity of RQE, we prove that this approach achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees.

We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time.

To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks.

We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity."}

These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\n  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability.

A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference."}

In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines."}

In the UK, one in four people belongs to an ethnic minority, and dementia prevalence is expected to rise most rapidly among Black and Asian communities. This study examines the trustworthiness of AI models, specifically the presence of bias, in detecting healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort, to make these tools clinically beneficial. For experiments, monolingual participants were recruited nationally (UK), and multilingual speakers were enrolled from four community centres in Sheffield and Bradford. In addition to a non-native English accent, multilinguals spoke Somali, Chinese, or South Asian languages, who were further divided into two Yorkshire accents (West and South) to challenge the efficiency of the AI tools thoroughly. Although ASR systems showed no significant bias across groups, classification and regression models using acoustic and linguistic features exhibited bias against multilingual speakers, particularly in memory, fluency, and reading tasks. This bias was more pronounced when models were trained on the publicly available DementiaBank dataset. Moreover, multilinguals were more likely to be misclassified as having cognitive decline. This study is the first of its kind to discover that, despite their strong overall performance, current AI models show bias against multilingual individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK, and they are also more likely to misclassify speakers with a certain accent (South Yorkshire) as living with a more severe cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we conclude that the existing AI tools are therefore not yet reliable for diagnostic use in these populations, and we aim to address this in future work by developing more generalisable, bias-mitigated models."}

To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency.

Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding.

The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories."}

While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time.

We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns.

Motivated by Matryoshka Embeddings, our method performs static spatial pooling - including a lightweight sliding-window averaging variant - over patch embeddings to produce compact tile-level and global representations for fast candidate generation, followed by exact MaxSim reranking using full multi-vector embeddings.\n  Our design yields a quadratic reduction in vector-to-vector comparisons by reducing stored vectors per page from thousands to dozens, notably without requiring post-training, adapters, or distillation. Across experiments with interaction-style models such as ColPali and ColSmol-500M, we observe that over the limited ViDoRe v2 benchmark corpus 2-stage retrieval typically preserves NDCG and Recall @ 5/10 with minimal degradation, while substantially improving throughput (approximately 4x QPS); with sensitivity mainly at very large k. The toolkit additionally provides robust preprocessing - high resolution PDF to image conversion, optional margin/empty-region cropping and token hygiene (indexing only visual tokens) - and a reproducible evaluation pipeline, enabling rapid exploration of two-, three-, and cascaded retrieval variants. By emphasizing efficiency at common cutoffs (e.g., k <= 10), the toolkit lowers hardware barriers and makes state-of-the-art visual retrieval more accessible in practice."}

The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings."}

This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \\textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B.

Although rigorous, these approaches require large samples and may be constrained by data availability and cross-cultural comparability. Recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the semantic structure of questionnaire items may encode latent construct organization, offering a complementary response-free perspective. We introduce a topic-modeling framework that operationalizes semantic latent structure for scale simplification. Items are encoded using contextual sentence embeddings and grouped via density-based clustering to discover latent semantic factors without predefining their number. Class-based term weighting derives interpretable topic representations that approximate constructs and enable merging of semantically adjacent clusters. Representative items are selected using membership criteria within an integrated reduction pipeline. We benchmarked the framework across DASS, IPIP, and EPOCH, evaluating structural recovery, internal consistency, factor congruence, correlation preservation, and reduction efficiency. The proposed method recovered coherent factor-like groupings aligned with established constructs. Selected items reduced scale length by 60.5% on average while maintaining psychometric adequacy. Simplified scales showed high concordance with original factor structures and preserved inter-factor correlations, indicating that semantic latent organization provides a response-free approximation of measurement structure. Our framework formalizes semantic structure as an inspectable front-end for scale construction and reduction. To facilitate adoption, we provide a visualization-supported tool enabling one-click semantic analysis and structured simplification."}

Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs."}

We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\n  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial."}

Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \\textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency."}

To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding."}

This structural regularization induces controlled encoder-decoder information flow and stabilizes joint optimization. Across single-task denoising and joint denoising-classification settings, AddUNet achieves competitive reconstruction performance with improved training stability. In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination. Notably, reconstruction remains robust even under limited classification capacity, indicating implicit task decoupling through additive fusion. These findings show that simple constraints on skip connections act as an effective architectural regularizer for stable and scalable multi-task learning without increasing model complexity."}

Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model."}

Accordingly, we propose a regularization-sharpness tradeoff for overparameterized linear regression with an $\\ell^p$ penalty. Inspired by the interpolating information criterion, our framework decomposes the selection penalty into a regularization term (quantifying the alignment of the regularizer and the interpolator) and a geometric sharpness term on the interpolating manifold (quantifying the effect of local perturbations), yielding a tradeoff analogous to bias-variance. Building on prior analyses that established this information criterion for ridge regularizers, this work first provides a general expression of the interpolating information criterion for $\\ell^p$ regularizers where $p \\ge 2$. Subsequently, we extend this to the LASSO interpolator with $\\ell^1$ regularizer, which induces stronger sparsity. Empirical results on real-world datasets with random Fourier features and polynomials validate our theory, demonstrating how the tradeoff terms can distinguish performant linear interpolators from weaker ones."}

We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions."}

Code and datasets available at: https://github.com/rubenpjove/CP-HOSfing", "summary": "Operating System (OS) fingerprinting is critical for network security, but conventional methods do not provide formal uncertainty quantification mechanisms. Conformal Prediction (CP) could be directly wrapped around existing methods to obtain prediction sets with guaranteed coverage. However, a direct application of CP would treat OS identification as a flat classification problem, ignoring the natural taxonomic structure of OSs and providing brittle point predictions. This work addresses these limitations by introducing and evaluating two distinct structured CP strategies: level-wise CP (L-CP), which calibrates each hierarchy level independently, and projection-based CP (P-CP), which ensures structural consistency by projecting leaf-level sets upwards. Our results demonstrate that, while both methods satisfy validity guarantees, they expose a fundamental trade-off between level-wise efficiency and structural consistency. L-CP yields tighter prediction sets suitable for human forensic analysis but suffers from taxonomic inconsistencies. Conversely, P-CP guarantees hierarchically consistent, nested sets ideal for automated policy enforcement, albeit at the cost of reduced efficiency at coarser levels."}

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained."}

More precisely, the agents' valuations are given by the inner product of a context vector with two unknown $d$-dimensional vectors -- one for the buyers and one for the sellers.\n  At each time step $t$, the learner receives a context and posts two prices, one for the seller and one for the buyer, and the trade happens if both agents accept their price. We study two objectives for this problem, gain from trade and profit, proving no-regret with respect to a surprisingly strong benchmark: the best omniscient dynamic strategy.\n  In the natural scenario where the learner observes \\emph{separately} whether the agents accept their price -- the so-called \\emph{two-bit} feedback -- we design algorithms that achieve $O(d\\log d)$ regret for gain from trade, and $O(d \\log\\log T + d\\log d)$ regret for profit maximization.

As a final set of results, we investigate the combination of one-bit feedback and per-step budget balance.

In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI).

Observed clicks reflect a mixture of users' intrinsic preferences and the uplift induced by these interventions.

Furthermore, marketing interventions often operate as multi-valued treatments with varying magnitudes, introducing additional complexity to CTR prediction.\n  To address these issues, we propose the \\textbf{Uni}fied \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}alued \\textbf{T}reatment Network (UniMVT).

To handle the complexity of multi-valued treatments, UniMVT employs an auxiliary intensity estimation task to capture treatment propensities and devise a unit uplift objective that normalizes the intervention effect. This ensures comparable estimation across the continuous coupon-value spectrum. UniMVT simultaneously achieves debiased CTR prediction for accurate system calibration and precise uplift estimation for incentive allocation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and industrial datasets demonstrate UniMVT's superiority in both predictive accuracy and calibration. Furthermore, real-world A/B tests confirm that UniMVT significantly improves business metrics through more effective coupon distribution."}

However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone.

While the geometries underlying OPGD and OEG, both special cases of OMD, are well understood, it remains a challenging open question on how to construct an optimal mirror map for any given constrained set and a general family of loss functions, e.g., sparse losses. Motivated by parameterizing a near-optimal set of mirror maps, we consider a simpler question: is it even possible to obtain polynomial gains in regret by using mirror maps for geometries that interpolate between $L_1$ and $L_2$, which may not be possible by restricting to only OEG ($L_1$) or OPGD ($L_2$).\n  Our main result answers this question positively. We show that mirror maps based on block norms adapt better to the sparsity of loss functions, compared to previous $L_p$ (for $p \\in [1, 2]$) interpolations. In particular, we construct a family of online convex optimization instances in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where block norm-based mirror maps achieve a provable polynomial (in $d$) improvement in regret over OEG and OPGD for sparse loss functions. We then turn to the setting in which the sparsity level of the loss functions is unknown. In this case, the choice of geometry itself becomes an online decision problem. We first show that naively switching between OEG and OPGD can incur linear regret, highlighting the intrinsic difficulty of geometry selection. To overcome this issue, we propose a meta-algorithm based on multiplicative weights that dynamically selects among a family of uniform block norms. We show that this approach effectively tunes OMD to the sparsity of the losses, yielding adaptive regret guarantees. Overall, our results demonstrate that online mirror-map selection can significantly enhance the ability of OMD to exploit sparsity in online convex optimization."}

For projected climate data, use of different General Circulation Models (GCM) simulates contrasting results. This study shows selection of GCM for the latest generation CMIP6 for hydroclimate change impact studies. Envelope based method was used for the selection, which includes components based on machine learning techniques, allowing the selection of GCMs without the need for in-situ reference data. According to our knowledge, for the first time, such a comparison was performed for the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios data. In addition, the effect of climate change under SSP scenarios was studied, along with the calculation of extreme indices. Finally, GCMs were compared to quantify spatiotemporal differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 data. Results provide NorESM2 LM, FGOALS g3 as selected models for the Jhelum and Chenab River. Highly vulnerable regions under the effect of climate change were highlighted through spatial maps, which included parts of Punjab, Jammu, and Kashmir. Upon comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6, no discernible difference was found between the RCP and SSP scenarios precipitation projections. In the future, more detailed statistical comparisons could further reinforce the proposition."}

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively."}
