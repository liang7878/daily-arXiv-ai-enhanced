### [1] [Sketch2BIM: A Multi-Agent Human-AI Collaborative Pipeline to Convert Hand-Drawn Floor Plans to 3D BIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20838)
*Abir Khan Ratul,Sanjay Acharjee,Somin Park,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出人在环管道将手绘平面图草图转换为3D BIM模型，利用MLLM和多智能体框架，实验效果好，让BIM创建更易上手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使仅通过徒手草图创建BIM模型对专家和非专家都更易实现。

Method: 采用人在环管道，在多智能体框架中利用多模态大语言模型，结合感知提取、人类反馈、模式验证和自动BIM脚本。

Result: 在十个不同平面图实验中，开口捕捉可靠性高，墙检测初始约83%，经反馈迭代接近完美对齐，各项指标表现好，几何误差逐渐降为零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理可让仅用徒手草图创建BIM模型对专家和非专家都变得可行。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

### [2] [Cultural Alien Sampler: Open-ended art generation balancing originality and coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20849)
*Alejandro H. Artiles,Hiromu Yakura,Levin Brinkmann,Mar Canet Sola,Hassan Abu Alhaija,Ignacio Serna,Nasim Rahaman,Bernhard Schölkopf,Iyad Rahwan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文引入文化异类采样器（CAS）解决大语言模型在艺术领域创意生成问题，经评估表现优于基线，能解锁自主智能体创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在开放式艺术领域生成想法时，要么遵循熟悉文化模式，要么追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性，需解决此问题。

Method: 引入文化异类采样器（CAS），使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT - 2模型，分别评估概念连贯性和文化典型性，目标是选择高连贯性和低典型性的组合。

Result: 在人类评估中，该方法优于随机选择和GPT - 4o基线，在原创性和协调性上与人类艺术学生相当；定量研究表明其输出更多样，探索概念空间更广。

Conclusion: 人为的文化异类性可以解锁自主智能体的创造潜力。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

### [3] [Fuzzy numbers revisited: operations on extensional fuzzy numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20861)
*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨模糊数运算问题，提出用扩展模糊数解决，定义其运算和关系运算符，给出应用示例及C++实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在计算复杂度高、结果特征改变和模糊扩散等问题，限制了其应用领域，因此需新方法解决。

Method: 引入扩展模糊数，定义其运算和关系运算符。

Result: 给出了扩展模糊数运算和关系运算符的定义，并通过多个应用示例进行说明，且有C++实现。

Conclusion: 扩展模糊数为解决传统模糊数运算问题提供了新途径，有望拓展模糊数的应用领域。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

### [4] [Customizing Open Source LLMs for Quantitative Medication Attribute Extraction across Heterogeneous EHR Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21027)
*Zhe Fei,Mehmet Yigit Turali,Shreyas Rajesh,Xinyang Dai,Huyen Pham,Pavan Holur,Yuhui Zhu,Larissa Mooney,Yih-Ing Hser,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出定制开源大语言模型框架从异构电子病历系统提取美沙酮维持治疗处方属性并计算标准化指标，在多诊所数据评估，大模型表现佳，指出常见问题及修复方法，能实现跨站点分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子病历系统中药物数据不统一阻碍了阿片类药物使用障碍药物监测，需解决异构系统中关键处方属性分散问题。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma），按固定JSON模式处理记录，进行轻量级归一化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在五家诊所数据评估，大模型表现佳，Qwen2.5 - 32B覆盖率93.4%、精确匹配准确率93.0%，MedGemma - 27B为93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法去除特定站点ETL，支持本地隐私保护部署，可在现实环境中对美沙酮维持治疗暴露、依从性和保留率进行一致的跨站点分析。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

### [5] [Epistemic Deference to AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21043)
*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章探讨何时应听从AI输出而非人类专家判断，提出AI先发制人主义有缺陷，更推崇总证据观点，该观点有三方面优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨何时应听从AI输出而非人类专家判断，基于社会认识论认为部分AI系统可作为人工认知权威。

Method: 先引入AI先发制人主义，指出经典反对意见对AEA更适用，再提出总证据观点。

Result: 总证据观点能减轻专业能力萎缩，为人类监督控制提供认知依据，解释可靠性条件不满足时对AI的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 总证据观点提供了一种原则性方法来判断何时听从AI是合理的，尤其在高风险、对可靠性要求高的情境中。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

### [6] [From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045)
*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出多智能体框架将自然语言问题转化为空间 SQL 查询，经评估有较高准确率，让空间分析更易获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL 复杂性和地理空间函数专业性给非专家分析空间数据带来障碍，单智能体处理空间查询有困难。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，含知识库、嵌入、协作多智能体管道，管道有多种专业智能体及审核智能体进行验证。

Result: 在 KaggleDBQA 上准确率 81.2%，空间查询准确率 87.7%，比无审核智能体时高，部分查询语义更贴合用户意图。

Conclusion: 该工作让空间分析更易获取，为空间文本到 SQL 系统提供基础，推动自主 GIS 发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了MedAlign框架解决LVLMs用于临床服务的挑战，在Med - VQA数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）用于临床服务存在易产生幻觉答案、固定深度推理效率低和多机构协作困难三个关键挑战，需解决这些问题。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化（mDPO）目标；设计检索感知混合专家（RA - MoE）架构；提出联邦治理机制，通过本地元认知不确定性估计器进行迭代思维链（CoT）推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med - VQA数据集上实验，MedAlign达到了最先进的性能，F1分数比强检索增强基线高出11.85%，与固定深度CoT方法相比，平均推理长度减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架有效解决了LVLMs用于临床服务的挑战，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复杂高维且无法排除未观测混杂因素的领域中，如何从有偏数据进行离线策略学习。

Method: 基于深度Q网络（DQN），提出在与观测兼容的最坏环境中寻找安全策略的算法。

Result: 在12个混淆Atari游戏中，当行为策略和目标策略的观测输入不匹配且存在未观测混杂因素时，该算法始终优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在处理有偏数据和存在未观测混杂因素的复杂高维领域中是有效的。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开展去中心化治理中能动AI作为自主决策者的首次实证研究。

Method: 利用主要协议的超3K个提案构建能动AI选民，在基于可验证区块链数据的金融模拟环境中运行，通过模块化可组合程序（MCP）工作流实现。

Result: 能动AI的决策与人类和代币加权结果有很强的一致性。

Conclusion: 能动AI可在现实DAO治理中增强集体决策，有助于为去中心化金融系统设计可解释且经济严谨的AI智能体。

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

*Jihyun Lee,Yejin Min,San Kim,Yejin Jeon,SungJun Yang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文引入数据集PACE，训练咨询模型PACER，并提出评估框架PanicEval，实验表明PACER表现优于基线模型，人类评估也证实其实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因伦理和后勤问题，用于训练恐慌发作干预模型的合适数据集稀缺，需要解决此问题。

Method: 引入包含高压力情节的数据集PACE，基于该数据训练咨询模型PACER，通过监督学习和模拟偏好对齐进行优化，提出多维度评估框架PanicEval。

Result: PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情绪改善方面均优于强基线模型，人类评估中在恐慌场景下比通用、基于CBT和GPT - 4驱动的模型更受青睐。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌发作干预方面具有有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm
).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，利用LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，实验取得高POSR且解决知识冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击忽略模型内部表示动态和神经元敏感性，RAG中毒机制未充分研究，未考虑知识冲突。

Method: 先识别与上下文中毒知识强相关的Poison - Responsive Neurons，再用遗传算法进化最大化激活这些神经元的对抗性段落，通过归因信号识别和复用有潜力的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多模型和数据集上实验，持续实现超90%的高POSR，保留流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决知识冲突。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

TL;DR: 提出EGO - Prompt框架用于设计大语言模型的提示和推理过程，经测试效果优于前沿方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定领域任务中，设计大语言模型的最优提示和推理过程必要且具挑战性，如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率等问题有待解决。

Method: EGO - Prompt框架从通用提示和初始语义因果图描述开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程分两步优化，迭代优化算法进一步完善因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上测试，F1比前沿方法高7.32% - 12.61%，小模型能用不到20%成本达到大模型性能，输出精炼的特定领域因果图。

Conclusion: EGO - Prompt框架在设计大语言模型提示和推理过程上表现良好，能提高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

TL;DR: 现有预训练视觉语言模型在实际部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，本文提出轻量级无记忆的持续学习框架NuSA - CL，实验表明其能保留零样本迁移能力且表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在实际部署中面临分布偏移和新任务，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 引入NuSA - CL框架，采用低秩自适应，将特定任务的权重更新限制在模型当前参数的近似零空间内。

Result: 框架有效保留零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准测试中表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: NuSA - CL是实际应用中不断发展的零样本视觉语言模型的实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有因果关系发现方法易出错、依赖大量数据，且多元时间序列存在数据缺口，易过拟合。

Method: 提出Shylock方法，用组扩张卷积和共享核减少参数，结合全局和局部约束实现网络信息共享；设计带时间延迟的多元时间序列数据生成方法。

Result: 在常用基准和生成数据集上评估，Shylock在少样本和正常多元时间序列上优于两种现有先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock能有效解决多元时间序列因果关系发现问题，且开发的Tcausal库便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Conclusion: 本工作向适用于现实应用的更通用、更强大智能体迈进了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Conclusion: 概述了多领域和应用中自主系统安全开发和运行的挑战及未来工作。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

TL;DR: 本文评估多种自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略，推荐新策略λ = 2·σ，该策略在多任务中表现优于现有策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度不具有无关性，许多游戏有精心挑选的奖励尺度，导致节点Q值在不同游戏中跨度不同，因此需评估自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略。

Method: 评估文献中提出的以及五个新的λ - 策略。

Result: 新建议的λ - 策略（λ = 2·σ）在单参数值和优化所有可用参数获得的峰值性能方面，在广泛任务中优于现有λ - 策略。

Conclusion: 推荐使用新建议的λ - 策略（λ = 2·σ）。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试中，CoG显著提高了当前大推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架能有效解决大推理模型的安全 - 推理权衡问题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议记录进行范围审查，系统分析可信性的定义、操作化和应用。

Result: 定义技术属性有进展，但存在重技术精度、轻社会伦理的差距，AI系统的社会技术性质探索不足，可信性概念有争议。

Conclusion: 跨学科方法对推进可信AI至关重要，建议AI伦理社区采用整体框架促进负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

Result: 在RLBench和现实场景实验中，相比Code - as - Policies基线，任务成功率提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性超86.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Conclusion: CXRAgent是一种有效的CXR解读方法，代码和数据可通过指定链接获取。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

Motivation: 大语言模型生成创新想法能力不足，现有搜索方法依赖无原则的自我评估启发式。

Method: 引入Magellan框架，采用MCTS，用“语义指南针”向量进行远程引导，用景观感知价值函数进行局部决策。

Result: Magellan在生成科学想法上显著优于ReAct和ToT等基线。

Conclusion: 有原则的引导搜索对创造性发现更有效，为大语言模型成为创新伙伴奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

Result: SFT+RL模型在GSM8K数据集上表现更好，减少超40%的token使用，准确率更高。

Conclusion: 强化学习能弥补长上下文训练的损失，提升数学推理性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: 为符号集成到LLM的框架实施提供实用见解以增强透明度。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Motivation: 现有多任务VRP神经方法未充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，未发挥基础求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 提出框架，引入State - Decomposable MDP（SDMDP），开发基于潜在空间的SDMDP扩展，实现Mixture - of - Specialized - Experts Solver（MoSES）。

Result: 在VRP变体上的大量实验表明MoSES优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架和MoSES求解器能有效解决现有多任务VRP神经方法的局限性，提升求解性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Motivation: 测量大语言模型代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行动的潜在倾向，解决其不可预测行为问题。

Result: 发布公开预览集，保留私有测试集，发布代码。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来将代理安全基准扩展到不同法律管辖区、多轮和多语言交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的智能体长时推理中中间推理验证不足的问题。

Method: 采用Conflict - Aware Meta - Verification (CAMV)和Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF)两种互补机制，形成闭环验证。

Result: Co - Sight在GAIA、Humanity's Last Exam和Chinese - SimpleQA数据集上取得先进准确性，消融实验证明结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证协同带来提升。

Conclusion: Co - Sight为基于大语言模型的智能体可靠长时推理提供可扩展范式。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习神经CBF的方法中，失败状态集难明确指定，而专家演示集易生成，需新方法。

Method: 用ICL训练约束函数对系统状态分类为安全和不安全，用该函数标注模拟轨迹来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中评估，该方法优于现有基线，与用真实安全标签标注数据训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能在失败状态集不明确时训练神经CBF。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设软件基准性能高意味着更有前景的自我修改，但存在代理自我改进潜力与编码基准性能的不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标，引入HGM，通过估计CMP来搜索自我修改树。

Result: 在SWE - bench Verified和Polyglot上，HGM优于先前方法且用时少，对其他编码数据集和大语言模型有强迁移性，优化后的代理达到人类水平性能。

Conclusion: HGM在自我改进编码代理开发中是有效的，代码开源可促进相关研究。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Motivation: 现有AI智能体基准在多方面存在不足，需要更严格的基准来评估智能体以推动科研生产力进步。

Method: 定义原则和工具，提出AstaBench套件，该套件包含超2400个问题，提供科研环境和多种智能体及基线。

Result: 对57个智能体进行广泛评估，发现AI在某些方面有进展，但远不能解决科研辅助挑战。

Conclusion: AI虽有进步，但目前还难以解决科研辅助的难题，仍需进一步发展。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

TL;DR: 本文提出首个端到端复杂多本体匹配策略CMOMgen，在生物医学任务中评估显示其表现优于基线方法，能构建语义合理的映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简单等价映射无法实现相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要复杂多本体匹配方法。

Method: 提出CMOMgen策略，利用检索增强生成选择相关类来构建映射，过滤匹配参考映射作为示例增强上下文学习。

Result: CMOMgen在类选择上优于基线，F1分数至少达63%，在三项任务中两项表现最佳，一项排第二，手动评估显示46%非参考映射获最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen是有效的复杂多本体匹配策略，能构建语义合理的映射。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Method: 引入从Facebook和YouTube获取的专家标注视频广告基准数据集，对来自20个国家超50家公司或倡导组织的广告按13种框架类型标注。

Result: 基线实验有一定成果，GPT - 4.1检测环境信息F1分数达79%，最佳模型识别绿色创新框架F1分数仅46%。

Conclusion: 数据集有助于能源领域战略传播的多模态分析，同时指出视觉语言模型需解决的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，还是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态的协调器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

Result: 巴黎定律常数学习结果与文献数据相似，能预测裂纹扩展速率计算裂纹尺寸。

Conclusion: 提出的PIML模型可对激光熔合材料裂纹尺寸和扩展进行现实且可解释的预测。

Abstract: Fatigue behaviors of metal components by laser fusion suffer from scattering
due to random geometrical defects (e.g., porosity, lack of fusion). Monitoring
fatigue crack initiation and growth is critical, especially for laser-fused
components with significant inherent fatigue scattering. Conventional
statistics-based curve-fitting fatigue models have difficulty incorporating
significant scattering in their fatigue life due to the random geometrical
defects. A scattering-informed predictive method is needed for laser-fused
materials' crack size and growth. Current data-driven machine learning could
circumvent the issue of deterministic modeling, but results in a black-box
function that lacks interpretability. To address these challenges, this study
explores a novel nondimensionalized physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
model to predict fatigue crack growth of laser-fused SS-316L by integrating
fatigue laws and constraints with small data to ensure a realistic and
interpretable prediction. Resonance process signature data were leveraged with
Paris's law to train the PIML model without experimental crack growth data. The
results show that Paris's law constants can be learned with good similarity to
comparable data from the literature, and the crack growth rate can be predicted
to compute crack sizes.

Abstract: In this work, algorithms for the parallel computation of three-body
interactions in molecular dynamics are developed. While traversals for the
computation of pair interactions are readily available in the literature, here,
such traversals are extended to allow for the computation between molecules
stored across three cells. A general framework for the computation of
three-body interactions in linked cells is described, and then used to
implement the corresponding traversals. In addition, our analysis is combined
with the commonly used cutoff conditions, because they influence the total
workload of the computation of interactions. The combinations between
traversals and truncation conditions are validated using the well-known
Lennard-Jones fluid. Validation case studies are taken from the literature and
configured into homogeneous and inhomogeneous scenarios. Finally, strong
scalability and performance in terms of molecule updates are measured at
node-level.

Motivation: Foursquare数据集部分条目元数据不全且有虚假位置，OSM虽元数据丰富但未验证是否为实际业务，需结合两者优势。

Method: 通过计算Foursquare和OSM的POI名称相似度得分和空间距离进行记录链接，识别并保留高置信度匹配。

Result: 生成约1TB组合数据集，提供过滤版本降低存储需求，构建图表示的POI用于分析和应用。

Conclusion: 结合Foursquare和OSM数据集的方法可行，生成的过滤数据集及图表示可用于高级空间分析和下游应用。

Abstract: Recently, Foursquare released a global dataset with more than 100 million
points of interest (POIs), each representing a real-world business on its
platform. However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or
categories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In
contrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with
detailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify
whether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a
methodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a
comprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched
metadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full
version is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable
thresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download
and use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce
the full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity
scores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures
identify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses
in Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.
Finally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation
of POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial
analyses and a range of downstream applications.

for training and inference for GenAI. Hence, an update to this survey is due.
This paper is an update of the survey of AI accelerators and processors from
past seven years, which is called the Lincoln AI Computing Survey -- LAICS
(pronounced "lace"). This multi-year survey collects and summarizes the current
commercial accelerators that have been publicly announced with peak performance
and peak power consumption numbers. In the same tradition of past papers of
this survey, the performance and power values are plotted on a scatter graph,
and a number of dimensions and observations from the trends on this plot are
again discussed and analyzed. Market segments are highlighted on the scatter
plot, and zoomed plots of each segment are also included. A brief description
of each of the new accelerators that have been added in the survey this year is
included, and this update features a new categorization of computing
architectures that implement each of the accelerators.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables scalable training on edge devices by
combining the parallelism of Federated Learning (FL) with the computational
offloading of Split Learning (SL). Despite its great success, SFL suffers
significantly from the well-known straggler issue in distributed learning
systems. This problem is exacerbated by the dependency between Split Server and
clients: the Split Server side model update relies on receiving activations
from clients. Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time
latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and
efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a
straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples
training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced
update mechanism.
  By enabling the server to perform $\tau$ local updates per client round,
MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{d/(\tau T)})$ for
non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\tau$ in
communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate that MU-SplitFed consistently
outperforms baseline methods with the presence of stragglers and effectively
mitigates their impact through adaptive tuning of $\tau$. The code for this
project is available at https://github.com/Johnny-Zip/MU-SplitFed.

Abstract: Cloud computing has been consolidated as a support for the vast majority of
current and emerging technologies. However, there are some barriers that
prevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the
major cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms
that ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.
However, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud
provider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined
to ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are
bound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and
prevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud
environments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically
translating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured
across multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent
knowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs
defined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral
metrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).
Secondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can
be measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation
based on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by
leading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the
complementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and
transparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed
by the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generative adversarial network and federated
learning-based model to address various challenges of the smart prediction and
recommendation applications, such as high response time, compromised data
privacy, and data scarcity. The integration of the generative adversarial
network and federated learning is referred to as Generative Federated Learning
(GFL). As a case study of the proposed model, a heart health monitoring
application is considered. The realistic synthetic datasets are generated using
the generated adversarial network-based proposed algorithm for improving data
diversity, data quality, and data augmentation, and remove the data scarcity
and class imbalance issues. In this paper, we implement the centralized and
decentralized federated learning approaches in an edge computing paradigm. In
centralized federated learning, the edge nodes communicate with the central
server to build the global and personalized local models in a collaborative
manner. In the decentralized federated learning approach, the edge nodes
communicate among themselves to exchange model updates for collaborative
training. The comparative study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
the existing heart health monitoring applications. The results show that using
the proposed framework (i) the prediction accuracy is improved by 12% than the
conventional framework, and (ii) the response time is reduced by 73% than the
conventional cloud-only system.

Result: 证明AFC定理，指出一致性模型中的对象规范可实现可用实现的充要条件是无仲裁。

Conclusion: AFC定理统一并推广先前结果，无仲裁性是关键属性。

Abstract: The fundamental tension between \emph{availability} and \emph{consistency}
shapes the design of distributed storage systems. Classical results capture
extreme points of this trade-off: the CAP theorem shows that strong models like
linearizability preclude availability under partitions, while weak models like
causal consistency remain implementable without coordination. These theorems
apply to simple read-write interfaces, leaving open a precise explanation of
the combinations of object semantics and consistency models that admit
available implementations.
  This paper develops a general semantic framework in which storage
specifications combine operation semantics and consistency models. The
framework encompasses a broad range of objects (key-value stores, counters,
sets, CRDTs, and transactional databases) and consistency models (from causal
consistency and sequential consistency to snapshot isolation and transactional
and non-transactional SQL).
  Within this framework, we prove the \emph{Arbitration-Free Consistency} (AFC)
theorem, showing that an object specification within a consistency model admits
an available implementation if and only if it is \emph{arbitration-free}, that
is, it does not require a total arbitration order to resolve visibility or read
dependencies.
  The AFC theorem unifies and generalizes previous results, revealing
arbitration-freedom as the fundamental property that delineates
coordination-free consistency from inherently synchronized behavior.

Result: 可采取主动措施防止硬限制被突破，改善了节点变动时的系统稳定性，对参数值有了合理的解释。

Conclusion: Parsley的设计和参数选择能有效提升系统性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Parsley is a resilient group-based Distributed Hash Table that incorporates a
preemptive peer relocation technique and a dynamic data sharding mechanism to
enhance robustness and balance. In addition to the hard limits on group size,
defined by minimum and maximum thresholds, Parsley introduces two soft limits
that define a target interval for maintaining stable group sizes. These soft
boundaries allow the overlay to take proactive measures to prevent violations
of the hard limits, improving system stability under churn. This work provides
an in-depth analysis of the rationale behind the parameter values adopted for
Parsley's evaluation. Unlike related systems, which specify group size limits
without justification, we conduct a systematic overlay characterization study
to understand the effects of these parameters on performance and scalability.
The study examines topology operations, the behavior of large groups, and the
overall trade-offs observed, offering a grounded explanation for the chosen
configuration values.

Conclusion: 所提出的去中心化控制平面方法具有多方面优势，适合在地理分布式计算平台中使用。

Abstract: Scientific communities are increasingly using geographically distributed
computing platforms. The current methods of compute placement predominantly use
logically centralized controllers such as Kubernetes (K8s) to match tasks to
available resources. However, this centralized approach is unsuitable in
multi-organizational collaborations. Furthermore, workflows often need to use
manual configurations tailored for a single platform and cannot adapt to
dynamic changes across infrastructure. Our work introduces a decentralized
control plane for placing computations on geographically dispersed compute
clusters using semantic names. We assign semantic names to computations to
match requests with named Kubernetes (K8s) service endpoints. We show that this
approach provides multiple benefits. First, it allows placement of
computational jobs to be independent of location, enabling any cluster with
sufficient resources to execute the computation. Second, it facilitates dynamic
compute placement without requiring prior knowledge of cluster locations or
predefined configurations.

Conclusion: 展示了在多站点集群上使用监督学习进行实时、网络感知作业调度的可行性。

Abstract: Distributed cloud environments hosting data-intensive applications often
experience slowdowns due to network congestion, asymmetric bandwidth, and
inter-node data shuffling. These factors are typically not captured by
traditional host-level metrics like CPU or memory. Scheduling without
accounting for these conditions can lead to poor placement decisions, longer
data transfers, and suboptimal job performance. We present a network-aware job
scheduler that uses supervised learning to predict the completion time of
candidate jobs. Our system introduces a prediction-and-ranking mechanism that
collects real-time telemetry from all nodes, uses a trained supervised model to
estimate job duration per node, and ranks them to select the best placement. We
evaluate the scheduler on a geo-distributed Kubernetes cluster deployed on the
FABRIC testbed by running network-intensive Spark workloads. Compared to the
default Kubernetes scheduler, which makes placement decisions based on current
resource availability alone, our proposed supervised scheduler achieved 34-54%
higher accuracy in selecting optimal nodes for job placement. The novelty of
our work lies in the demonstration of supervised learning for real-time,
network-aware job scheduling on a multi-site cluster.

Abstract: Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions and
events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri's general systems theory. Defined
by four parameters they provide an algebraic formalism to describe strongly
synchronized sequential processes. To further investigate their structure,
reduction systems of cycloids are defined in the style of rewriting systems and
properties of irreducible cycloids are proved. In particular the synthesis of
cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure is derived, leading to an
efficient method for a decision procedure for cycloid isomorphism.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The distributed coloring problem is arguably one of the key problems studied
in the area of distributed graph algorithms. The most standard variant of the
problem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\Delta+1$ colors,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of
work on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining
the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message
passing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In
this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity
of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\Delta$ in a special family of
graphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The
neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise
non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of
neighborhood independence $\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$
rounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show
that in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$, a $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
can be computed in $(\theta\cdot\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta /
\log\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time
in $\Delta$ as long as $\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\Delta$. We also
show that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\Delta$
algorithm for $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of
hypergraphs of rank at least $3$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We obtain hardness of approximation results for the $\ell_p$-Shortest Path
problem, a variant of the classic Shortest Path problem with vector costs. For
every integer $p \in [2,\infty)$, we show a hardness of $\Omega(p(\log n /
\log^2\log n)^{1-1/p})$ for both polynomial- and quasi-polynomial-time
approximation algorithms. This nearly matches the approximation factor of
$O(p(\log n / \log\log n)^{1-1/p})$ achieved by a quasi-polynomial-time
algorithm of Makarychev, Ovsiankin, and Tani (ICALP 2025). No hardness of
approximation results were previously known for any $p < \infty$. We also
present results for the case where $p$ is a function of $n$. For $p = \infty$,
we establish a hardness of $\tilde\Omega(\log^2 n)$, improving upon the
previous $\tilde\Omega(\log n)$ hardness result. Our result nearly matches the
$O(\log^2 n)$ approximation guarantee of the quasi-polynomial-time algorithm by
Li, Xu, and Zhang (ICALP 2025). Finally, we present asymptotic bounds on
higher-order Bell numbers, which might be of independent interest.

Method: 设计元算法，将精确子模最大化的“鲁棒”算法作为黑盒进行转换。

Result: 结合测量连续贪心算法，在有拟阵约束下对单调（非单调）子模最大化分别得到(1 - 1/e)（1/e）近似；结合双贪心算法，在无约束非单调子模最大化下得到1/2近似。

Conclusion: 所设计的元算法能有效将精确算法转换到噪声环境并保持近似保证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a
noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar
to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple
calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this
model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm
for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and
Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone
submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this
paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm
for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an
algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By
using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we
obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone
(resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint
under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy
algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone)
submodular maximization under noise.

Conclusion: Morell和Skutella猜想与Goemans猜想有蕴含关系，推广技术有更广泛应用价值。

Abstract: A famous conjecture of Goemans on single-source unsplittable flows states
that one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one of no higher
cost, while increasing the load on any arc by at most the maximum demand.
Despite extensive work on the topic, only limited progress has been made.
Recently, Morell and Skutella suggested an alternative conjecture, stating that
one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one without changing the
load on any arc by more than the maximum demand.
  We show that their conjecture implies Goemans' conjecture (with a violation
of twice the maximum demand). To this end, we generalize a technique of
Linhares and Swamy, used to obtain a low-cost chain-constrained spanning tree
from an algorithm without cost guarantees. Whereas Linhares and Swamy's proof
relies on Langrangian duality, we provide a very simple elementary proof of a
generalized version, which we hope to be of independent interest. Moreover, we
show how this technique can also be used in the context of the weighted ring
loading problem, showing that cost-unaware approximation algorithms can be
transformed into approximation algorithms with additional cost guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding the role of randomness when solving locally checkable labeling
(LCL) problems in the LOCAL model has been one of the top priorities in the
research on distributed graph algorithms in recent years. For LCL problems in
bounded-degree graphs, it is known that randomness cannot help more than
polynomially, except in one case: if the deterministic complexity of an LCL
problem is in $\Omega(\log n)$ and its randomized complexity is in $o(\log n)$,
then the randomized complexity is guaranteed to be $poly(\log \log n)$.
However, the fundamental question of \emph{which} problems with a deterministic
complexity of $\Omega(\log n)$ can be solved exponentially faster using
randomization still remains wide open.
  We make a step towards answering this question by studying a simple, but
natural class of LCL problems: so-called degree splitting problems. These
problems come in two varieties: coloring problems where the edges of a graph
have to be colored with $2$ colors and orientation problems where each edge
needs to be oriented. For $\Delta$-regular graphs (where $\Delta=O(1)$), we
obtain the following results.
  - We gave an exact characterization of the randomized complexity of all
problems where the edges need to be colored with two colors, say red and blue,
and which have a deterministic complexity of $O(\log n)$. - For edge
orientation problems, we give a partial characterization of the problems that
have a randomized complexity of $\Omega(\log n)$ and the problems that have a
randomized complexity of $poly\log\log n$.
  While our results are cleanest to state for the $\Delta$-regular case, all
our algorithms naturally generalize to nodes of any degree $d<\Delta$ in
general graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The problem of minimizing fuzzy interpretations in fuzzy description logics
(FDLs) is important both theoretically and practically. For instance, fuzzy or
weighted social networks can be modeled as fuzzy interpretations, where
individuals represent actors and roles capture interactions. Minimizing such
interpretations yields more compact representations, which can significantly
improve the efficiency of reasoning and analysis tasks in knowledge-based
systems. We present the first algorithm that minimizes a finite fuzzy
interpretation while preserving fuzzy concept assertions in FDLs without the
Baaz projection operator and the universal role, under the G\"odel semantics.
The considered class of FDLs ranges from the sublogic of $f\!\mathcal{ALC}$
without the union operator and universal restriction to the FDL that extends
$f\!\mathcal{ALC}_{reg}$ with inverse roles and nominals. Our algorithm is
given in an extended form that supports approximate preservation: it minimizes
a finite fuzzy interpretation $\mathcal{I}$ while preserving fuzzy concept
assertions up to a degree $\gamma \in (0,1]$. Its time complexity is
$O((m\log{l} + n)\log{n})$, where $n$ is the size of the domain of
$\mathcal{I}$, $m$ is the number of nonzero instances of atomic roles in
$\mathcal{I}$, and $l$ is the number of distinct fuzzy values used in such
instances plus 2.

Abstract: We study a network design problem motivated by the challenge of placing
wildlife crossings to reconnect fragmented habitats of animal species, which is
among the 17 goals towards sustainable development by the UN: Given a graph,
whose vertices represent the fragmented habitat areas and whose edges represent
possible green bridge locations (with costs), and the habitable vertex set for
each species' habitat, the goal is to find the cheapest set of edges such that
each species' habitat is sufficiently connected. We focus on the established
variant where a habitat is considered sufficiently connected if it has diameter
two in the solution and study its complexity in cases justified by our setting
namely small habitat sizes on planar graphs and graphs of small maximum degree
$\Delta$. We provide efficient algorithms and NP-hardness results for different
values of $\Delta$ and maximum habitat sizes on general and planar graphs.

Abstract: Narrowing the gap between theory and practice is a longstanding goal of the
algorithm analysis community. To further progress our understanding of how
algorithms work in practice, we propose a new algorithm analysis framework that
we call by the book analysis. In contrast to earlier frameworks, by the book
analysis not only models an algorithm's input data, but also the algorithm
itself. Results from by the book analysis are meant to correspond well with
established knowledge of an algorithm's practical behavior, as they are meant
to be grounded in observations from implementations, input modeling best
practices, and measurements on practical benchmark instances. We apply our
framework to the simplex method, an algorithm which is beloved for its
excellent performance in practice and notorious for its high running time under
worst-case analysis. The simplex method similarly showcased the state of the
art framework smoothed analysis (Spielman and Teng, STOC'01). We explain how
our framework overcomes several weaknesses of smoothed analysis and we prove
that under input scaling assumptions, feasibility tolerances and other design
principles used by simplex method implementations, the simplex method indeed
attains a polynomial running time.

Conclusion: 在本文设定下总能形成低成本、公平且有代表性的委员会。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a representative committee of $k$ agents
from a collection of $n$ agents in a common metric space. This problem is
related to choosing $k$ facilities in facility location and $k$-median
problems. However, unlike in more traditional facility location where each
agent only cares about the closest selected facility, in the settings we
consider each agent desires that all selected committee members are close to
them. More precisely, we look at the sum objective, in which the goal is to
minimize the total distance from all agents to all members of the chosen
committee. We show that it is always possible to find a committee which is both
low-cost according to this objective, and also fair according to many existing
notions of fairness and proportionality defined for clustering settings.
Moreover, we introduce a new desirable axiom for representative committees we
call NORP, which prevents over-representation of any subset of agents. While
all existing algorithms for fair committee selection do not satisfy this
intuitive property, we provide new algorithms which form simultaneously
low-cost, fair, and NORP solutions, thus showing that it is always possible to
form low-cost, fair, and representative committees for our settings.

Conclusion: 将统计决策理论与机制设计相联系，利用异质性和策略参与提升假设检验效率。

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic
agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the
population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the
performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how
it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal
tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their
private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the
principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of
the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all
separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an
arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where
information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible
additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving
statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper
scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test
constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the
geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error
trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with
mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation
can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.

Method: 将选民建模为有向加权图节点，研究预算内确保偏好候选人获胜的移位策略，分析问题复杂度，设计不同图结构下的算法。

Result: 证明问题在特定条件下NP完全和W[2]难，给出完全图、路径图、传递锦标赛图、簇图等不同图结构下的算法。

Conclusion: 给出社交网络中移位贿赂问题的详细复杂度图景。

Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying
voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters
act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in
reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a
social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby
amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks,
where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs
represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not
confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the
network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and
individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a
designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists
within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and
network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is
NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when
parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design
polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority
rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for
transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform
arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further
prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as
parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and
pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform
arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for
shift bribery in social networks.

Result: AMID算法在不同拍卖场景下大幅提高了收入，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: AMID算法结合近似界和优化保证，为多智能体激励设计提供了强大且可扩展的算法工具。

Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash
equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many
decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the
exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as
a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an
infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are
Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate
$\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous
setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the
important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in
dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel
approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive
Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated
equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting
approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,
scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction
settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over
first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.

Motivation: 现有差分隐私（DP）未利用数据集先验分布知识，评估相关数据集信息泄漏效果不佳，需更好的隐私度量方法。

Method: 建立点wise最大泄漏（PML）框架，结合玩家成本函数数据集的先验知识，获得隐私泄漏的精确可计算上界；构造特定相关数据集对比PML和DP的上下界；进行实验验证框架有效性。

Result: PML能提供更严格的隐私保证，细化了DP；特定相关数据集下PML下界可超过DP上界；实验证明框架有效。

Conclusion: PML是比DP更合适的隐私度量，DP无法充分捕捉相关数据集的隐私泄漏。

Abstract: Privacy preservation has served as a key metric in designing Nash equilibrium
(NE) computation algorithms. Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely
employed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional
knowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for
correlated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise
maximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By
incorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a
precise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In
the entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy
guarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the
individual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper
bound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets. The results emphasize
that PML is a more proper privacy measure than DP since the latter fails to
adequately capture privacy leakage in correlated datasets. Moreover, we conduct
experiments with adversaries who attempt to infer players' private information
to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: 现有多域序列推荐方法忽视域转换复杂性，存在过拟合和扩展性问题。

Method: 提出GMFlowRec框架，集成统一双掩码Transformer、高斯混合流场和域对齐先验。

Result: 在JD和Amazon数据集上NDCG@5提升达44%，且通过单一统一骨干保持高效。

Conclusion: GMFlowRec可用于现实世界多域序列推荐，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Users increasingly interact with content across multiple domains, resulting
in sequential behaviors marked by frequent and complex transitions. While
Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) models two-domain interactions,
Multi-Domain Sequential Recommendation (MDSR) introduces significantly more
domain transitions, compounded by challenges such as domain heterogeneity and
imbalance. Existing approaches often overlook the intricacies of domain
transitions, tend to overfit to dense domains while underfitting sparse ones,
and struggle to scale effectively as the number of domains increases. We
propose \textit{GMFlowRec}, an efficient generative framework for MDSR that
models domain-aware transition trajectories via Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching.
GMFlowRec integrates: (1) a unified dual-masked Transformer to disentangle
domain-invariant and domain-specific intents, (2) a Gaussian Mixture flow field
to capture diverse behavioral patterns, and (3) a domain-aligned prior to
support frequent and sparse transitions. Extensive experiments on JD and Amazon
datasets demonstrate that GMFlowRec achieves state-of-the-art performance with
up to 44\% improvement in NDCG@5, while maintaining high efficiency via a
single unified backbone, making it scalable for real-world multi-domain
sequential recommendation.

Abstract: This paper discusses the issue regarding Non-verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder.
It has been observed that this mental disorder is listed in major parts of the
world including the US, UK, and India. To mitigate this type of disorder, a
wide range of smartphones, computers, and artificial intelligence technologies
have been used. This technology has helped the population cope with
socialization and communication needs. Many applications have been developed to
enhance the communication capabilities of non-verbal autistic children. This
thesis project proposes the development of a platform that includes a web panel
and an Android mobile application to assist non-verbal autistic children in
communication, especially in Oman. Different interventions have been merged to
improve the quality of life for people on the autism spectrum. The main problem
identified in this case is that fragmented approaches are not suitable for
autistic children. The augmented reality framework provides the capability to
engage autistic children in creative play and self-reflection through
interactive screen-based activities.

Result: 分析揭示视觉对话独特动态，基准测试显示现有模型存在分布错误和泛化能力问题。

Conclusion: VOGUE是研究多模态对话系统的独特资源，也是现有模型难以应对的挑战数据集。

Abstract: Multimodal conversational recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
for delivering personalized experiences through natural dialogue enriched by
visual and contextual grounding. Yet, current multimodal conversational
recommendation datasets remain limited: existing resources either simulate
conversations, omit user history, or fail to collect sufficiently detailed
feedback, all of which constrain the types of research and evaluation they
support.
  To address these gaps, we introduce VOGUE, a novel dataset of 60 humanhuman
dialogues in realistic fashion shopping scenarios. Each dialogue is paired with
a shared visual catalogue, item metadata, user fashion profiles and histories,
and post-conversation ratings from both Seekers and Assistants. This design
enables rigorous evaluation of conversational inference, including not only
alignment between predicted and ground-truth preferences, but also calibration
against full rating distributions and comparison with explicit and implicit
user satisfaction signals.
  Our initial analyses of VOGUE reveal distinctive dynamics of visually
grounded dialogue. For example, recommenders frequently suggest items
simultaneously in feature-based groups, which creates distinct conversational
phases bridged by Seeker critiques and refinements. Benchmarking multimodal
large language models against human recommenders shows that while MLLMs
approach human-level alignment in aggregate, they exhibit systematic
distribution errors in reproducing human ratings and struggle to generalize
preference inference beyond explicitly discussed items. These findings
establish VOGUE as both a unique resource for studying multimodal
conversational systems and as a challenge dataset beyond the current
recommendation capabilities of existing top-tier multimodal foundation models
such as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash.

Method: 提出BLOGER框架，在统一优化过程中显式建模分词器和推荐器的相互依赖，采用元学习方法解决双层优化问题，并引入梯度手术缓解梯度冲突。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，BLOGER始终优于现有生成式推荐方法，且无显著额外计算开销。

Conclusion: BLOGER有效弥合了项目分词和自回归生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a transformative paradigm by
directly generating recommended items, rather than relying on matching.
Building such a system typically involves two key components: (1) optimizing
the tokenizer to derive suitable item identifiers, and (2) training the
recommender based on those identifiers. Existing approaches often treat these
components separately--either sequentially or in alternation--overlooking their
interdependence. This separation can lead to misalignment: the tokenizer is
trained without direct guidance from the recommendation objective, potentially
yielding suboptimal identifiers that degrade recommendation performance.
  To address this, we propose BLOGER, a Bi-Level Optimization for GEnerative
Recommendation framework, which explicitly models the interdependence between
the tokenizer and the recommender in a unified optimization process. The lower
level trains the recommender using tokenized sequences, while the upper level
optimizes the tokenizer based on both the tokenization loss and recommendation
loss. We adopt a meta-learning approach to solve this bi-level optimization
efficiently, and introduce gradient surgery to mitigate gradient conflicts in
the upper-level updates, thereby ensuring that item identifiers are both
informative and recommendation-aligned. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BLOGER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
generative recommendation methods while maintaining practical efficiency with
no significant additional computational overhead, effectively bridging the gap
between item tokenization and autoregressive generation.

Method: 提出个性化上下文感知分词器，在生成语义ID时结合用户历史交互，使同一物品在不同用户上下文中被标记为不同语义ID。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，相比非个性化的动作分词基线，NDCG@10最多提高11.44%。

Conclusion: 所提出的个性化上下文感知分词器能让GR模型捕捉多种解读标准，产生更个性化的预测。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: CausalRec是首个在序列推荐中通过注意力机制引入因果关系的模型，证明因果关系对生成更准确可靠推荐的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have
demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model
outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both
short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on
item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,
leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal
attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal
discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the
causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee
the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the
discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing
behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world
datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,
with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in
sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating
more accurate and reliable recommendations.

Abstract: The use of natural language (NL) user profiles in recommender systems offers
greater transparency and user control compared to traditional representations.
However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections
for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we
introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that
leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and
corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison
of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to
state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline
methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items,
indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for
improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based
recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable
resource for fostering future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions
through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems
remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast
knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands
sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,
and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and
adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing
systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges
this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that
preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular
representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval
architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with
dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that
decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize
comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous
evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,
Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158
expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,
M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.
Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter
than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research
requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that
preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document
collections.

Conclusion: 系统的数据工程与复杂的模型修改同样有效，且更具可部署性，为现实电商场景构建健壮的多语言搜索系统提供了可行指导。

Abstract: Multilingual e-commerce search suffers from severe data imbalance across
languages, label noise, and limited supervision for low-resource
languages--challenges that impede the cross-lingual generalization of relevance
models despite the strong capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we present a practical, architecture-agnostic, data-centric framework to
enhance performance on two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance (matching
queries to product categories) and Query-Item (QI) relevance (matching queries
to product titles). Rather than altering the model, we redesign the training
data through three complementary strategies: (1) translation-based augmentation
to synthesize examples for languages absent in training, (2) semantic negative
sampling to generate hard negatives and mitigate class imbalance, and (3)
self-validation filtering to detect and remove likely mislabeled instances.
Evaluated on the CIKM AnalytiCup 2025 dataset, our approach consistently yields
substantial F1 score improvements over strong LLM baselines, achieving
competitive results in the official competition. Our findings demonstrate that
systematic data engineering can be as impactful as--and often more deployable
than--complex model modifications, offering actionable guidance for building
robust multilingual search systems in the real-world e-commerce settings.

TL;DR: 论文指出音频大语言模型推理存在测试时逆缩放现象，提出CESAR框架解决该问题，取得了SOTA结果并提升了推理和感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型推理作用未充分探索，推理过程常导致推理性能下降，即测试时逆缩放现象。

Method: 引入CESAR框架，采用在线强化学习，运用Group Relative Policy Optimization和多方面奖励机制。

Result: 在MMAU Test - mini上取得SOTA结果，大幅超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT - 4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平。

Conclusion: CESAR为音频大语言模型开发强大且可扩展的推理能力建立了原则性方法。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经网络的框架用于小房贷债券市场稳健收益率曲线估计，实证显示比现有方法更优，还能集成特定约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统收益率曲线估计方法在数据稀疏、价格波动或有噪声时存在过拟合或不稳定问题，需要新方法。

Method: 提出基于神经网络的框架，独立估计每日收益率曲线，引入新损失函数确保平滑性和稳定性。

Result: 在瑞典房贷债券上的实证表明，该方法比Nelson - Siegel - Svensson和Kernel - Ridge等现有方法有更稳健和稳定的收益率曲线估计。

Conclusion: 该框架能解决有限和有噪声数据的挑战，还可集成特定约束，让从业者按需平衡平滑性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Motivation: 现有基于图的时空学习方法在市场动态因不同危机机制转变时，难以适应，无法准确预测最优资产配置。

Method: 提出CRISP框架，通过图卷积网络编码空间关系，用带自注意力的BiLSTM编码时间动态，再通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构。

Result: 在2005 - 2021年数据上训练，对2022 - 2024年通胀驱动市场有良好泛化能力，夏普比率达3.76，比等权重基线提升707%，比静态图方法提升94%。

Conclusion: CRISP框架能有效应对不同危机机制下的市场动态变化，实现自适应资产配置，且学习到的注意力权重可用于可解释的制度检测。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Result: 在四个移动平台综合评估，线性层最高达1.89倍加速，卷积层达1.75倍加速。

Conclusion: 所提方法能快速选择CPU - GPU协同执行策略，接近通过穷举网格搜索得到的最大加速值。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Conclusion: MOBO - OSD算法在多目标优化中有效，能提升解的多样性和超体积性能，加速优化过程。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/BaoquanGong/Multimodal-Negative-Learning.git.

Result: 与TurboRAG相比，HA - RAG在TTFT上平均加速2.10倍，最大加速10.49倍，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: HA - RAG能有效提升RAG推理速度，同时保证精度。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: 通过特定处理的重尾SGD能避免尖锐极小值，实现更好的测试数据泛化性能。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

Motivation: 无模型强化学习缺乏正式安全保证，现有提供保证的方法依赖安全规范的详细知识。

Method: 利用可逆性防止安全问题，用模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，仅需查询黑盒动态。

Result: 提出的算法能在所有不安全动作前成功中止，训练进度与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决无模型强化学习中的安全问题，且无需明确的动态或安全约束知识。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

*Yongqiang Chen,Gang Niu,James Cheng,Bo Han,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 文章提出新的协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD用于大语言模型错误检测，相比之前协议有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论协议将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论作弊问题，影响错误检测效果，需要改进。

Method: 引入新的协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD，将辩论重构为非零和博弈，鼓励智能体相互支持性批评。

Result: ColMAD在错误检测上比之前的竞争性多智能体辩论协议显著高出19%，相比单智能体方法也有重要改进。

Conclusion: ColMAD能有效提升大语言模型错误检测的效果。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

Conclusion: 三个开源库在MIT许可下发布，在GitHub上积极维护。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central

and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and
Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level
recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and
LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and
extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and

Motivation: 现有互信息估计器要么依赖需要大量数据的高灵活性模型，要么依赖无法捕捉复杂分布的简化模型，需要在复杂度和容量间取得更好平衡。

Result: 在最先进的合成基准和多模态真实数据上的实验证明了所提估计器的优势。

Conclusion: 所提的互信息估计方法能在复杂度和容量间取得较好平衡，具有优势。

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

Result: 发现学习率较小时处于“信息指数机制”，较大时处于“生成指数机制”的相转变。

Conclusion: 学习率的选择在实现统计和计算效率方面与算法设计同样重要。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized

Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs在特定领域应用的准确性尚不明确，需评估其在压缩血流动力学场和表示心血管解剖结构的性能。

Method: 评估现有INRs性能，采用专门激活函数、位置编码和非线性核线性组合等策略缓解频谱偏差。

Result: 在胸主动脉血流动力学场实现约230的压缩比，压力和速度误差小；48个胸主动脉解剖结构的误差也较小，SIREN、MFN - Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: INRs在压缩血流动力学场和表示心血管解剖结构方面有良好表现，部分架构性能突出。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Result: 能实现高质量帕累托集近似，避免显式超体积计算，有效结合用户偏好，在合成基准和蛋白质设计任务中样本效率高。

Conclusion: A - GPS是简单且强大的方法，在多目标优化中有良好表现。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Motivation: 大语言模型在科学发现上突破有限，MOF设计依赖人类专业知识，需新方法突破障碍。

Method: 引入L2M3OF，集成晶体表征学习和语言理解，用预训练晶体编码器和轻量级投影层处理多模态信息，构建数据库并进行基准测试。

Result: L2M3OF在属性预测和知识生成任务上超越领先文本模型，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 强调多模态方法对多孔材料理解的重要性，L2M3OF可作为下一代材料发现AI系统基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Result: 在大量任务和架构上评估，MeDyate在极端内存约束下达到了最先进性能，持续超越现有静态和动态方法，保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法是实现高效设备端学习的重要一步，能在几百kB内存预算下有效微调。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Motivation: 标准强化学习优化平均奖励，专注减少不良输出概率的方法会牺牲平均性能，需改善权衡。

Method: 在标准强化学习损失基础上增加额外损失，用学习的提议引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励和不良输出概率间有更好权衡，且对抗鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: RePULSe比标准强化学习对齐方法和其他替代方法更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法比现有后训练量化基线在模型大小和准确率间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架在严格资源约束下部署大模型有效，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Conclusion: 该新概率框架结合深度学习的表达能力和概率建模的严谨性，且与架构无关，效果良好。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Result: 在放射性源检测中，少量神经元和突触的SNNs优于PCA和深度学习基线，集成模型提高真阳性率；硬件部署功耗低、推理延迟短。在癫痫检测中，集成模型表现与深度学习相当且参数减少。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效，具有良好性能、可部署性和泛化性。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数。

Result: 在图像分类、文本分类和偏好对齐任务上验证了RAVEN的有效性，在分布外任务上比替代基线高出30%以上，在分布内任务上与现有方法相当或更优，能自动识别可信赖的监督。

Conclusion: RAVEN是一个有效的鲁棒弱到强泛化框架，能够应对分布偏移问题。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像自回归模型生成速度慢，Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) 有性能下降和依赖预定义映射问题，需改进一步采样可行性。

Method: 将原AR模型作为教师模型，提出条件分数蒸馏损失训练一步生成器，训练独立网络预测生成分布条件分数并在每个标记位置应用分数蒸馏。

Result: DD2实现图像AR模型一步采样，在ImageNet - 256上FID从3.40增至5.43，相比DD1减少一步采样与原AR模型差距67%，训练加速达12.3倍。

Conclusion: DD2向一步AR生成目标迈进，为快速高质量AR建模带来新可能。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Conclusion: FRG框架在实现高置信度公平的表征学习方面是有效的。

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: ZO优化能增强稳定性但削弱可塑性，ZO - FC可有效平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Conclusion: ZO - FC是实用且内存高效的设备端CL解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效量化生成流网络学习策略在奖励不确定时的不确定性。

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Conclusion: 所提出的两阶段框架为准确、基于物理且考虑不确定性的时空预测提供了稳健且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Conclusion: PABM能捕捉到DCBM忽略的度异质性维度，含k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法更适合PABM。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made

Conclusion: 最短答案启发式方法比自一致性有帕累托改进，甚至适用于输出相等性定义不明确的任务。

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Result: 证明该梯度流会出现NC现象，放松无约束特征假设，揭示训练动态隐式偏差作用。

Conclusion: 推进了先前关于NC现象的理论成果。

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

Conclusion: 整合全局基序知识和细粒度局部上下文能有效推动鲁棒的少样本分子属性预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布评估中，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能有效解决POMDP中复杂信念分布的表示问题，提升决策质量。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Conclusion: 所提方法能平衡不同群体下游预测的整体性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Conclusion: SolarBoost方法能有效解决分布式光伏系统功率输出预测问题，为电网运行提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Result: 实验结果验证了该方法，工作流复杂度增加时性能优于基线。

Conclusion: 该框架能学习有效长期策略，适用于复杂大规模MIoT调度场景。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online

TL;DR: 研究聚焦表格基础模型先验设计，提出Mitra模型，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格基础模型先验设计指导原则不明，需填补这一空白。

Method: 系统研究合成先验的关键属性，基于此引入在合成先验混合数据集上训练的Mitra模型。

Result: Mitra在分类和回归基准测试中始终优于TabPFNv2和TabICL等模型，样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 确定合成先验关键属性，Mitra模型有效提升表格基础模型性能。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Motivation: 解决图神经网络固定消息传递架构难以适应现实图多样性的问题，且现有图MoE方法依赖监督信号和训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干 - 残差专家架构，用结构感知门控网络进行节点路由，通过统一无监督目标进行端到端训练。

Conclusion: ADaMoRE在不同图和任务上具有优越的泛化性、训练效率和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Method: 提出约束每个流步骤从已知物理分布采样的通用框架，通过2D Ising模型实现，架构包括编码器、流匹配网络和投影器。

Result: 在多个晶格大小上验证框架，保持物理保真度，随着晶格大小增加速度优于蒙特卡罗生成，每个向量场代表2D Ising模型潜空间中有意义的逐步过渡。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Result: 综合实验证明了FDAs在模型合并中的有效性。

Conclusion: FDAs框架为模型合并提供了新视角，兼具鲁棒性和灵活性，且与参数空间模型合并互补。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Result: 可实现的混淆程度与近似模型的不确定性相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果可为基于深度模型的强化学习提供理论上合理的探索策略。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

Result: Wideformer能有效缓解过聚合，骨干方法能关注关键信息。

Conclusion: Wideformer作为即插即用方法，相比基线方法能取得更优性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Result: 新方法在缓解领域偏移、增强模型鲁棒性上优于传统方法，对遗忘有强恢复力，且能集成到现有TTA框架提升性能。

Conclusion: 该解决方案在现实领域适应场景中有效且通用。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Conclusion: 测试匹配增强与基于变压器的集成是噪声条件下鲁棒人体活动识别的有效策略。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: DVC是首个对神经网络分层数据评估的系统处理方法，有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Conclusion: 为GAMs计算多样解释的可行性提供了严谨的理论图景，明确了计算可行或困难的条件。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Conclusion: 所提算法在多臂老虎机公平性度量上优于先前工作，能在更广泛条件下实现良好效果。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Conclusion: 该方法对已投入资源训练模型且需清理后共享的医院等行业有用。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Motivation: 传统采样方法有收敛慢等问题，基于似然和对抗的机器学习模型依赖大数据且有模式覆盖和崩溃问题。

Method: 提出基于归一化流架构的ScoreNF框架，集成独立Metropolis - Hastings模块，还有评估模式覆盖和崩溃行为的方法。

Result: ScoreNF在小训练集下保持高性能，在合成二维分布和高维格点场论分布验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: ScoreNF能有效解决从不归一化分布采样问题，减少对训练数据依赖。

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

TL;DR: 提出C - MCTD框架解决MCTD在长规划中的局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD受训练轨迹长度限制，规划过程局部受限，缺乏全局上下文

Method: 提出C - MCTD框架，包含Online Composer、Distributed Composer和Preplan Composer三个组件

Result: 未提及

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Conclusion: 提出的OTCIL框架（- kF - Bayes和 - kF风格）有效。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，可在不修改目标和架构下实现多种解纠缠，代码开源。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Conclusion: 自扩散方法灵活且广泛适用，无需预训练分数函数或外部去噪器，能适应任意前向算子和噪声观测。

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决反Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖、训练效率和预测精度不足的问题。

Method: 用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过优化由初始和边界条件及控制偏微分方程组成的物理定律损失向量确定输出权重，用最小二乘法将求解反Stefan问题转化为求Moore - Penrose广义逆。

Result: 案例研究表明，与传统PINNs相比，PIELM在相对L2误差方面可将预测精度提高3 - 7个数量级，同时节省超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM是一种有效的解决反Stefan问题的快速物理信息学习方法框架。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Conclusion: GSAC框架在解决大规模网络系统强化学习的规模和环境变化挑战方面有效，具有良好的可扩展性和领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

Method: 提出UTR将回报、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，开发基于Transformer和门控CNN骨干的UDT和UDC两种变体。

Result: 理论分析表明UTR有更紧的拉德马赫复杂度界，UDT和UDC与现有方法性能相当或更优，计算量显著降低。

Conclusion: UTR跨架构泛化性好，可为未来大型决策模型的可扩展控制提供有效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

Conclusion: ParaRNN框架有效打破非线性RNN序列并行化障碍，代码开源利于高效序列建模研究。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

TL;DR: 现有因果机器学习方法在网络环境估计异质治疗效果时存在不足，本文提出HINet方法并通过实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法假设已知暴露映射不现实，且同质性与治疗分配机制相互作用导致的网络级协变量偏移现象未被明确研究，需解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出HINet方法，将图神经网络与领域对抗训练相结合。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet方法能在未知暴露映射下估计治疗效果，减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图神经网络存在过拟合和可扩展性问题，需要模型在捕捉高阶结构时从稀缺标签泛化。

Method: 基于线性化超图神经网络统一公式，引入权重矩阵的闭式解和冗余感知传播方案。

Result: 在11个真实超图基准上，ZEN分类准确率始终优于8个基线模型，速度比最快竞争对手提升达696倍。

Conclusion: ZEN能兼顾表达性和效率，决策过程可解释，为数据集特征提供见解。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Motivation: 先前工作聚焦于使用经验均值估计器的一致收敛，本文旨在拓展框架，研究任意估计器下分布族均值的一致估计条件。

Method: 在分布族的均值向量构成的空间上进行研究，通过构造反例等方法进行分析。

Result: 证明均值向量可分是UME可学习的充分条件，构造反例说明可分非必要，证明UME可学习族的可数并也是UME可学习的。

Conclusion: 解决了Cohen等人（2025）提出的猜想，为分布族均值的一致估计提供了新的理论结果。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

TL;DR: 提出统一模型UM解决八种灾后道路评估（PDRA）无人机路由变体问题，实验表明其在训练时间、参数、解质量等方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法和现有深度强化学习方法在大规模网络无人机路由方面存在扩展性差、缺乏适应性等问题，需要新方法解决PDRA问题。

Method: 提出统一模型UM，通过在多问题配置上训练单个神经网络，采用现代变压器编解码器架构，结合轻量级适配器机制。

Result: UM相比单独训练模型减少八倍训练时间和参数，解质量比单任务DRL方法高6 - 14%，比传统优化方法高24 - 82%，能在1 - 10秒内处理1000节点网络，微调实验表现良好。

Conclusion: UM推进了时间关键应用的神经组合优化，为基于无人机的PDRA提供高效、优质、可适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

TL;DR: 本文探讨基于探针训练模型以减少不良行为，提出两种训练方法，发现基于探针的偏好优化能更好保留可检测性，重训练探针可恢复高检测准确率，探针集成在重训练可行时并非必要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练针对可解释性工具的模型时存在监测器不可靠问题（Goodhart's Law），需探索有效训练方法。

Method: 基于监督微调（Supervised Fine - tuning）和直接偏好优化（Direct Preference Optimization）提出两种训练方法，在减少毒性的测试平台进行探索，尝试使用探针集成、保留未训练探针、训练后重训练新探针等方法。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化比基于分类器的方法更好地保留了探针可检测性；探针多样性实际益处不大，优化后重训练探针可恢复高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练对某些对齐方法可行，当重训练可行时，探针集成大多不必要。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出时空区域失真（SRD）伪异常生成方法，降低标签噪声实现有效对抗训练，提升弱监督视频异常检测模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测（WSVAD）模型易受对抗攻击且传统防御机制因弱监督限制无效，伪标签有噪声影响性能。

Method: 引入时空区域失真（SRD）方法，对正常视频局部区域进行增强生成合成异常，将其与噪声伪标签结合进行对抗训练。

Result: 方法显著增强WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，在多个基准测试中整体AUROC性能平均比现有方法高71.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的SRD方法能有效降低标签噪声，提升WSVAD模型在对抗攻击下的性能。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Motivation: 统一机器学习评估问题，解决流行成对度量方法在评估文档修订相似度时的缺陷。

Method: 提出修订相似度的五个充分性标准，提出Excision Score (ES)，通过计算最长公共子序列去除共享内容，使用近似方法加快计算。

Result: 在代码编辑评估中，ES在相关性上优于SARI 12%，优于标准度量超21%；增加共享上下文时，优势更明显，还能处理其他度量无法处理的特殊情况。

Conclusion: ES在评估文档修订相似度上表现更优，能更好地符合人类判断。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Conclusion: MADDPG - COCG算法能有效解决SAGIN - MEC在低空经济中面临的挑战，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入GNN能提供有用归纳偏置，提升复杂真实世界图数据的性能。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Conclusion: 通过相关研究加深了对深度神经网络创建表征和泛化机制的理解。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Conclusion: 发布代码、预训练权重和教程，支持标准化EEG研究，加速临床神经科学发展。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动深度学习方法求解非线性时偏微分方程需大量解对，传统数值方法生成解对计算和时间开销大。

Method: 提出HOPSS算法，先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数并降采样，再用“同源扰动”方法结合随机噪声生成数据点，计算原方程RHS变化形成新解对。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能有效加速数据集生成，同时保持模型训练所需的近似精度。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Method: 引入通用框架计算TNs的精确SHAP解释，利用并行计算处理特定结构，借助二值化神经网络到TNs的转换。

Result: TNs在特定结构下SHAP计算可在多对数时间完成，结果可推广到其他模型，宽度固定时SHAP计算可高效处理。

Conclusion: 对于此类模型，宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Conclusion: GFM在特定设计下统一并提升现有欧几里得少步生成模型到黎曼设置，表现优异。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法无法保留数据的成对和高阶相关结构，用于复杂建模任务时会失败，因此需要新方法。

Method: 使用目标相关矩阵的Cholesky分解来生成数据集。

Result: 通过数学证明，该方法生成的数据集能保留源数据集从简单成对关系到高阶交互的完整相关结构。

Conclusion: 此方法为合成数据生成提供了新途径，在隐私保护数据共享、稳健模型训练和模拟等方面有潜在应用。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Motivation: 在安全关键场景中部署强化学习受分布偏移下的脆弱性限制，需要进行OOD检测。

Method: 提出DEEDEE，仅使用逐集均值和RBF核相似度，捕捉全局和局部偏差。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD套件中表现与当代检测器相当或更优，计算量减少600倍，比强基线平均绝对准确率提高5%。

Conclusion: 多样的异常类型常通过少量低阶统计量印刻在RL轨迹上，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

Conclusion: 建立了等变性与不确定性估计的理论联系，揭示了对称性不匹配对校准的影响，为数据稀疏场景下的深度学习提供参考。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Conclusion: 首次给出神经TSP求解器在节点选择前计算内容的模型内部解释，表明几何结构可无监督出现，并为构建透明混合系统提供途径。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Motivation: 探究果蝇嗅觉回路中LI和SFA在气味学习过程中是起冗余还是不同作用。

Method: 建立果蝇嗅觉回路的计算模型，研究不同噪声条件下的气味辨别。

Result: LI在低、中噪声场景增强气味辨别，高噪声下效果减弱甚至反转；SFA在各噪声水平都能改善辨别；二者结合实现最优辨别性能。

Conclusion: 生物回路中看似冗余的模块对复杂环境下的最优学习至关重要。

Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform
similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI)
and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern
separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these
mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we
present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor
discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex
environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination
in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse
under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves
discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low-
and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.
When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal
discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant
modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal
learning in complex contexts.

Motivation: SNNs在视觉长序列建模任务中难以取得有竞争力的性能，需要提升其视觉特征建模能力。

Method: 引入Spatio - Temporal Effective Receptive Field (ST - ERF)分析Transformer - 基SNNs，提出MLPixer和SRB两种通道混合器架构。

Result: 在Meta - SDT变体以及目标检测和语义分割任务上的大量实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ST - ERF框架可为更广泛任务的SNN架构设计和优化提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) demonstrate significant potential for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing through an event-driven paradigm. While
training methods and computational models have greatly advanced, SNNs struggle
to achieve competitive performance in visual long-sequence modeling tasks. In
artificial neural networks, the effective receptive field (ERF) serves as a
valuable tool for analyzing feature extraction capabilities in visual
long-sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal
Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF) to analyze the ERF distributions across
various Transformer-based SNNs. Based on the proposed ST-ERF, we reveal that
these models suffer from establishing a robust global ST-ERF, thereby limiting
their visual feature modeling capabilities. To overcome this issue, we propose
two novel channel-mixer architectures:
\underline{m}ulti-\underline{l}ayer-\underline{p}erceptron-based
m\underline{ixer} (MLPixer) and \underline{s}plash-and-\underline{r}econstruct
\underline{b}lock (SRB). These architectures enhance global spatial ERF through
all timesteps in early network stages of Transformer-based SNNs, improving
performance on challenging visual long-sequence modeling tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on the Meta-SDT variants and across object detection and
semantic segmentation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. Beyond these specific applications, we believe the proposed ST-ERF
framework can provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing SNN
architectures across a broader range of tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出REvolution框架结合进化计算与大语言模型进行RTL自动生成与优化，实验显示其提升了LLM初始通过率并改善PPA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型用于RTL代码生成时面临功能正确性和PPA优化挑战，现有迭代反馈方法局限于局部搜索。

Method: 提出REvolution框架，并行进化候选集，采用双种群算法分组处理，还有自适应机制调整提示策略选择概率。

Result: 在基准测试中，REvolution使多种LLM初始通过率最多提升24.0个百分点，DeepSeek - V3最终通过率达95.5%，生成的RTL设计PPA显著改善。

Conclusion: 结合LLM生成能力与EC搜索能力的新RTL设计方法克服了以往局部搜索的局限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code
generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and
Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based
methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,
hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,
a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic
RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates
in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and
evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that
divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA
optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search
efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt
strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and
RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of
various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a
final pass rate of 95.5\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the
need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the
generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference
designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs'
generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the
local-search limitations of previous methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的多目标GA用于实时DEX路由具有端到端安全性，当前未发现公开记录的类似方案。

Abstract: CoW Protocol batch auctions aggregate user intents and rely on solvers to
find optimal execution paths that maximize user surplus across heterogeneous
automated market makers (AMMs) under stringent auction deadlines. Deterministic
single-objective heuristics that optimize only expected output frequently fail
to exploit split-flow opportunities across multiple parallel paths and to
internalize gas, slippage, and execution risk constraints in a unified search.
We apply evolutionary multi-objective optimization to this blockchain routing
problem, proposing a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) architecture for real-time
solver optimization that combines a production-grade, multi-objective NSGA-II
engine with adaptive instance profiling and deterministic baselines. Our core
engine encodes variable-length path sets with continuous split ratios and
evolves candidate route-and-volume allocations under a Pareto objective vector
F = (user surplus, -gas, -slippage, -risk), enabling principled trade-offs and
anytime operation within the auction deadline. An adaptive controller selects
between GA and a deterministic dual-decomposition optimizer with Bellman-Ford
based negative-cycle detection, with a guarantee to never underperform the
baseline. The open-source system integrates six protection layers and passes
8/8 tests, validating safety and correctness. In a 14-stratum benchmark (30
seeds each), the hybrid approach yields absolute user-surplus gains of
approximately 0.40-9.82 ETH on small-to-medium orders, while large
high-fragmentation orders are unprofitable across gas regimes. Convergence
occurs in about 0.5 s median (soft capped at 1.0 s) within a 2-second limit. We
are not aware of an openly documented multi-objective GA with end-to-end safety
for real-time DEX routing.

Motivation: 解决全球GPU稀缺下，共享集群环境中深度学习任务调度问题，现有估计方法存在无法捕捉运行时动态、消耗资源、需代码修改等局限。

Method: 提出xMem框架，利用仅CPU动态分析提前准确估计GPU峰值内存需求。

Result: 对25种不同模型的工作负载进行评估，分析5209次运行，xMem使中位相对误差降低91%，估计失败概率降低75%，内存节约潜力提升368%。

Conclusion: xMem能有效改善GPU内存需求估计，减少误差和失败概率，提升内存节约潜力。

Abstract: The global scarcity of GPUs necessitates more sophisticated strategies for
Deep Learning jobs in shared cluster environments. Accurate estimation of how
much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced
scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and
resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have
limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with
machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics.
Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques
require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely
estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances,
without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this
challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic
analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We
conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions
using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs,
which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it
decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the
probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that
the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately,
these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential
over current solutions.

Conclusion: AgentArcEval 和通用场景目录能有效应对基于基础模型的智能体架构评估复杂性。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of
highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities
across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is
particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the
quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including
compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and
continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in
addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique
characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present
AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially
to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.
Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which
serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the
agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the
catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world
tax copilot, named Luna.

Conclusion: BDiff算法有效，实现了基于Web的可视化差分工具。

Abstract: Code differencing is a fundamental technique in software engineering practice
and research. While researchers have proposed text-based differencing
techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing
methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that
operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in
developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or
duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent
such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling
developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the
efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a
text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of
block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional
differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all
possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size
of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's
intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five
state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines
and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their
performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental
results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than
baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our
experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks
regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime
efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool.

Result: 在三个数据集上用五个大语言模型评估R2ComSync，与五个SOTA方法对比，实验显示其性能更优。

Conclusion: R2ComSync能有效解决代码注释同步问题，同步的注释质量显著更高。

Abstract: Code-Comment Synchronization (CCS) aims to synchronize the comments with code
changes in an automated fashion, thereby significantly reducing the workload of
developers during software maintenance and evolution. While previous studies
have proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit
limitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive
task-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot
analysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches
because (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL)
and (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above
challenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization
approach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync
carries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally
considers the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns
when retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2)
Multi-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through
large-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it
progressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively
correct-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three
CCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make
comparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both
quantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the
comments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}

Motivation: 自动配置内存分配器，以优化其性能。

Method: 使用NSGA II和rand_malloc作为轻量级代理基准工具，从执行跟踪中探索分配器参数并转移到gem5模拟器。

Result: 在不同工作负载下，平均堆使用最多减少4.1%，实际减少0.25%，且不损失运行时效率。

Abstract: We present GreenMalloc, a multi objective search-based framework for
automatically configuring memory allocators. Our approach uses NSGA II and
rand_malloc as a lightweight proxy benchmarking tool. We efficiently explore
allocator parameters from execution traces and transfer the best configurations
to gem5, a large system simulator, in a case study on two allocators: the GNU
C/CPP compiler's glibc malloc and Google's TCMalloc. Across diverse workloads,
our empirical results show up to 4.1 percantage reduction in average heap usage
without loss of runtime efficiency; indeed, we get a 0.25 percantage reduction.

Result: 尚无既定结构，上下文提供方式多样；分析修改AGENTS.md文件的提交记录有初步见解。

Conclusion: AI配置文件的采用为研究实际提示和上下文工程提供了独特机会。

Abstract: GenAI-based coding assistants have disrupted software development. Their next
generation is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without
human oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context
about the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require
contextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target
architecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows,
and other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development
(e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled
Markdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and
testing, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to
each prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates
tool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how
developers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results
of a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in
466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these
files, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our
findings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is
a lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive,
prescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in
studying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect
the quality of the generated content. Finally, our analysis of commits that
have modified AGENTS.md files provides first insights into how projects
continuously extend and maintain these files. We conclude the paper by
outlining how the adoption of AI configuration files in provides a unique
opportunity to study real-world prompt and context engineering.

TL;DR: 研究对比大语言模型（LLMs）和小语言模型（SLMs）在需求分类任务中的表现，发现SLMs是LLMs的有效替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需求工程的自然语言处理任务中有显著成果，但存在高计算成本、数据共享风险和依赖外部服务等问题，而SLMs是轻量级、可本地部署的替代方案，目前不清楚SLMs在需求工程任务中与LLMs的准确性对比情况。

Method: 在PROMISE、PROMISE Reclass和SecReq数据集上对三个LLMs和五个SLMs共八个模型进行需求分类任务对比。

Result: LLMs平均F1分数比SLMs高2%，但差异无统计学意义；SLMs在所有数据集上接近LLMs的性能，在PROMISE Reclass数据集的召回率上甚至超过LLMs，且模型大小最多小300倍；数据集特征对性能的影响比模型大小更显著。

Conclusion: SLMs是需求分类中LLMs的有效替代方案，在隐私、成本和本地部署方面具有优势。

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习框架测试方法无法检测汽车深度学习框架因复杂部署环境产生的质量问题，需新的测试方法。

Method: 提出Scalpel方法，维护和更新模型组件库，通过选择、变异和组装组件生成测试输入模型，再用差异测试在自动驾驶系统中测试框架。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) plays a key role in autonomous driving systems. DL models
support perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and
sensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs
to understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving
systems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited
computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these
challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to
optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique
quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as
crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.
Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these
quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as
these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor
processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature
extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which
existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates
test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by
assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities
required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and
updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting,
mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to
enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the
autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential
testing.

Motivation: 软件供应链攻击增多，现有威胁检测缺乏基于社会技术动态的方法，因此提出利用社会技术模型进行自适应威胁检测。

Method: 分析XZ Utils攻击案例，研究监测技术和社会数据识别可疑行为。

Result: 发现监测技术和社会数据可识别指示可疑行为的趋势，为针对性和深入的漏洞评估提供信息。

Conclusion: 提出利用社会技术模型支持软件供应链自适应威胁检测的愿景，并确定实现该愿景面临的挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Software supply chains (SSCs) are complex systems composed of dynamic,
heterogeneous technical and social components which collectively achieve the
production and maintenance of software artefacts. Attacks on SSCs are
increasing, yet pervasive vulnerability analysis is challenging due to their
complexity. Therefore, threat detection must be targeted, to account for the
large and dynamic structure, and adaptive, to account for its change and
diversity. While current work focuses on technical approaches for monitoring
supply chain dependencies and establishing component controls, approaches which
inform threat detection through understanding the socio-technical dynamics are
lacking. We outline a position and research vision to develop and investigate
the use of socio-technical models to support adaptive threat detection of SSCs.
We motivate this approach through an analysis of the XZ Utils attack whereby
malicious actors undermined the maintainers' trust via the project's GitHub and
mailing lists. We highlight that monitoring technical and social data can
identify trends which indicate suspicious behaviour to then inform targeted and
intensive vulnerability assessment. We identify challenges and research
directions to achieve this vision considering techniques for developer and
software analysis, decentralised adaptation and the need for a test bed for
software supply chain security research.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型基准因各种失败模式可能不可靠，需评估基准风险。

Method: 以美国国家标准与技术研究院的风险管理流程为基础，迭代分析26个流行基准。

Result: 识别57种潜在失败模式和196种缓解策略，提出BenchRisk基准，26个基准在五个维度有显著风险。

Conclusion: BenchRisk可对比基准，作为开源工具便于识别和分享风险及缓解策略，指出大语言模型基准领域重要研究方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) benchmarks inform LLM use decisions (e.g., "is
this LLM safe to deploy for my use case and context?"). However, benchmarks may
be rendered unreliable by various failure modes that impact benchmark bias,
variance, coverage, or people's capacity to understand benchmark evidence.
Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management
process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular
benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding
mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or
severity, providing a frame for evaluating "benchmark risk," which is scored to
provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that
benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion
about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or
more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility,
consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open
research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking. The BenchRisk workflow
allows for comparison between benchmarks; as an open-source tool, it also
facilitates the identification and sharing of risks and their mitigations.

Motivation: 当前单一大型语言模型用于软件工程任务资源消耗大且忽略互补优势，不清楚编码大语言模型间互补程度及最大化集成潜力的策略。

Method: 对来自五个家族的十个单个大语言模型和三个模型集成在三个软件工程基准上进行实证比较，评估模型间互补性、最佳单个模型与集成的性能差距，评估各种选择启发式方法。

Result: 集成性能理论上限比最佳单个模型高83%；基于共识的解决方案选择策略会陷入‘流行陷阱’；基于多样性的策略可实现理论潜力的95%，在小型双模型集成中也有效。

Conclusion: 利用多个大语言模型，基于多样性的策略是一种经济高效的提升性能的方法。

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

Motivation: 实现卫星通信任务地面段的自动化操作，为用户提供更灵活服务，减少人力依赖。

Method: 采用主要自动化概念进行卫星平台操作，包括跟踪、遥测和指令；预规划并自动执行调度；自动监测系统并按需触发反应；设置自助用户门户。

Result: 该方案首次应用于Heinrich Hertz卫星，可实现非办公时间全自动操作，用户能通过门户灵活安排实验。

Conclusion: 周期性无人值守、全自动地面段方案可行，能有效支持卫星通信任务及用户实验需求。

Abstract: We present our approach for a periodically unstaffed, fully automated ground
segment. The concept is in use for the first time on the German satellite
communications mission Heinrich Hertz on behalf of the German Space Agency at
DLR. Heinrich Hertz was launched in July 2023 and offers access to scientific
and technical experiments to its users. The mission utilizes major automation
concepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated
operations outside of office hours. The concept includes tracking, telemetry
and commanding (TTC) of the satellite. Pre-planned and automatically executed
schedules enable commanding without human interaction. The user mission
schedule is planned separately from the main mission schedule and is
automatically de-conflicted. The automatic monitoring concept monitors the
systems of the satellite and all assets in the ground segment and triggers
reactions in operator-configurable ways depending on the mission needs, for
example emergency notifications or automated execution of flight operation
procedures. Additionally, the concept also puts special emphasis on a
self-service user portal that provides flexible access 24/7, even when the
control center is not staffed. The portal allows external users of the payload
to schedule pre-defined experiments, monitor the live execution of the
experiment with browser-based displays and access ground station telemetry and
dedicated RF test equipment during the time of their scheduled experiment.
Tasks can be planned long in advance as well as with a short reaction time
(less than 1 minute), which allows, for example, the reconfiguration of the
payload during a running experiment.

Motivation: 从业者对解决PbD的规范目标理解不足，现有方法未考虑GDPR中问题与解决方案空间的复杂交集，因此需探索联合需求和系统规范方法。

Method: 回顾二手和相关一手研究，对从业者进行访谈，开发并评估用于PbD的需求和系统规范方法，并根据规范目标进行评估。

Result: GDPR中问题与解决方案空间的关系对支持PbD很重要，基于用原始法律概念建模GDPR内容的方法有助于实现规范目标。

Conclusion: 要在工程生命周期不同抽象层次满足GDPR需求以实现PbD，应在规范中捕捉GDPR文本中的法律知识，所提方法适合解决实际需求，但还需考虑未来有效实施的特定需求。

Abstract: Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for
the compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and
conjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There
is little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification
objectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the
complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In
this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system
specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:
We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with
practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the
underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We
developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification
for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The
relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is
instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the
modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to
specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification
transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed
throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to
achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in
specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure
compliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to
address practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future
effective operationalization of the approach.

individual firms to ensure both breadth and depth of coverage; (iii) a
Portfolio agent that uses reinforcement learning to combine the agent outputs
into a unified policy to generate the trading strategy; and (iv) a Risk Control
agent that adjusts portfolio positions in response to market volatility. We
evaluate the system on the constituents by the CSI 300 Index of China's A-share

Result: 得到IMF在对数凹和弱对数凹两种关键情况下的非渐近指数收敛保证。

Conclusion: 为IMF提供了非渐近指数收敛保证，为DSBM的理论保证奠定基础。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in
computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this
problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative
Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations
like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While
previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a
quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we
provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF
under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal
distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results
encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another
where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction
results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical
guarantees for DSBM.

Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model
robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing
methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their
application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space
perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner
maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized
estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the
underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed
formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient
optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide
generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We
also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation
shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.

Conclusion: DRAF算法能有效解决子组公平性研究中的计算和数据问题。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications
of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when
multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups
increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity
problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness
which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample
sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce
a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral
Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial
learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate
fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing
supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper
bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in
benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is
large so that many subgroups are very small.

Conclusion: 所提通用正则化框架能有效解决多输出回归的多元校准问题，提升模型校准效果。

Abstract: Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable
decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied,
defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression
remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate
calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,
which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to
univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,
we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to
enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank
functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest
density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces
calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral
transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a
regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.
Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both
marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new
PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal
variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality
reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that
unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a
subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes
the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability
is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle
queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks
that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret
guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also
propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for
improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards.
Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in
time, with strong theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出HollowFlow流生成模型，用非回溯图神经网络解决流和扩散模型计算复杂度高问题，在两个系统验证有显著加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流和扩散模型依赖样本似然计算，计算复杂度随系统规模n增大，难以用于大规模问题。

Method: 引入HollowFlow模型，利用非回溯图神经网络，强制块对角雅可比结构，使似然评估的反向传播次数为常数。

Result: 在两个不同规模系统上训练Boltzmann Generators，采样和似然评估时间显著减少，大系统有100倍加速。

Conclusion: HollowFlow模型有潜力解决高维科学问题的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific
applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability
distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical
challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood
computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering
them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce
$\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel
non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal
Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number
of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a
significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our
framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based
architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training
BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling
and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our
theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$
speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for
high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational
bottlenecks.

Result: 证明迭代更新在一般条件下能指数快速收敛到接近最优的专家加权。

Conclusion: 对该方法在多种合成和真实目标分布上进行了评估。

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for
black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a
weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is
proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can
model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them
for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do
this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with
auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a
Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field
theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case,
$t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial
latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples
which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density.
Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the
exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each
iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match
the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn
from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic
program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge
exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by
evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target
distributions.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is computationally expensive,
especially for complex models. Alternative methods make simplifying assumptions
about the posterior to reduce computational burden, but their impact on
predictive performance remains unclear. This paper compares MCMC and non-MCMC
methods for high-dimensional penalized regression, examining when computational
shortcuts are justified for prediction tasks.
  We conduct a comprehensive simulation study using high-dimensional tabular
data, then validate findings with empirical datasets featuring both continuous
and binary outcomes. An in-depth analysis of one dataset provides a
step-by-step tutorial implementing various algorithms in R.
  Our results show that mean-field variational inference consistently performs
comparably to MCMC methods. In simulations, mean-field VI exhibited 3-90\%
higher MSE across scenarios while reducing runtime by 7-30x compared to
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Empirical datasets revealed dramatic speed-ups
(100-400x) in some cases with similar or superior predictive performance.
However, performance varied: some cases showed over 100x MSE increases with
only 30x speed-ups, highlighting the context-dependent nature of these
trade-offs.

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入鲁棒的弱信号识别方法，推动了基于随机共振的检测方法发展，有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate
modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within
non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold
detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often
large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort
complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study
explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale
applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be
analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying
dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two
single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it
both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated
and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the
proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection
compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is
further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while
outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based
detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal
identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.

Abstract: The Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is a foundational tool for
analyzing neural spike train data. However, standard implementations rely on
discretizing spike times into binned count data, limiting temporal resolution
and scalability. Here, we develop Monte Carlo (MC) methods and polynomial
approximations (PA) to the continuous-time analog of these models, and show
them to be advantageous over their discrete-time counterparts. Further, we
propose using a set of exponentially scaled Laguerre polynomials as an
orthogonal temporal basis, which improves filter identification and yields
closed-form integral solutions under the polynomial approximation. Applied to
both synthetic and real spike-time data from rodent hippocampus, our methods
demonstrate superior accuracy and scalability compared to traditional binned
GLMs, enabling functional connectivity inference in large-scale neural
recordings that are temporally precise on the order of synaptic dynamical
timescales and in agreement with known anatomical properties of hippocampal
subregions. We provide open-source implementations of both MC and PA
estimators, optimized for GPU acceleration, to facilitate adoption in the
neuroscience community.

Abstract: Precisely defining consciousness and identifying the mechanisms that effect
it is a long-standing question, particularly relevant with advances in
artificial intelligence. The scientific community is divided between
physicalism and natural dualism. Physicalism posits consciousness is a physical
process that can be modeled computationally; natural dualism rejects this
hypothesis. Finding a computational model has proven elusive, particularly
because of conflation of consciousness with other cognitive capabilities
exhibited by humans, such as intelligence and physiological sensations. Here we
show such a computational model that precisely models consciousness, natural or
artificial, identifying the structural and functional mechanisms that effect
it, confirming the physicalism hypothesis. We found such a model is obtainable
when including the underlying (biological or digital) substrate and accounting
for reactive behavior in substrate sub-systems (e.g., autonomous physiological
responses). Results show that, unlike all other computational processes,
consciousness is not independent of its substrate and possessing it is an
evolutionary advantage for intelligent entities. Our result shows there is no
impediment to the realization of fully artificial consciousness but,
surprisingly, that it is also possible to realize artificial intelligence of
arbitrary level without consciousness whatsoever, and that there is no
advantage in imbuing artificial systems with consciousness.

Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even
trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners
to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning
algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are
uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to
understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify
incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the
human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable
model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons
by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually
demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial
distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art
accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over
existing approaches.

Motivation: 以往研究通常用单一表征相似性指标比较系统，而每个指标只能捕捉表征结构的一个方面，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用一系列表征相似性指标评估脑区或模型可分离性，采用Similarity Network Fusion（SNF）框架整合表征方面。

Result: 保留几何或调谐结构的指标有更强的基于区域的区分性，线性预测性等灵活映射的指标区分性较弱；SNF比单一指标产生更清晰的区域和模型家族级分离，聚类结果与视觉皮层的解剖和功能层次更吻合。

Conclusion: 几何和调谐编码特定特征，线性可解码信息更具全局性；SNF框架在整合表征方面表现出色，聚类结果优于单一指标。

Abstract: The extent to which different neural or artificial neural networks (models)
rely on equivalent representations to support similar tasks remains a central
question in neuroscience and machine learning. Prior work has typically
compared systems using a single representational similarity metric, yet each
captures only one facet of representational structure. To address this, we
leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics-each capturing a
distinct facet of representational correspondence, such as geometry, unit-level
tuning, or linear decodability-and assess brain region or model separability
using multiple complementary measures. Metrics that preserve geometric or
tuning structure (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield stronger region-based
discrimination, whereas more flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings suggest that geometry and tuning encode
brain-region- or model-family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable
information tends to be more globally shared across regions or models. To
integrate these complementary representational facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a framework originally developed for multi-omics data
integration. SNF produces substantially sharper regional and model family-level
separation than any single metric and yields robust composite similarity
profiles. Moreover, clustering cortical regions using SNF-derived similarity
scores reveals a clearer hierarchical organization that aligns closely with
established anatomical and functional hierarchies of the visual
cortex-surpassing the correspondence achieved by individual metrics.

Abstract: Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior
requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce
Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that
learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from
multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many
micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders,
applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained
on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known
graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while
achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.
Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions
during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for
each within-trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase-specific
graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and
provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network
organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to
explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating
data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions
during behavior.

Abstract: Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data
and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn
from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that,
even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations
can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift.
Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift
is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a
systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the
connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we
characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show
that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent
learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the
representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we
demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and
Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to
autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that
the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the
task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different
qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than
those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the
structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and
could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying
computation in the brain.

Abstract: Local convergence has emerged as a fundamental tool for analyzing sparse
random graph models. We introduce a new notion of local convergence, color
convergence, based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Color convergence fully
characterizes the class of random graphs that are well-behaved in the limit for
message-passing graph neural networks. Building on this, we propose the Refined
Configuration Model (RCM), a random graph model that generalizes the
configuration model. The RCM is universal with respect to local convergence
among locally tree-like random graph models, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi,
stochastic block and configuration models. Finally, this framework enables a
complete characterization of the random trees that arise as local limits of
such graphs.

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors,
comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of
these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet
remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent
developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor
segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy
computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible
for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we
propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three
distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an
attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a
dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The
ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and
accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was
trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The
proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average
Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for
Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These
results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor
segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method
provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of
meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding for arbitrary block codes remains
fundamentally hard, with worst-case time complexity-measured by the total
number of multiplications-being no better than straightforward exhaustive
search, which requires $q^{k} n$ operations for an $[n,k]_q$ code. This paper
introduces a simple, code-agnostic framework that reduces the worst-case
complexity by a factor of $n$, down to $q^{k}$ operations, a highly desirable
reduction in practice. The result holds for both linear and nonlinear block
codes over general memoryless channels and under both hard-decision and
soft-decision decoding. It naturally extends to intersymbol-interference (ISI)
channels and ML list decoding with only a negligible increase in complexity.
Our core insight is that, upon receipt of each sequence at the receiver, the
conditional probability of that sequence for each codeword in the codebook
(i.e., the \emph{likelihood}) can be expressed as the inner product of two
carefully constructed vectors -- the first depending on the received sequence,
and the second on that codeword itself. As a result, evaluating the likelihoods
for all codewords in the codebook reduces to a single vector-matrix
multiplication, and ML decoding (MLD) becomes the simple task of picking the
maximum entry in the resulting vector. The only non-trivial cost lies in the
vector-matrix product. However, our matrix construction allows the use of the
Mailman algorithm to reduce this cost. This time reduction is achieved at the
cost of high space complexity, requiring $\mathcal{O}(q^{k+1} n)$ space to
store the pre-computed codebook matrix.

Abstract: Generative models that maximize model likelihood have gained traction in many
practical settings. Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many
strong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and
limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter
likelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and
efficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the
classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise
perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured
noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise
distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization
effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with
standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian
channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,
showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood
(NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA
results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation,
and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了替代AlphaFold3模型中Pairformer的Pairmixer，它消除了三角注意力，提高计算效率，在多个基准测试中表现出色，减轻下游应用的计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold虽变革了蛋白质结构预测，但大规模应用时运行时间和内存成本过高，Pairformer是主要瓶颈。

Method: 引入Pairmixer，消除三角注意力，保留高阶几何推理能力。

Result: Pairmixer提高计算效率，在折叠和对接基准测试中与现有最佳结构预测器相当，长序列推理速度快4倍，降低训练成本34%。

Conclusion: Pairmixer的高效性减轻了下游应用的计算负担，如在BoltzDesign中采样速度提高2倍以上，可处理更长序列。

Abstract: AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging
applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de
novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and
memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer
backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive
triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We
introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle
attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that
are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves
computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across
folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long
sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the
computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein
complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based
design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster
sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of
Pairformer.

Motivation: 解决由偏微分方程控制的一大类不适定逆问题，寻找比标准方法更优的解决方案。

Method: 采用迭代正则化方案，在基于有限元方法（FEM）的反演和学习的图神经网络正则化之间交替进行，利用FEM离散化的图结构，使用受物理启发的图神经网络作为正则化器。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架是解决此类不适定逆问题的有效方法，比传统方法更具优势。

Abstract: We present a framework for solving a broad class of ill-posed inverse
problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), where the target
coefficients of the forward operator are recovered through an iterative
regularization scheme that alternates between FEM-based inversion and learned
graph neural regularization. The forward problem is numerically solved using
the finite element method (FEM), enabling applicability to a wide range of
geometries and PDEs. By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM
discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned
regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative
to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework
outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate
reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The model of relative-error property testing of Boolean functions has been
the subject of significant recent research effort [CDH+24][CPPS25a][CPPS25b] In
this paper we consider the problem of relative-error testing an unknown and
arbitrary $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ for the property of being a unate
function, i.e. a function that is either monotone non-increasing or monotone
non-decreasing in each of the $n$ input variables.
  Our first result is a one-sided non-adaptive algorithm for this problem that
makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries, where $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$
is the number of satisfying assignments of the function that is being tested
and the value of $N$ is given as an input parameter to the algorithm.
  Building on this algorithm, we next give a one-sided adaptive algorithm for
this problem that does not need to be given the value of $N$ and with high
probability makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries.
  We also give lower bounds for both adaptive and non-adaptive two-sided
algorithms that are given the value of $N$ up to a constant multiplicative
factor. In the non-adaptive case, our lower bounds essentially match the
complexity of the algorithm that we provide.

TL;DR: 随着物联网设备增多和场景丰富，传感器数据量爆炸式增长，能耗大且有数据冗余。提出Senses在线节能方案，采用多智能体强化学习，在不同层面处理数据冗余，实验表明可节能并延长设备网络运行时长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生大量数据，计算和传输能耗大，且存在数据冗余问题，需要节能解决方案。

Method: 提出Senses方案，采用多智能体强化学习，在传感器层动态调整覆盖范围去重，在控制器层进行数据分区和冗余消除，在全局层平衡设备运行时长。

Result: Senses在控制设备上节省11.37%能耗，延长物联网设备网络20%的整体运行时长。

Conclusion: Senses能有效节省边缘物联网网络能耗，延长整体运行时长。

Abstract: As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuously grows and
application scenarios constantly enrich, the volume of sensor data experiences
an explosive increase. However, substantial data demands considerable energy
during computation and transmission. Redundant deployment or mobile assistance
is essential to cover the target area reliably with fault-prone sensors.
Consequently, the ``butterfly effect" may appear during the IoT operation,
since unreasonable data overlap could result in many duplicate data. To this
end, we propose Senses, a novel online energy saving solution for edge IoT
networks, with the insight of sensing and storing less at the network edge by
adopting Muti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Senses achieves data
de-duplication by dynamically adjusting sensor coverage at the sensor level.
For exceptional cases where sensor coverage cannot be altered, Senses conducts
data partitioning and eliminates redundant data at the controller level.
Furthermore, at the global level, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
Senses balances the operational duration among the devices to prolong the
overall operational duration of edge IoT networks. We evaluate the performance
of Senses through testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that
Senses saves 11.37% of energy consumption on control devices and prolongs 20%
overall operational duration of the IoT device network.

Motivation: 传统电池供电传感器网络寿命有限、维护频繁，WRSNs在动态条件下平衡节点存活率和充电能效有挑战。

Method: 提出增强进化多目标深度强化学习算法，集成基于LSTM的策略网络、基于多层感知器的预期增量模型和时变帕累托策略评估方法。

Result: 所提算法在平衡节点存活率和能效方面显著优于现有方法，LSTM增强策略网络收敛快25%，时变评估方法能有效适应动态条件。

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效应对WRSNs挑战，在平衡节点存活率和能效上表现出色。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in sensor networks, conventional battery-powered
sensor networks suffer from limited operational lifespans and frequent
maintenance requirements that severely constrain their deployment in remote and
inaccessible environments. As such, wireless rechargeable sensor networks
(WRSNs) with mobile charging capabilities offer a promising solution to extend
network lifetime. However, WRSNs face critical challenges from the inherent
trade-off between maximizing the node survival rates and maximizing charging
energy efficiency under dynamic operational conditions. In this paper, we
investigate a typical scenario where mobile chargers move and charge the
sensor, thereby maintaining the network connectivity while minimizing the
energy waste. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem
that simultaneously maximizes the network node survival rate and mobile charger
energy usage efficiency across multiple time slots, which presents NP-hard
computational complexity with long-term temporal dependencies that make
traditional optimization approaches ineffective. To address these challenges,
we propose an enhanced evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning
algorithm, which integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based policy
network for temporal pattern recognition, a multilayer perceptron-based
prospective increment model for future state prediction, and a time-varying
Pareto policy evaluation method for dynamic preference adaptation. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms existing approaches in balancing node survival rate and energy
efficiency while generating diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. Moreover, the
LSTM-enhanced policy network converges 25% faster than conventional networks,
with the time-varying evaluation method effectively adapting to dynamic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互联网速度测试基于静态泛洪设计成本高，需提前停止测试以降低负担且不牺牲准确性。

Method: 将吞吐量预测和测试终止解耦为两个阶段，利用传输层特征训练回归器和分类器，设置可调参数和回退机制。

Result: 在173,000个M - Lab NDT速度测试中，TURBOTEST比基于BBR信号的方法数据节省近2 - 4倍，且减少中位误差。

Conclusion: 基于自适应机器学习的终止方法可大规模提供准确、高效且可部署的速度测试。

Abstract: Internet speed tests are indispensable for users, ISPs, and policymakers, but
their static flooding-based design imposes growing costs: a single high-speed
test can transfer hundreds of megabytes, and collectively, platforms like
Ookla, M-Lab, and Fast.com generate petabytes of traffic each month. Reducing
this burden requires deciding when a test can be stopped early without
sacrificing accuracy. We frame this as an optimal stopping problem and show
that existing heuristics-static thresholds, BBR pipe-full signals, or
throughput stability rules from Fast.com and FastBTS-capture only a narrow
portion of the achievable accuracy-savings trade-off. This paper introduces
TURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop
existing platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1)
from test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final
throughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to
decide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop. Leveraging richer
transport-level features (RTT, retransmissions, congestion window) alongside
throughput, TURBOTEST exposes a single tunable parameter for accuracy tolerance
and includes a fallback mechanism for high-variability cases. Evaluation on
173,000 M-Lab NDT speed tests (2024-2025) shows that TURBOTEST achieves nearly
2-4x higher data savings than an approach based on BBR signals while reducing
median error. These results demonstrate that adaptive ML-based termination can
deliver accurate, efficient, and deployable speed tests at scale.

Motivation: 传统方法无法从2D平面图像生成3D活动图，而核医学剂量测定需要此技术，现有方法存在成本高、耗时长等问题。

Method: 生成患者特定数据集，采用AI方法（3DUnet和扩散模型）从2D平面图像生成3D活动图，并在模拟和真实平面采集中验证。

Result: 患者特异性强化学习效果增强，结合扩散模型和患者特定训练有更好的器官轮廓和患者解剖结构，模拟和与SPECT对比的SSIM分别达0.89和0.73。

Conclusion: 该方法可改变核医学剂量测定范式，仅用平面闪烁成像实现3D量化，无需昂贵耗时的SPECT。

Abstract: In this work we explored the use of patient specific reinforced learning to
generate 3D activity maps from two 2D planar images (anterior and posterior).
The solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional
methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine
where approaches for post-therapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as
177Lu-PSMA are typically done via either expensive and long 3D SPECT
acquisitions or fast, yet only 2D, planar scintigraphy. Being able to generate
3D activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry
applications removing the need for SPECT and facilitating multi-time point
dosimetry studies. Our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific
dataset with possible 3D uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the
anatomy of the individual followed by an AI approach (we explored both the use
of 3DUnet and diffusion models) able to generate 3D activity maps from 2D
planar images. We have validated our method both in simulation and real planar
acquisitions. We observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement
learning (~20% reduction on MAE and ~5% increase in SSIM) and better organ
delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with
patient specific training yielding a SSIM=0.89 compared to the ground truth for
simulations and 0.73 when compared to a SPECT acquisition performed half an
hour after the planar. We believe that our methodology can set a change of
paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for 3D quantification using
only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and time-consuming SPECT
leveraging the pre-therapy information of the patients.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under

terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.

Conclusion: GSL的结构化且灵活设计能显著提升样本效率和泛化性。

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 将机器人姿态估计定位为CRL的近实际测试平台。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

Result: 目标条件框架使插入点精度相比仅任务基线提高59%-74%。

Conclusion: 这些工作支持可重复评估和开发端到端缝合所需的注重精度、长视野的灵巧操作策略。

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in
surgery. These contributions support reproducible evaluation and development of
precision-focused, long-horizon dexterous manipulation policies necessary for
end-to-end suturing. Dataset is available at:

Motivation: 解决强化学习处理原始视觉输入时对分布外变化脆弱，以及点云强化学习对相机姿态不匹配敏感的问题。

Method: 提出PCA Point Cloud (PPC)规范框架，将任意刚体变换下的点云映射到唯一规范姿态。

Result: 实验表明PPC在具有挑战性的机器人任务中提高了对未见相机姿态的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PPC为领域随机化提供了一种有原则的替代方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Motivation: 现实机器人操作需触觉感知，但触觉在强化学习中效果不稳定，需有效利用触觉观测。

Method: 开发自监督学习方法，聚焦本体感觉和稀疏二进制接触的可扩展设置。

Result: 稀疏二进制触觉信号对灵巧操作关键，代理在复杂接触任务达超人灵巧度，解耦记忆可提升性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，发布RoTO基准推动触觉操作研究。

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Method: 建立PCA主子空间估计误差的中心极限定理，推导其超额风险在重构损失下的渐近分布；证明负块瑞利商在格拉斯曼流形上沿特定测地线具有广义自和谐性。

Result: 得到PCA超额风险的非渐近上界，在大样本极限下与渐近特征一致。

Conclusion: 明确了数据分布中影响PCA超额风险的因素，通过理论推导得到相关结果。

Abstract: What property of the data distribution determines the excess risk of
principal component analysis? In this paper, we provide a precise answer to
this question. We establish a central limit theorem for the error of the
principal subspace estimated by PCA, and derive the asymptotic distribution of
its excess risk under the reconstruction loss. We obtain a non-asymptotic upper
bound on the excess risk of PCA that recovers, in the large sample limit, our
asymptotic characterization. Underlying our contributions is the following
result: we prove that the negative block Rayleigh quotient, defined on the
Grassmannian, is generalized self-concordant along geodesics emanating from its
minimizer of maximum rotation less than $\pi/4$.

Motivation: 执行性预测影响目标结果，破坏了正确预测和标准方法的存在，需要解决该问题。

Method: 对预测进行条件设定，分离预测与结果；证明一般不可能性结果并提出两个解决方案；将相关见解应用于参数估计。

Result: 条件预测和适当评分规则能实现执行性稳定的参数估计，解决了Perdomo等人（2020）提出的问题。

Conclusion: 揭示了经典预测评估的基本局限，为执行性环境下的可靠准确预测提供新工具。

Abstract: Performative predictions are forecasts which influence the outcomes they aim
to predict, undermining the existence of correct forecasts and standard methods
of elicitation and estimation. We show that conditioning forecasts on
covariates that separate them from the outcome renders the target distribution
forecast-invariant, guaranteeing well-posedness of the forecasting problem.
However, even under this condition, classical proper scoring rules fail to
elicit correct forecasts. We prove a general impossibility result and identify
two solutions: (i) in decision-theoretic settings, elicitation of correct and
incentive-compatible forecasts is possible if forecasts are separating; (ii)
scoring with unbiased estimates of the divergence between the forecast and the
induced distribution of the target variable yields correct forecasts. Applying
these insights to parameter estimation, conditional forecasts and proper
scoring rules enable performatively stable estimation of performatively correct
parameters, resolving the issues raised by Perdomo et al. (2020). Our results
expose fundamental limits of classical forecast evaluation and offer new tools
for reliable and accurate forecasting in performative settings.

Motivation: 为非线性GMM提供可扩展的随机近似框架。

Method: 从独立小批量矩及其导数进行迭代更新，开发二阶细化和基于随机缩放与插件方法的推理程序。

Result: 在蒙特卡罗实验中，SLIM求解模型时间远短于全样本GMM，去偏插件J检验有良好有限样本推断效果，能平滑扩展到n = 10^6。

Conclusion: SLIM是一种高效、可扩展的非线性GMM求解框架。

Abstract: We propose SLIM (Stochastic Learning and Inference in overidentified Models),
a scalable stochastic approximation framework for nonlinear GMM. SLIM forms
iterative updates from independent mini-batches of moments and their
derivatives, producing unbiased directions that ensure almost-sure convergence.
It requires neither a consistent initial estimator nor global convexity and
accommodates both fixed-sample and random-sampling asymptotics. We further
develop an optional second-order refinement and inference procedures based on
random scaling and plug-in methods, including plug-in, debiased plug-in, and
online versions of the Sargan--Hansen $J$-test tailored to stochastic learning.
In Monte Carlo experiments based on a nonlinear EASI demand system with 576
moment conditions, 380 parameters, and $n = 10^5$, SLIM solves the model in
under 1.4 hours, whereas full-sample GMM in Stata on a powerful laptop
converges only after 18 hours. The debiased plug-in $J$-test delivers
satisfactory finite-sample inference, and SLIM scales smoothly to $n = 10^6$.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在从单张图像重建3D对象时，反射率用简单材质模型表示或需额外步骤估计，无法高效实现重光照和外观编辑。

Result: 在多个以对象为中心的数据集上实现了最先进的重光照和新视图合成性能。

Conclusion: 该方法具有泛化性，能生成适用于AR/VR、电影、游戏等视觉媒体的可重光照3D资产。

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

Motivation: 挑战对Francis Ysidro Edgeworth的传统解读，重构其用数学统一道德科学的项目。

Method: 分析Edgeworth在早期写作中，以心理物理学和进化生物学为基础，将个体建模为‘准费希纳式’函数来解决功利主义问题。

Result: Edgeworth的反平等结论源于在自然不平等个体间最大化福利的必要性，其体系用科学中性化和合理化社会等级。

Conclusion: 后续经济学家去除其功利主义虽让工具更易接受，但破坏了其整体哲学体系。

Abstract: This article challenges the conventional reading of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth
by reconstructing his intellectual project of unifying the moral sciences
through mathematics. The contribution he made in the first phase of his
writing, culminating in \textit{Mathematical Psychics}, aimed to reconfigure
utilitarianism as an exact science, grounding it in psychophysics and
evolutionary biology. In order to solve the utilitarian problem of maximizing
pleasure for a given set of sentient beings, he modeled individuals as
``quasi-Fechnerian'' functions, which incorporated their capacity for pleasure
as determined by their place in the evolutionary order. The problem of
maximization is solved by distributing means according to the individuals'
capacity for pleasure. His radical anti-egalitarian conclusions did not stem
from an abstract principle of justice, but from the necessity to maximize
welfare among naturally unequal beings. This logic was applied not only to
sentients of different evolutionary orders, such as Mr. Pongo, a famous
gorilla, and humans, but also to human races, sexes, and classes. The system,
in essence, uses the apparent neutrality of science to naturalize and justify
pre-existing social hierarchies. This analysis reveals that the subsequent
surgical removal of his utilitarianism by economists, starting with Schumpeter,
while making his tools palatable, eviscerates his overarching philosophical
system.

Result: 智利改善了创新机构，但存在协调弱、区域不平等和知识文化脆弱的问题。

Conclusion: 实现包容性创新需要适应性治理和将创新视为公共产品的伦理愿景。

Abstract: The study explores the evolution of Chile's industrial policy from 1990 to
2022 through the lens of state capacity, innovation and endogenous development.
In a global context where governments are reasserting their role as active
agents of innovation, Chile presents a paradox. It is a stable and open economy
that has expanded investment in science and technology but still struggles to
transform this effort into sustainable capabilities. Drawing on the works of
Mazzucato, Aghion, Howitt, Mokyr, Samuelson and Sampedro, the study integrates
evolutionary economics, public policy and humanist ethics. Using a longitudinal
case study approach and official data, it finds that Chile has improved its
innovation institutions but continues to experience weak coordination, regional
inequality and a fragile culture of knowledge. The research concludes that
achieving inclusive innovation requires adaptive governance and an ethical
vision of innovation as a public good.

TL;DR: 本文在宏观经济基于主体的模型中分析央行数字货币（CBDC）引入对金融稳定和福利的影响，发现其会加剧银行挤兑，设置持有上限可改变影响，对宏观变量影响小，会导致财富再分配，设置上限可改善福利。


<details>

Motivation: 分析引入央行数字货币（CBDC）对金融稳定和福利的影响。

Method: 在宏观经济基于主体的模型中，考虑企业、银行和家庭在劳动力、商品、信贷和银行间市场的互动，家庭根据对银行风险的感知将流动性从存款转移到CBDC。

Result: 引入CBDC会加剧银行挤兑，可能导致金融不稳定；设置CBDC持有上限可改变影响；对宏观变量影响小，但企业贷款利率上升、信贷略有下降；导致财富从企业和银行向家庭再分配，银行违约率上升；可能有负面福利效应，设置持有上限可改善福利。

Conclusion: 引入CBDC有诸多影响，设置CBDC持有上限可缓解负面效应、改善福利。

Abstract: We analyse financial stability and welfare impacts associated with the
introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in a macroeconomic
agent-based model. The model considers firms, banks, and households interacting
on labour, goods, credit, and interbank markets. Households move their
liquidity from deposits to CBDC based on the perceived riskiness of their
banks. We find that the introduction of CBDC exacerbates bank-runs and may lead
to financial instability phenomena. The effect can be changed by introducing a
limit on CBDC holdings. The adoption of CBDC has little effect on macroeconomic
variables but the interest rate on loans to firms goes up and credit goes down
in a limited way. CBDC leads to a redistribution of wealth from firms and banks
to households with a higher bank default rate. CBDC may have negative welfare
effects, but a bound on holding enables a welfare improvement.

Result: 通过模拟研究对比了不同分布下Heckman选择模型的性能，并应用于医疗和劳动力供给数据。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯分析方法可行且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The Heckman selection model is widely used in econometric analysis and other
social sciences to address sample selection bias in data modeling. A common
assumption in Heckman selection models is that the error terms follow an
independent bivariate normal distribution. However, real-world data often
deviates from this assumption, exhibiting heavy-tailed behavior, which can lead
to inconsistent estimates if not properly addressed. In this paper, we propose
a Bayesian analysis of Heckman selection models that replace the Gaussian
assumption with well-known members of the class of scale mixture of normal
distributions, such as the Student's-t and contaminated normal distributions.
For these complex structures, Stan's default No-U-Turn sampler is utilized to
obtain posterior simulations. Through extensive simulation studies, we compare
the performance of the Heckman selection models with normal, Student's-t and
contaminated normal distributions. We also demonstrate the broad applicability
of this methodology by applying it to medical care and labor supply data. The
proposed algorithms are implemented in the R package HeckmanStan.

Conclusion: 所提出的变分方法能有效解决贝叶斯经验似然的计算问题，在成本和准确性上表现良好。

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on specifying a parametric model that
approximates the data-generating process. However, misspecified models can
yield poor convergence rates and unreliable posterior calibration. Bayesian
empirical likelihood offers a semi-parametric alternative by replacing the
parametric likelihood with a profile empirical likelihood defined through
moment constraints, thereby avoiding explicit distributional assumptions.
Despite these advantages, Bayesian empirical likelihood faces substantial
computational challenges, including the need to solve a constrained
optimization problem for each likelihood evaluation and difficulties with
non-convex posterior support, particularly in small-sample settings. This paper
introduces a variational approach based on expectation-propagation to
approximate the Bayesian empirical-likelihood posterior, balancing
computational cost and accuracy without altering the target posterior via
adjustments such as pseudo-observations. Empirically, we show that our approach
can achieve a superior cost-accuracy trade-off relative to existing methods,
including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Theoretically, we show
that the approximation and the Bayesian empirical-likelihood posterior are
asymptotically equivalent.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new form of digital experimentation
where treatments combine human and model-generated content in increasingly
sophisticated ways. The main methodological challenge in this setting is
representing these high-dimensional treatments without losing their semantic
meaning or rendering analysis intractable. Here, we address this problem by
focusing on learning low-dimensional representations that capture the
underlying structure of such treatments. These representations enable
downstream applications such as guiding generative models to produce meaningful
treatment variants and facilitating adaptive assignment in online experiments.
We propose double kernel representation learning, which models the causal
effect through the inner product of kernel-based representations of treatments
and user covariates. We develop an alternating-minimization algorithm that
learns these representations efficiently from data and provides convergence
guarantees under a low-rank factor model. As an application of this framework,
we introduce an adaptive design strategy for online experimentation and
demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: NLCR方法可有效解决非线性约束时间序列的预测问题，提升预测精度。

Abstract: Methods for forecasting time series adhering to linear constraints have seen
notable development in recent years, especially with the advent of forecast
reconciliation. This paper extends forecast reconciliation to the open question
of non-linearly constrained time series. Non-linear constraints can emerge with
variables that are formed as ratios such as mortality rates and unemployment
rates. On the methodological side, Non-linearly Constrained Reconciliation
(NLCR) is proposed. This algorithm adjusts forecasts that fail to meet
non-linear constraints, in a way that ensures the new forecasts meet the
constraints. The NLCR method is a projection onto a non-linear surface,
formulated as a constrained optimisation problem. On the theoretical side,
optimisation methods are again used, this time to derive sufficient conditions
for when the NLCR methodology is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy.
Finally on the empirical side, NLCR is applied to two datasets from demography
and economics and shown to significantly improve forecast accuracy relative to
relevant benchmarks.

Conclusion: JSTprove既满足当前工程需求，又为可验证AI的未来研究和生产部署提供可复现基础。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) systems into critical industries
such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity has transformed decision-making
processes, but it also brings new challenges around trust, security, and
accountability. As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring the transparency
and correctness of AI-driven decisions is crucial, especially when they have
direct consequences on privacy, security, or fairness. Verifiable AI, powered
by Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), offers a robust solution to these
challenges. zkML enables the verification of AI model inferences without
exposing sensitive data, providing an essential layer of trust and privacy.
However, traditional zkML systems typically require deep cryptographic
expertise, placing them beyond the reach of most ML engineers. In this paper,
we introduce JSTprove, a specialized zkML toolkit, built on Polyhedra Network's
Expander backend, to enable AI developers and ML engineers to generate and
verify proofs of AI inference. JSTprove provides an end-to-end verifiable AI
inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a simple
command-line interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility.
We present the design, innovations, and real-world use cases of JSTprove as
well as our blueprints and tooling to encourage community review and extension.
JSTprove therefore serves both as a usable zkML product for current engineering
needs and as a reproducible foundation for future research and production
deployments of verifiable AI.

Result: 能以80.9%的准确率从源代码自动生成访问控制策略；能阻止多个恶意MCP服务器中的大多数安全威胁；策略执行引擎引入的开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 为开发者和项目经理保障MCP服务器安全并维持生产力提供实用基础，促使研究人员和工具开发者探索声明性访问控制和MCP安全的新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with
external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context
Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such
resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute
with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In
this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP
servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the
Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains
malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a
dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access
control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%
accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats
in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces
negligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers
with a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining
productivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions
for declarative access control and MCP security.

### [253] [LLM-Powered Detection of Price Manipulation in DeFi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21272)
*Lu Liu,Wuqi Zhang,Lili Wei,Hao Guan,Yongqiang Tian,Yepang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 现有DeFi智能合约价格操纵漏洞检测方法有限，本文提出结合静态分析与LLM推理的PMDetector框架，实验表明其效果好、成本低且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi智能合约管理巨额资金，价格操纵漏洞攻击危害大，现有检测方法有局限性，需新检测方案。

Method: 提出PMDetector混合框架，采用形式化攻击模型和三阶段管道，结合静态污点分析、LLM处理和静态分析检查。

Result: 使用73个真实漏洞和288个良性DeFi协议数据集评估，Gemini 2.5 - flash下精确率88%、召回率90%，GPT - 4.1审计成本低、速度快。

Conclusion: PMDetector是检测DeFi智能合约价格操纵漏洞的高效、经济的替代方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts manage billions of dollars,
making them a prime target for exploits. Price manipulation vulnerabilities,
often via flash loans, are a devastating class of attacks causing significant
financial losses. Existing detection methods are limited. Reactive approaches
analyze attacks only after they occur, while proactive static analysis tools
rely on rigid, predefined heuristics, limiting adaptability. Both depend on
known attack patterns, failing to identify novel variants or comprehend complex
economic logic. We propose PMDetector, a hybrid framework combining static
analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning to proactively detect
price manipulation vulnerabilities. Our approach uses a formal attack model and
a three-stage pipeline. First, static taint analysis identifies potentially
vulnerable code paths. Second, a two-stage LLM process filters paths by
analyzing defenses and then simulates attacks to evaluate exploitability.
Finally, a static analysis checker validates LLM results, retaining only
high-risk paths and generating comprehensive vulnerability reports. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we built a dataset of 73 real-world vulnerable and 288
benign DeFi protocols. Results show PMDetector achieves 88% precision and 90%
recall with Gemini 2.5-flash, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
static analysis and LLM-based approaches. Auditing a vulnerability with
PMDetector costs just $0.03 and takes 4.0 seconds with GPT-4.1, offering an
efficient and cost-effective alternative to manual audits.

TL;DR: 提出FLAMES方法，用领域适配大语言模型为智能合约合成运行时防护，评估显示其有效，证明可自动生成安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化分析工具无法为智能合约生成可部署的防御，智能合约漏洞造成巨大损失。

Method: 采用通过在从514,506个已验证合约中提取的真实世界不变量上进行填空式监督微调训练的领域适配大语言模型，合成Solidity“require”语句作为运行时防护。

Result: 合成不变量编译成功率达96.7%；在5000个具有挑战性的不变量测试集上，44.5%的情况能产生与真实值精确或语义等效的匹配；防止108个真实漏洞中的22个（20.4%）；成功阻止真实世界的APEMAGA事件。

Conclusion: 领域适配大语言模型可以在无需漏洞检测、形式化规范和人工干预的情况下，自动为智能合约生成可用于生产的安全防护。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions of dollars annually, yet
existing automated analysis tools fail to generate deployable defenses. We
present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime
guards as Solidity "require" statements to harden smart contracts against
exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic
analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted
large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning
on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our
extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's
effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for
synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000
challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent
matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES
prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract
functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA
incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES
establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate
production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring
vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We
release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to
enable reproducible research in this critical domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理解网络攻击行为方式无法满足实时防御需求，需从底层系统遥测数据推断攻击者意图和认知策略。

Method: 提出利用大语言模型分析Suricata IDS日志的框架，开发策略驱动提示系统高效分割网络日志数据，将网络层事件映射到攻击者高层策略。

Result: 大语言模型能弥合数据包级日志和战略意图间的语义差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为认知自适应网络防御和认知特征推断奠定基础。

Abstract: Understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied
on high-level intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains.
However, real-time defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and
cognitive strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as intrusion
detection system (IDS) logs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer
attacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded
in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases
such as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be
extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays
the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and
cognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to
segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a
highly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely
techniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to
high-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such
as tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to
psychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs
can bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent,
offering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.

Motivation: 调查UAM车辆自主导航和着陆系统的漏洞，聚焦针对深度学习模型的特洛伊攻击。

Method: 使用DroNet框架评估UAAVs的脆弱性，收集自定义数据集、训练模型模拟真实情况，开发评估框架识别受感染模型。

Result: 实验显示，正常数据准确率96.4%，受特洛伊攻击数据准确率降至73.3%。

Conclusion: 表明特洛伊攻击存在安全风险，为增强UAM系统弹性的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and
landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses
on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within
a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain
conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations.
We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using
the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy,
from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To
conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to
simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework
designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the
potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for
future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文评估本地微调大语言模型对x86逆向工程的辅助作用，发现微调后的Qwen2.5 - Coder - 7B（REx86）表现最佳，证明特定领域微调的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: x86二进制逆向工程速度慢，云托管闭源模型有隐私和安全风险，无法用于封闭网络，需本地大语言模型辅助。

Method: 对CodeLlama、Qwen2.5 - Coder和CodeGemma系列的8个开源模型在5981个x86汇编示例的自定义数据集上进行参数高效微调。

Result: REx86降低测试集交叉熵损失64.2%，提高语义余弦相似度20.3%；用户案例中增强代码理解，正确解决率从31%提升到53%；定性分析显示注释更准确、简洁，幻觉减少。

Conclusion: REx86在本地开源大语言模型中为x86逆向工程提供了最先进的辅助，特定领域微调有价值，需更多带注释反汇编数据提升性能。

Abstract: Reverse engineering (RE) of x86 binaries is indispensable for malware and
firmware analysis, but remains slow due to stripped metadata and adversarial
obfuscation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for improving RE
efficiency through automated comprehension and commenting, but cloud-hosted,
closed-weight models pose privacy and security risks and cannot be used in
closed-network facilities. We evaluate parameter-efficient fine-tuned local
LLMs for assisting with x86 RE tasks in these settings. Eight open-weight
models across the CodeLlama, Qwen2.5-Coder, and CodeGemma series are fine-tuned
on a custom curated dataset of 5,981 x86 assembly examples. We evaluate them
quantitatively and identify the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B as the top
performer, which we name REx86.
  REx86 reduces test-set cross-entropy loss by 64.2% and improves semantic
cosine similarity against ground truth by 20.3\% over its base model. In a
limited user case study (n=43), REx86 significantly enhanced line-level code
understanding (p = 0.031) and increased the correct-solve rate from 31% to 53%
(p = 0.189), though the latter did not reach statistical significance.
Qualitative analysis shows more accurate, concise comments with fewer
hallucinations.
  REx86 delivers state-of-the-art assistance in x86 RE among local, open-weight
LLMs. Our findings demonstrate the value of domain-specific fine-tuning, and
highlight the need for more commented disassembly data to further enhance LLM
performance in RE. REx86, its dataset, and LoRA adapters are publicly available

Method: 使用严格的三层攻击方法，针对新的200提示CBRN数据集和180提示的FORTRESS基准子集，对10个领先商业大语言模型进行评估。

Result: Deep Inception攻击成功率达86.0%，模型安全性能差异大，8个模型在增强危险材料属性时脆弱性超70%，简单提示工程技术可绕过安全防护。

Conclusion: 当前安全对齐存在根本脆弱性，挑战行业安全宣称，迫切需要标准化评估框架、透明安全指标和更强大的对齐技术来降低灾难性滥用风险。

Abstract: Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) pose unprecedented dual-use risks
through the potential proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) weapons knowledge. We present the first comprehensive evaluation
of 10 leading commercial LLMs against both a novel 200-prompt CBRN dataset and
a 180-prompt subset of the FORTRESS benchmark, using a rigorous three-tier
attack methodology. Our findings expose critical safety vulnerabilities: Deep
Inception attacks achieve 86.0\% success versus 33.8\% for direct requests,
demonstrating superficial filtering mechanisms; Model safety performance varies
dramatically from 2\% (claude-opus-4) to 96\% (mistral-small-latest) attack
success rates; and eight models exceed 70\% vulnerability when asked to enhance
dangerous material properties. We identify fundamental brittleness in current
safety alignment, where simple prompt engineering techniques bypass safeguards
for dangerous CBRN information. These results challenge industry safety claims
and highlight urgent needs for standardized evaluation frameworks, transparent
safety metrics, and more robust alignment techniques to mitigate catastrophic
misuse risks while preserving beneficial capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOICE能仅用单张面部图像生成逼真合成语音绕过认证系统，面部图像易获取，引发安全担忧，需研究其检测问题。

Method: 系统评估FOICE检测，引入针对FOICE特定伪影的微调策略，评估微调后的泛化性。

Result: 领先检测器在标准和嘈杂条件下均检测失败，微调策略显著提高准确率，微调后存在专业化和泛化性的权衡。

Conclusion: 当今防御存在根本弱点，需为下一代音频深度伪造检测开发新架构和训练协议。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of
increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio
deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly
alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,
without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial
and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass
industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and
Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are
far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering
the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core
research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors
reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and
(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection
without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators
such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic
evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail
under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted
fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding
significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after
fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and
robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental
weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training
protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在代理系统中处理不可信数据时易受提示注入攻击，需解决该局限性。

Method: 提出SIC，通过迭代提示清理循环，反复检查输入数据中的恶意指令，对恶意内容进行重写、屏蔽或移除，直至输入干净或达到最大迭代次数。

Result: 虽然SIC可立即使用，但最坏情况分析显示，强大对手仍能通过嵌入非命令式工作流获得15%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: SIC虽非完美，但提高了防范提示注入攻击的门槛。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems
that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to
prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective
iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our
method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise
agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten,
masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until
the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative
instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By
allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites
may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later
steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not
infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding
non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.

Motivation: 现有蜜罐提升攻击者参与度需上下文感知能力，使用大语言模型存在准确性、响应时间、成本和数据保护等问题，需改进。

Method: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地大语言模型；研究RAG和非RAG大语言模型用于Linux shell命令，用多种指标评估。

Result: RAG提高未调优模型准确性，调优的非RAG模型不使用RAG也能达到类似准确性且延迟稍低。

Conclusion: SBASH框架结合轻量级本地大语言模型能有效解决蜜罐数据保护问题，调优的非RAG大语言模型在蜜罐应用中有一定优势。

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

Method: 对四个不同AI安全承诺和来源国的大语言模型生成的超150万美国41种职业角色进行大规模审计，并与劳工统计局数据对比。

Result: 发现系统性偏差和刻板印象放大两种模式，白人和黑人被低估，西班牙裔和亚裔被高估，部分职业呈现极端扭曲。

Conclusion: HCI领域中，模型选择会影响人物可见性，需进行特定模型审计和责任设计实践。

Abstract: Generative AI tools are increasingly used to create portrayals of people in
occupations, raising concerns about how race and gender are represented. We
conducted a large-scale audit of over 1.5 million occupational personas across
41 U.S. occupations, generated by four large language models with different AI
safety commitments and countries of origin (U.S., China, France). Compared with
Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we find two recurring patterns: systematic
shifts, where some groups are consistently under- or overrepresented, and
stereotype exaggeration, where existing demographic skews are amplified. On
average, White (--31pp) and Black (--9pp) workers are underrepresented, while
Hispanic (+17pp) and Asian (+12pp) workers are overrepresented. These
distortions can be extreme: for example, across all four models, Housekeepers
are portrayed as nearly 100\% Hispanic, while Black workers are erased from
many occupations. For HCI, these findings show provider choice materially
changes who is visible, motivating model-specific audits and accountable design
practices.

Abstract: With the current progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its
increasingly broader applications, trust is seen as a required criterion for AI
usage, acceptance, and deployment. A robust measurement instrument is essential
to correctly evaluate trust from a human-centered perspective. This paper
describes the development and validation process of a trust measure instrument,
which follows psychometric principles, and consists of a 16-items trust scale.
The instrument was built explicitly for research in human-AI interaction to
measure trust attitudes towards AI systems from layperson (non-expert)
perspective. The use-case we used to develop the scale was in the context of AI
medical support systems (specifically cancer/health prediction). The scale
development (Measurement Item Development) and validation (Measurement Item
Evaluation) involved six research stages: item development, item evaluation,
survey administration, test of dimensionality, test of reliability, and test of
validity. The results of the six-stages evaluation show that the proposed trust
measurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically
measuring and comparing non-experts' trust in AI Medical Support Systems.

Motivation: 传统监测学生注意力方法有局限，现有BCI方法缺乏实时验证和评估，需新方法解决。

Method: 用非侵入式EEG头带收集20名参与者观看教育视频脑电数据，用问卷验证数据，处理信号、提取特征，用SVM分类，进行LOSO交叉验证，开展试点研究评估反馈效果。

Result: LOSO交叉验证准确率88.77%，系统能检测非注意力状态并反馈，试点研究中配对t检验显示反馈阶段注意力显著提升。

Conclusion: 开发的BCI系统能有效监测学生注意力，实时反馈可提高学生注意力。

Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring
of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire
assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to
provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by
mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based
approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address
these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a
non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record
brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data
were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational
video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire
assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window),
filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG
artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical
features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE)
with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention
states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been
tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention
state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a
10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback
followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if
participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A
paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant
improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲸鱼声音事件检测系统存在误报和少数类检测的问题。

Method: 提出BPN，利用骨干分类模型的中间潜在表示对最终输出进行门控；考虑前向搜索和后向搜索两种后处理超参数选择方法。

Result: BPN使精度绝对提高16.8%，少数类d - calls和bp - calls的F1分数分别提高21.3%和9.4%；完整的WhaleVAD - BPN系统交叉验证开发F1分数达到0.475，比基线提高9.8%。

Conclusion: BPN和两种超参数选择方法有效提升了鲸鱼声音事件检测系统的性能。

Abstract: While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale
calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class
detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which
extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in
image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive
detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations
computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output.
When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute
increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score
for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two
approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a
forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and
frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable
performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The
complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of
0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN处理音频分类时难以捕捉通道间相关性，QCNNs虽能解决但计算复杂度高，在资源受限平台部署有挑战。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏（KD）和剪枝方法降低QCNNs计算复杂度。

Result: 剪枝QCNNs比KD性能相当或更优且计算量少，相比传统CNN和Transformer架构，参数和计算复杂度降低且性能有竞争力，在AudioSet数据集降低成本和参数，在多基准测试中泛化性好。

Conclusion: 剪枝是降低QCNNs计算复杂度同时保持性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the real domain have
been widely used for audio classification. However, their convolution
operations process multi-channel inputs independently, limiting the ability to
capture correlations among channels. This can lead to suboptimal feature
learning, particularly for complex audio patterns such as multi-channel
spectrogram representations. Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs)
address this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture
inter-channel dependencies, enabling more compact models with fewer learnable
parameters while better exploiting the multi-dimensional nature of audio
signals. However, QCNNs exhibit higher computational complexity due to the
overhead of quaternion operations, resulting in increased inference latency and
reduced efficiency compared to conventional CNNs, posing challenges for
deployment on resource-constrained platforms. To address this challenge, this
study explores knowledge distillation (KD) and pruning, to reduce the
computational complexity of QCNNs while maintaining performance. Our
experiments on audio classification reveal that pruning QCNNs achieves similar
or superior performance compared to KD while requiring less computational
effort. Compared to conventional CNNs and Transformer-based architectures,
pruned QCNNs achieve competitive performance with a reduced learnable parameter
count and computational complexity. On the AudioSet dataset, pruned QCNNs
reduce computational cost by 50\% and parameter count by 80\%, while
maintaining performance comparable to the conventional CNNs. Furthermore,
pruned QCNNs generalize well across multiple audio classification benchmarks,
including GTZAN for music genre recognition, ESC-50 for environmental sound
classification and RAVDESS for speech emotion recognition.

Result: 预训练出3.8B参数的SpeLangy模型，在绝对性能上比大3倍的模型高10.2%。

Conclusion: 有效数据整理对语音语言预训练有重要影响，可为未来语音语言模型的数据中心探索提供指导。

Abstract: Spoken Question-Answering (SQA) is a core capability for useful and
interactive artificial intelligence systems. Recently, several speech-language
models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their
SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data
processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account
for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data
modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric
exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions
fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw
web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct
synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to
interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the
insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a
3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up
to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the
impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide
future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模模拟化学反应速率和化学稳定性的方法存在局限性，如直接模拟时间尺度短、机器学习势数据需求大等。

Method: 在OT - GP框架下共同设计物理表示、统计模型和系统架构，结合EON软件重写、强化学习方法。

Result: 大规模基准测试和贝叶斯分层验证展示了先进性能，可实际探索化学动力学。

Conclusion: 建立了以表示为优先的模块化化学动力学模拟方法，将理论转化为实际应用。

Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet
efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite
advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by
short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and
struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction
network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational
cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like
harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point
searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by
overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical
representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal
Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal
transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the
potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling.
Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce
reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the
final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are
specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first,
modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and
Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding
theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.

Motivation: 随着通信网络复杂度增加，需在无明确环境知识下，利用CSI进行几何感知特征提取，以连接物理层测量和网络智能。

Method: 提出定向虚拟障碍模型，定义反射区并推导其解析表达式，构建物理信息深度学习框架。

Result: 除重构阻塞和反射几何外，所提模型构建MIMO波束图的准确率提高32%-48%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效在无明确环境知识下构建更准确的MIMO波束图和环境几何。

Abstract: As communication networks evolve towards greater complexity (e.g., 6G and
beyond), a deep understanding of the wireless environment becomes increasingly
crucial. When explicit knowledge of the environment is unavailable,
geometry-aware feature extraction from channel state information (CSI) emerges
as a pivotal methodology to bridge physical-layer measurements with network
intelligence. This paper proposes to explore the received signal strength (RSS)
data, without explicit 3D environment knowledge, to jointly construct the radio
beam map and environmental geometry for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system. Unlike existing methods that only learn blockage structures, we propose
an oriented virtual obstacle model that captures the geometric features of both
blockage and reflection. Reflective zones are formulated to identify relevant
reflected paths according to the geometry relation of the environment. We
derive an analytical expression for the reflective zone and further analyze its
geometric characteristics to develop a reformulation that is more compatible
with deep learning representations. A physics-informed deep learning framework
that incorporates the reflective-zone-based geometry model is proposed to learn
the blockage, reflection, and scattering components, along with the beam
pattern, which leverages physics prior knowledge to enhance network
transferability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to
reconstructing the blockage and reflection geometry, the proposed model can
construct a more accurate MIMO beam map with a 32%-48% accuracy improvement.

Abstract: Nowadays, there has been a growing trend in the field of high-energy physics
(HEP), in both its experimental and phenomenological studies, to incorporate
machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This
review paper provides a thorough illustration of these applications using
different ML and DL approaches. The first part of the paper examines the basics
of various particle physics types and establishes guidelines for assessing
particle physics alongside the available learning models. Next, a detailed
classification is provided for representing Jets that are reconstructed in
high-energy collisions, mainly in proton-proton collisions at well-defined beam
energies. This section covers various datasets, preprocessing techniques, and
feature extraction and selection methods. The presented techniques can be
applied to future hadron-hadron colliders (HHC), such as the high-luminosity
LHC (HL-LHC) and the future circular collider - hadron-hadron (FCChh). The
authors then explore several AI techniques analyses designed specifically for
both image and point-cloud (PC) data in HEP. Additionally, a closer look is
taken at the classification associated with Jet tagging in hadron collisions.
In this review, various state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in ML and DL are
examined, with a focus on their implications for HEP demands. More precisely,
this discussion addresses various applications in extensive detail, such as Jet
tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The review concludes
with an analysis of the current state of HEP using DL methodologies. It
highlights the challenges and potential areas for future research, which are
illustrated for each application.

Conclusion: 该框架增强了一致性和可预测性，是适用于多标准法律环境的通用且可解释的工具，有助于弥合规范解释和计算推理之间的差距，推动可审计法律AI发展。

Abstract: Applying complex legal rules characterized by multiple, heterogeneously
weighted criteria presents a fundamental challenge in judicial decision-making,
often hindering the consistent realization of legislative intent. This
challenge is particularly evident in the quantification of non-pecuniary
damages in personal injury cases. This paper introduces Soppia, a structured
prompting framework designed to assist legal professionals in navigating this
complexity. By leveraging advanced AI, the system ensures a comprehensive and
balanced analysis of all stipulated criteria, fulfilling the legislator's
intent that compensation be determined through a holistic assessment of each
case. Using the twelve criteria for non-pecuniary damages established in the
Brazilian CLT (Art. 223-G) as a case study, we demonstrate how Soppia (System
for Ordered Proportional and Pondered Intelligent Assessment) operationalizes
nuanced legal commands into a practical, replicable, and transparent
methodology. The framework enhances consistency and predictability while
providing a versatile and explainable tool adaptable across multi-criteria
legal contexts, bridging normative interpretation and computational reasoning
toward auditable legal AI.

Motivation: 研究委托方对代理方部分边际成本类型不知情时，代理方沟通以提高委托方认知的情况及对合约菜单的影响。

Method: 通过离散凹模型，采用可理性化程序，对类型的边际信念施加对数凹性、‘反向’贝叶斯主义和谨慎性假设。

Result: 委托方事前仅不知高成本类型时，高成本类型有动机提高其认知；三种类型时，初始已知的低成本类型也想提高其对高成本类型的认知；更多类型时，初始已知类型提高认知可能无利可图；事前仅不知低成本类型时，无类型会提高其认知。

Conclusion: 代理方提高委托方认知的动机受成本类型及数量影响。

Abstract: We analyze a principal-agent procurement problem in which the principal (she)
is unaware some of the marginal cost types of the agent (he). Communication
arises naturally as some types of the agent may have an incentive to raise the
principal's awareness (totally or partially) before a contract menu is offered.
The resulting menu must not only reflect the principal's change in awareness,
but also her learning about types from the agent's decision to raise her
awareness in the first place. We capture this reasoning in a discrete concave
model via a rationalizability procedure in which marginal beliefs over types
are restricted to log-concavity, ``reverse'' Bayesianism, and mild assumptions
of caution.
  We show that if the principal is ex ante only unaware of high-cost types, all
of these types have an incentive raise her awareness of them -- otherwise, they
would not be served. With three types, the two lower-cost types that the
principal is initially aware of also want to raise her awareness of the
high-cost type: Their quantities suffer no additional distortions and they both
earn an extra information rent. Intuitively, the presence of an even higher
cost type makes the original two look better. With more than three types, we
show that this intuition may break down for types of whom the principal is
initially aware of so that raising the principal's awareness could cease to be
profitable for those types. When the principal is ex ante only unaware of more
efficient (low-cost) types, then \textit{no type} raises her awareness, leaving
her none the wiser.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a principal who wishes to screen an agent with \emph{discrete}
types by offering a menu of \emph{discrete} quantities and \emph{discrete}
transfers. We assume that the principal's valuation is discrete strictly
concave and use a discrete first-order approach. We model the agent's cost
types as non-integer, with integer types as a limit case. Our modeling of cost
types allows us to replicate the typical constraint-simplification results and
thus to emulate the well-treaded steps of screening under a continuum of
contracts.
  We show that the solutions to the discrete F.O.C.s need not be unique
\textit{even under discrete strict concavity}, but we also show that there
cannot be more than two optimal contract quantities for each type, and that --
if there are two -- they must be adjacent. Moreover, we can only ensure weak
monotonicity of the quantities \textit{even if virtual costs are strictly
monotone}, unless we limit the ``degree of concavity'' of the principal's
utility. Our discrete screening approach facilitates the use of
rationalizability to solve the screening problem. We introduce a
rationalizability notion featuring robustness with respect to an open set of
beliefs over types called \textit{$\Delta$-O Rationalizability}, and show that
the set of $\Delta$-O rationalizable menus coincides with the set of usual
optimal contracts -- possibly augmented to include irrelevant contracts.

Conclusion: 该方法能将定量建模与3D空间规划相连接，为规划提供有效支持。

Abstract: The two-tier Lowry model brings dynamic simulations of population and
employment directly into the planning process. By linking regional modelling
with neighbourhood design, the framework enables planners to explore how
alternative planning scenarios may evolve over time. The upper tier captures
regional flows of people, jobs, and services, while the lower tier allocates
these to fine-grain zones such as neighbourhoods or parcels. Implemented in
CityEngine, the approach allows interactive visualisation and evaluation of
multi-scale scenarios. A case study in South Yorkshire (UK) illustrates how
regional forecasts can be translated into local design responses, connecting
quantitative modelling with 3D spatial planning.

Abstract: High-dimensional data that exhibit an intrinsic low-dimensional structure are
ubiquitous in machine learning and data science. While various approaches allow
for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing
downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds
presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework
for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our
approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this
setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield
constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down
under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz
continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian
descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic
and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our
approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably
efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings.
These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can
overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.

Abstract: This work addresses the finite-time analysis of nonsmooth nonconvex
stochastic optimization under Riemannian manifold constraints. We adapt the
notion of Goldstein stationarity to the Riemannian setting as a performance
metric for nonsmooth optimization on manifolds. We then propose a Riemannian
Online to NonConvex (RO2NC) algorithm, for which we establish the sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ in finding
$(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. This result is the first-ever
finite-time guarantee for fully nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization on manifolds
and matches the optimal complexity in the Euclidean setting. When gradient
information is unavailable, we develop a zeroth order version of RO2NC
algorithm (ZO-RO2NC), for which we establish the same sample complexity. The
numerical results support the theory and demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of the algorithms.

Conclusion: 工作为使信息检索评估与大语言模型消费者对齐迈出关键一步，能更可靠评估RAG组件。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses

(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

Motivation: 现有推理模型训练需大量计算和数据，运行慢且成本高，探索标准指令语言模型成为强大推理器的方法。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，结合CodeAct框架和少量样本的上下文学习。

Result: CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均优于对应推理模型，令牌效率提升10 - 81%，四个模型在六个任务上平均表现出色，代码增强的推理轨迹显示出多样的解题策略。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Result: 发现模型存在时代敏感性、浅层推理、上下文依赖推理失败三个关键局限。

Conclusion: 本文贡献的基准填补了现实长上下文评估的关键空白，能反映实际法律推理任务的复杂性和风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Result: 监督微调能提升模型性能，但仍有很大提升空间，最佳模型F1分数0.5648，Jaccard分数0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务复杂，CDrugRed是开发更强大准确药物推荐系统的有挑战性和有价值的资源，数据集公开。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

Motivation: SFT作为离策略方法，在有限数据场景易过拟合且泛化能力差，需改进。

Method: 提出Self - Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO，设计基于SFT模型和预训练模型对数策略比的奖励函数，实现无人工偏好注释的在线策略微调。

Result: 在一系列自然语言处理任务的实证评估中，Self - Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法。

Conclusion: Self - Rewarding PPO方法在利用演示数据对齐大语言模型方面有效，尤其在高质量标注数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

Conclusion: 解决不忠实检测基准中的标注歧义问题很重要，该领域未来有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Conclusion: 概述开放挑战和有前景的研究方向，为语言和图学习交叉领域的未来工作提供指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

Conclusion: 关联维度为大语言模型生成动力学提供新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型扩展上下文长度计算成本高，自注意力机制复杂度是瓶颈，现有块稀疏注意力方法依赖注意力模式，存在次优块级稀疏问题。

Method: 提出PBS - Attn方法，利用注意力的置换属性增加块级稀疏性，结合自定义的permuted - FlashAttention内核。

Result: 在真实长上下文数据集上，PBS - Attn在模型准确性上优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，接近全注意力基线，长上下文预填充端到端加速达2.75倍。

Conclusion: PBS - Attn方法有效提升大语言模型长上下文预填充的计算效率，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

Conclusion: 框架模块化，无需访问基础大语言模型梯度，可作为风险敏感模型部署中不确定性估计的即插即用增强方法。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

Conclusion: TripTide为基于LLM的旅行规划在现实不确定性下的适应性、个性化和恢复力评估建立了基准。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文介绍斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准SloPragEval和SloPragMega，对大语言模型进行评估，指出当前模型在理解细微语言和隐含意义方面存在不足，强调设计基准需谨慎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，需要超越表面语言能力的更具挑战性的评估，尤其是语用理解方面。

Method: 引入斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准SloPragEval和SloPragMega，包含405道选择题，讨论翻译困难，建立人类基线并对大语言模型进行试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在非字面表达尤其是特定文化表达中推断隐含意义时可能失败，专有模型和开源模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须谨慎设计，最好基于本土数据构建，并通过人类反馈验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Result: 首次在单一度量空间成功建模人类推理行为的普遍情况，捕捉推理特征、识别错误模式、表征个体差异。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和测量间建立定量桥梁，为推理架构提供机制性见解。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Motivation: 大语言模型推理能力多通过单轮强化学习培养，而实际应用多为多轮交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配问题，研究多轮人类反馈训练对推理任务的必要性。

Method: 将传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略进行比较。

Result: 单轮训练模型能有效泛化到单轮和多轮评估，多轮策略训练的模型单轮推理性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练更有效可靠，基本反馈的多轮训练益处有限，甚至会降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器训练易将目标属性与偶然属性纠缠，存在虚假关联问题，限制泛化和模型遵循输入文本提示的能力。

Method: 提出捷径重路由适配器训练，在训练时通过辅助模块（如ControlNet或LoRA）路由混杂因素，推理时移除辅助模块。

Result: 应用于面部和全身身份注入等任务时，提升了生成质量、多样性和对提示的遵循度。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解纠缠表示时，为不应学习的内容建立捷径可能是最有效的途径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成语义控制方法存在引入伪影、不可泛化等问题，需要统一、可泛化的语义控制方法。

Method: 引入VAP范式，将问题转化为上下文生成，利用参考视频作为语义提示，通过即插即用的Mixture - of - Transformers (MoT)专家引导冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT)，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验，构建VAP - Data数据集。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP为开源方法设定了新的最优水平，用户偏好率达38.7%，可与领先的特定条件商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着通用可控视频生成取得重大进展。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出用于医学图像分割的FM - BFF - Net，结合卷积和Transformer组件，实验显示其在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络在医学图像分割中难以捕捉全局上下文信息和长距离依赖，影响复杂边界和不同尺寸结构的分割精度，因此需新方法解决该问题。

Method: 提出FM - BFF - Net，结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制细化上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上的实验表明，FM - BFF - Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上始终超越近期的先进方法。

Conclusion: FM - BFF - Net能增强边界精度和对病变大小、形状及对比度变化的鲁棒性，对不同医学成像场景有效且具有适应性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 现有视觉 - 语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，现有3D数据集不支持这种“接地推理”能力，需解决此差距。

Method: 引入3DReasonKnee数据集，创建和验证该数据集花费专家大量时间；建立ReasonKnee - Bench评估定位和诊断准确性；对五个最先进的VLMs进行基准测试。

Result: 建立ReasonKnee - Bench并给出五个VLMs的基准性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee可作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的知识库，为推进多模态医学AI系统的3D、临床对齐、本地化决策能力提供重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Result: 在2个数据集上对3个视觉基础模型实验，VESSA在下游分类任务中比基础模型和先前适应方法有持续提升。

Conclusion: VESSA能有效让视觉基础模型在无标注情况下适应新领域，提升下游分类任务性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: 所提方法在城市尺度LiDAR目标级变化检测中有效且性能优越。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Conclusion: CT - CLIP在农业病害识别上能力强，可提升复杂环境下识别准确率，为农业自动病害识别提供创新实用方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Result: GranViT超越现有视觉编码器，对不同大语言模型有强迁移性，在多任务达SOTA。

Conclusion: GranViT有效解决现有视觉编码器细粒度感知问题，性能优异。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

Motivation: GRPO用于文本到图像生成存在优势归因不准确和忽略生成时间动态两个局限，需改进。

Method: 将优化范式从步骤级别转变为块级别，提出Chunk - GRPO，还引入可选加权采样策略。

Result: ChunkGRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量上取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 基于块级别的优化对基于GRPO的方法有前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的变化，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: 提出阶段感知蒸馏策略，用Gompertz曲线动态调整蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配，统一在多损失目标下。

Result: 在CIFAR - 10和CIFAR - 100上用不同师生架构实验，Gompertz - CNN分别比传统方法最高提高8%和4%的准确率。

Conclusion: Gompertz - CNN框架有效，优于传统知识蒸馏方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Conclusion: IMU+UWB的多人运动捕捉方法有前景。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境下的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.
