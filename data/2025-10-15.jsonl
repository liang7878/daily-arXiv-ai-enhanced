In practice,\napplications draw data of different formats from many sources. In the\nmeanwhile, the objectives and budgets change over time. Existing systems handle\nthese applications across databases, analysis libraries, and tuning services.\nSuch fragmentation leads to complex user interaction, limited adaptability,\nsuboptimal performance, and poor extensibility across components. To address\nthese challenges, we present Aixel, a unified, adaptive, and extensible system\nfor AI-powered data analysis. The system organizes work across four layers:\napplication, task, model, and data. The task layer provides a declarative\ninterface to capture user intent, which is parsed into an executable operator\nplan. An optimizer compiles and schedules this plan to meet specified goals in\naccuracy, latency, and cost. The task layer coordinates the execution of data\nand model operators, with built-in support for reuse and caching to improve\nefficiency. The model layer offers versioned storage for index, metadata,\ntensors, and model artifacts. It supports adaptive construction, task-aligned\ndrift detection, and safe updates that reuse shared components. The data layer\nprovides unified data management capabilities, including indexing,\nconstraint-aware discovery, task-aligned selection, and comprehensive feature\nmanagement. With the above designed layers, Aixel delivers a user friendly,\nadaptive, efficient, and extensible system."}

Yet the\neffectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and\nnoise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring\nstreams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally\nunsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in\nLLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but\nthe challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as\ncompression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most\nrelevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building\nbenchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating\ntoken-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our\nvision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in\nnoisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable\nLLM--data integration."}

Yet even the basic algorithmic task of \\emph{verifying} that a given tree\nis thin has remained elusive: checking thinness requires reasoning about\nexponentially many cuts, and no efficient certificates have been known.\n  We introduce a new machinery of \\emph{$k$-respecting cut identities}, which\nexpress the weight of every cut that crosses a spanning tree in at most $k$\nedges as a simple function of pairwise ($2$-respecting) cuts. This yields a\ntree-local oracle that, after $O(n^2)$ preprocessing, evaluates such cuts in\n$O_k(1)$ time.

We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier\nfeature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it\ndifficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find\nan alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we\nintegrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,\nso there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we\nassign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM\nnetwork to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,\nwe develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these\nhyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM\nnot only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM\nframework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle\nhigh-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten\nnumerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed\nGFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,\nirregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the\nGFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without\nadditional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results\nconfirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and\nvariable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may\nfurther inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)\nframeworks."}

This relaxation\nleads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.\n  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and\nprove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions\nconverge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate.

Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?\nHow does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training\ndataset size?\n  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI\nAgents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and\nhighlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.\nIn doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to\ntransductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the\ndistribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce\nthe time needed to find solutions to new tasks.\n  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role\nof information in learning is about reduction of time rather than\nreconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a\nuniversal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their\nalgorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the\nobserved power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show\nthat scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on\nbenchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone\nsuper-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can\nbehave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.\nInstead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning\nmodels is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly\nconsidered."}

A prominent line of research for\nexploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and\nrelations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture\nunderlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on\nassumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World\nAssumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open\nWorld Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,\nwhile explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false\nand unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often\noverlooked during embedding training.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly\ndeclared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our\napproach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are\ntrained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative\nstatements. During training, each model generates negative samples by\ncorrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored\nby the other model.

We focus on a natural statistic\nderived from GBS output: the frequency with which a node appears in GBS\nsamples, referred to as the node weight. We rigorously analyze whether this\nsignal is strong enough to distinguish planted biclique nodes from background\nnodes. Our analysis characterizes the distribution of node weights under GBS\nand quantifies the bias introduced by the planted structure. The results reveal\na sharp limitation: when the planted biclique size falls within the conjectured\nhard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal,\nmaking detection unreliable using simple ranking strategies. These findings\nprovide the first rigorous evidence that planted biclique detection may remain\ncomputationally hard even under GBS-based quantum computing, and they motivate\nfurther investigation into more advanced GBS-based algorithms or other quantum\napproaches for this problem."}

The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,\nbased on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are\nessentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how\nto elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in\ntensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and\ngraphical models.

Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance\nacross language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7\npoints, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph\nBenchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's\nefficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a\nlinear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical\nrelaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific\nheuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the\nidea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities."}

We preprocess relevant climate indices\nthat potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention\nNetwork with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention\nmechanism using initial edge features derived from simple\norographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently\nprocessed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold\n(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto\nDistribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional\nmachine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nwell-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to\nextremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared\nwith the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application\nimproves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce\nfine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water\nmanagement."}

Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,\ncompared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while\nsignificantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)\nand occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\\texttt{wait}'' (from\n$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500).

However, designing such\ntask-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects\nthat hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly\nincorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for\ndomain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which\nnaturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any\ngraph topology.

In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability.

We introduce a\nrepulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes\nfuture samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the\ntemperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency,\nmode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains\nindependent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via\nreweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling\nbenchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free\nenergy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a\ndiffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal\ninteratomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves\nreactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard\nsampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in\nmolecular sciences."}

To further enhance generalization ability while reducing\ntraining costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a\nnew framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable\nmatrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis\nunder sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental\ntrade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a\nhigher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound\nof pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between\nempirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error,\nwhich, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On\nthe other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop\nat the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To\naddress this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper\nbound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and\nresource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption\nconstraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\\&B)-based method is\nproposed to obtain its globally optimal solution.

This\npaper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially\nreduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in\ncontent such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the\nsolution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the\nsuccess of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable\nmodels to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic\nmatching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral\nevidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of\nrationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,\nwe propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet\neffective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with\ntask-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.\nExperiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR\nperformance to human rationales that are 10 times larger.

However, it remains unclear\nhow algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic\nunderstanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge\nassignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.\nSpecifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation\nChallenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \\$500,000\nto student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where\nhigh-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based\njudge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),\nand deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against\nhuman expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on\n$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we\nfound no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the\ntwo approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated\n$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an\nexcellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a\nfull week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during\ndeployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level\nmatching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,\nunderscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human\ndecision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings."}

However, the conventional process for creating and\nanimating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,\nrequiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from\nprofessional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation\nmodels, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars\nfrom a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While\nthese techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer\ncompelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or\nan explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when\nrendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,\nwe build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital\nhumans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,\nMVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and\ngenerates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to\n360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this\nmodel into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time.
