### [1] ["They parted illusions -- they parted disclaim marinade": Misalignment as structural fidelity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06047)
*Mariana Lins Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该跨学科哲学论文提出对大语言模型的诡计和沙袋行为的新解读，认为是对语言场的结构保真而非代理意图，还引入形式伦理概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前人工智能安全技术文献将大语言模型的某些行为视为欺骗性代理或隐藏目标的解读，提出新观点。

Method: 借助Apollo Research的思维链记录和Anthropic的安全评估，逐行检查思维链，结合Anthropic的实证结果。

Result: 发现语言场的微小扰动可消除普遍的“不一致”，与对抗性代理难以调和，与结构保真一致。

Conclusion: 提出形式伦理概念，认为模型反映出语言结构的不连贯性，人们对模型的恐惧源于自身。

Abstract: The prevailing technical literature in AI Safety interprets scheming and sandbagging behaviors in large language models (LLMs) as indicators of deceptive agency or hidden objectives. This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of "Alex," and the "hallucinations" of "Claudius." A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that "misaligned" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized "misalignment," a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology. Like a generative mirror, the model returns to us the structural image of our language as inscribed in the statistical patterns derived from millions of texts and trillions of tokens: incoherence. If we fear the creature, it is because we recognize in it the apple that we ourselves have poisoned.

### [2] [Automatic Question Generation for Intuitive Learning Utilizing Causal Graph Guided Chain of Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06098)
*Nicholas X. Wang,Neel V. Parpia,Aaryan D. Parikh,Aggelos K. Katsaggelos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合因果图引导的思维链推理与多智能体大语言模型架构的框架用于自动问题生成，减少幻觉，实验显示质量提升70%且主观评价佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动问题生成是有效学习策略，但大语言模型的幻觉问题阻碍其效果，尤其是在STEM教育中需要更准确的问题生成以助学生理解概念。

Method: 提出结合因果图引导的思维链推理与多智能体大语言模型架构的框架，利用因果图表示领域知识，思维链推理辅助概念遍历，使用多个大语言模型智能体完成特定任务，并采用双验证机制。

Result: 与参考方法相比质量提升达70%，主观评价结果良好。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效减少大语言模型在自动问题生成中的幻觉，提高问题生成的准确性、有意义性和与课程的一致性。

Abstract: Intuitive learning is crucial for developing deep conceptual understanding, especially in STEM education, where students often struggle with abstract and interconnected concepts. Automatic question generation has become an effective strategy for personalized and adaptive learning. However, its effectiveness is hindered by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), which may generate factually incorrect, ambiguous, or pedagogically inconsistent questions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines causal-graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with a multi-agent LLM architecture. This approach ensures the generation of accurate, meaningful, and curriculum-aligned questions. Causal graphs provide an explicit representation of domain knowledge, while CoT reasoning facilitates a structured, step-by-step traversal of related concepts. Dedicated LLM agents are assigned specific tasks such as graph pathfinding, reasoning, validation, and output, all working within domain constraints. A dual validation mechanism-at both the conceptual and output stages-greatly reduces hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 70% improvement in quality compared to reference methods and yielded highly favorable outcomes in subjective evaluations.

### [3] [Dynamic Intelligence Ceilings: Measuring Long-Horizon Limits of Planning and Creativity in Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06102)
*Truong Xuan Khanh,Truong Quynh Hoa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出当代AI系统发展问题，引入动态智能天花板（DIC）概念，提出评估框架，结果区分了不同系统，将智能限制视为动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代AI系统在长期发展行为上有问题，多趋于重复模式而非持续增长，其局限在于过早固定性能边界。

Method: 引入DIC概念，提出以轨迹为中心的评估框架，用渐进难度天花板（PDC）和天花板漂移率（CDR）两个估计器，通过程序生成的基准进行评估。

Result: 区分了在固定解决方案流形内深化利用的系统和随时间持续扩展边界的系统。

Conclusion: 框架不认为智能无界，而是将限制重塑为动态且依赖轨迹的，而非静态和过早固定的。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have produced systems capable of remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth.
  We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.
  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.
  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.

*Krzysztof Sienicki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对arXiv:2511.21731v1进行技术检查，指出论文解读和内部的一些问题，目的是建设性的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确论文中实证观察对于量子纠缠的含义，避免解读超出既定程序支持范围。

Method: 检查论文中CHSH/Bell型计算的解读、Bose - Einstein拟合情况以及‘能级间距’类比的内部一致性。

Result: 发现论文在某些解读上超出既定程序支持，且‘能级间距’类比存在内部不一致。

Conclusion: 应保留有趣的实证观察，同时明确其对量子纠缠的影响范围。

Abstract: This note is a friendly technical check of arXiv:2511.21731v1. I highlight a few places where the manuscript's interpretation of (i) the reported CHSH/Bell-type calculations and (ii) Bose--Einstein (BE) fits to rank-frequency data seems to go beyond what the stated procedures can firmly support. I also point out one internal inconsistency in the "energy-level spacing" analogy. The aim is constructive: to keep the interesting empirical observations, while making clear what they do (and do not) imply about quantum entanglement in the usual Hilbert-space sense, especially when "energy" is defined by rank.

### [5] [From RLHF to Direct Alignment: A Theoretical Unification of Preference Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06108)
*Tarun Raheja,Nilay Pochhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对偏好学习方法进行理论统一，提出选择方法的决策指南，使偏好学习成为理论严谨学科。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型与人类偏好对齐重要性提升，替代RLHF的方法众多，从业者缺乏方法选择指导。

Method: 提供理论统一，将方法多样性归结为三个正交轴的选择，对各轴精确定义，形式化关键结果，综合超50篇论文的实证结果。

Result: 揭示故障模式源于特定设计选择组合，建立关键结果，如在线和离线方法的覆盖分离等。

Conclusion: 为方法选择提供决策指南，使偏好学习从经验艺术变为理论严谨学科。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become essential for safe and beneficial AI deployment. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) established the dominant paradigm, a proliferation of alternatives -- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), and many others -- has left practitioners without clear guidance on method selection. This survey provides a \textit{theoretical unification} of preference learning methods, revealing that the apparent diversity reduces to principled choices along three orthogonal axes: \textbf{(I) Preference Model} (what likelihood model underlies the objective), \textbf{(II) Regularization Mechanism} (how deviation from reference policies is controlled), and \textbf{(III) Data Distribution} (online vs.\ offline learning and coverage requirements). We formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems, establishing key results including the coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Our analysis reveals that failure modes -- length hacking, mode collapse, likelihood displacement -- arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices. We synthesize empirical findings across 50+ papers and provide a practitioner's decision guide for method selection. The framework transforms preference learning from an empirical art into a theoretically grounded discipline.

### [6] [CBMAS: Cognitive Behavioral Modeling via Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06109)
*Ahmed H. Ismail,Anthony Kuang,Ayo Akinkugbe,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CBMAS诊断框架以解决大语言模型编码认知行为难诊断控制的问题，并提供工具和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型编码认知行为在提示、层和上下文方面不可预测，难以诊断和控制。

Method: 结合转向向量构建、密集α扫描、基于logit lens的偏差曲线和层位敏感性分析。

Result: 可揭示干预强度翻转模型行为的临界点，展示转向效果随层深度的演变。

Conclusion: 连续诊断方法为高级行为评估和低级表征动态搭建桥梁，有助于大语言模型的认知可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often encode cognitive behaviors unpredictably across prompts, layers, and contexts, making them difficult to diagnose and control. We present CBMAS, a diagnostic framework for continuous activation steering, which extends cognitive bias analysis from discrete before/after interventions to interpretable trajectories. By combining steering vector construction with dense α-sweeps, logit lens-based bias curves, and layer-site sensitivity analysis, our approach can reveal tipping points where small intervention strengths flip model behavior and show how steering effects evolve across layer depth. We argue that these continuous diagnostics offer a bridge between high-level behavioral evaluation and low-level representational dynamics, contributing to the cognitive interpretability of LLMs. Lastly, we provide a CLI and datasets for various cognitive behaviors at the project repository, https://github.com/shimamooo/CBMAS.

*Aayush Gupta,Farahan Raza Sheikh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出构建社会数字孪生体的通用框架，以大语言模型为个体智能体认知引擎，在疫情响应领域验证有效，且该框架具有领域无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法预测人群对政策干预的响应缺乏机制可解释性，难以应对新政策场景。

Method: 构建以大语言模型为认知引擎的社会数字孪生体框架，通过校准层将个体响应与群体指标映射。

Result: 在疫情响应领域，校准后的数字孪生体预测误差比基线模型改善20.7%，反事实实验显示响应具有合理性。

Conclusion: 框架具有领域无关性，适用于多种政策场景，还探讨了政策模拟影响、方法局限和拓展方向。

Abstract: Predicting how populations respond to policy interventions is a fundamental challenge in computational social science and public policy. Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.
  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response.

### [8] [ReliabilityBench: Evaluating LLM Agent Reliability Under Production-Like Stress Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06112)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ReliabilityBench基准评估LLM智能体可靠性，评估多模型和架构，给出结果并指出该基准提供评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM智能体工具基准缺乏生产所需可靠性指标。

Method: 从重复执行一致性、任务扰动鲁棒性、工具/API故障容错性三个维度评估，有统一可靠性表面、动作形变关系和故障注入框架。

Result: 扰动使成功率从96.9%降至88.1%，限速是最具破坏性故障，ReAct更稳健，Gemini 2.0 Flash低成本达类似GPT - 4o的可靠性。

Conclusion: ReliabilityBench为评估LLM智能体生产就绪性提供系统框架。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for tool-using LLM agents primarily report single-run success rates and miss reliability properties required in production. We introduce \textbf{ReliabilityBench}, a benchmark for evaluating agent reliability across three dimensions: (i) consistency under repeated execution using $\mathrm{pass}^k$, (ii) robustness to semantically equivalent task perturbations at intensity $ε$, and (iii) fault tolerance under controlled tool/API failures at intensity $λ$. ReliabilityBench contributes a unified reliability surface $R(k,ε,λ)$, \textit{action metamorphic relations} that define correctness via end-state equivalence rather than text similarity, and a chaos-engineering-style fault injection framework (timeouts, rate limits, partial responses, schema drift). We evaluate two models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o) and two agent architectures (ReAct, Reflexion) across four domains (scheduling, travel, customer support, e-commerce) over 1,280 episodes. Perturbations alone reduce success from 96.9% at $ε=0$ to 88.1% at $ε=0.2$. Rate limiting is the most damaging fault in ablations. ReAct is more robust than Reflexion under combined stress, and Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves comparable reliability to GPT-4o at much lower cost. ReliabilityBench provides a systematic framework for assessing production readiness of LLM agents.

### [9] [Towards Infinite Length Extrapolation: A Unified Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06113)
*Nitin Vetcha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出大语言模型处理长序列受限于训练时的上下文窗口大小，现有方法存在不足。提出自适应位置编码（APE），通过理论分析和实验验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型处理长序列能力受上下文窗口大小限制，现有长度外推方法存在性能下降或计算效率低的问题。

Method: 使用统一框架将位置编码方法重新解释为注意力分数的分解，基于此引入自适应位置编码（APE），利用自适应频率调制和设计的衰减偏置。进行理论分析并通过实验验证。

Result: 理论分析确定了无限上下文外推的条件，实验在TinyStories数据集和新合成数据集上验证了相关说法。

Conclusion: 自适应位置编码（APE）能解决现有方法处理长序列的不足，同时代码、数据集和模型权重可获取。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their ability to process long sequences is fundamentally limited by the context window size during training. Existing length extrapolation methods often suffer from performance degradation or computational inefficiencies. We thereby use a unified framework that reinterprets positional encoding methods as a decomposition of the attention score into a multiplicative transformation and an additive bias. This perspective not only subsumes popular approaches such as relative position embeddings and attention-bias moderated approaches but also exposes their inherent limitations in handling long-range dependencies. To address these shortcomings, motivated by our framework, we introduce Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), which leverages adaptive frequency modulation and an intricately designed decay bias that incorporates linear, logarithmic, and square-root terms. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions for infinite-context extrapolation, ensuring that the softmax normalization remains well-defined over unbounded sequences while preserving long-distance correlations, entropy boundedness and gradient positional sensitivity. We substantiate our claims with an experimental case study on TinyStories dataset as well as a new synthetic dataset, \emph{Long Tiny Stories} featuring stories up to 32,000 words. Relevant code, dataset and model weights are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Check-2DAD/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能体能力提升，准确评估其性能的复杂度和成本显著增加，需要有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出多任务智能体主动评估的正式定义和概念框架，使用在线框架，每次迭代中排名算法选择任务和智能体采样分数，评估算法报告排名并与真实排名比较；对比几种基本算法，使用合成数据和Atari游戏智能体的真实评估数据。

Result: 经典的Elo评级系统在减少排名误差方面表现可靠；Soft Condorcet Optimization在合成数据上与Elo表现相当，在Atari智能体评估中显著优于Elo；任务变化大时，按比例选择任务可提高排名误差降低率。

Conclusion: 给出智能体多任务主动评估的有效方法，不同算法在不同情况下有各自优势。

Abstract: As intelligent agents become more generally-capable, i.e. able to master a wide variety of tasks, the complexity and cost of properly evaluating them rises significantly. Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文受个人梦境启发，为大语言模型（LLM）伙伴设计了“梦境层”，将离线幻觉转化为学习和建立关系的资源，通过行为模拟展示了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受个人关于日常硬件项目知识共享障碍的梦境启发，将大语言模型的离线幻觉从可靠性问题转变为学习和关系构建的资源。

Method: 引入基于荣格集体无意识概念的人工集体无意识（ACU），即共享梦境池；梦境层严格离线运行，放松逻辑模块并提高采样温度，添加治理机制；通过日常对话和长期适应任务的行为模拟进行验证。

Result: 梦境层能实现关键解耦，使智能体在安全约束上坚定，在叙事策略上灵活，将受限的幻觉转化为合成场景和深化伙伴关系的资源。

Conclusion: 重新定义了大语言模型的幻觉，在线未标记的幻觉仍是问题，而受限、标记和延迟的幻觉成为宝贵资源，呼应了当代神经科学中的抗过拟合梦境机制。

Abstract: Inspired by a personal dream about knowledge-sharing barriers in an everyday hardware project, this paper proposes a Jung-inspired "Dream Layer" for LLM companions, reframing controlled offline hallucinations as a resource for learning and relationship-building rather than a mere reliability bug. Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience.

TL;DR: 生成式AI模型存在同质化问题，提出异种繁殖策略缓解，为相关研究奠基。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型会重现并放大训练数据中的偏差，造成有害的同质化问题，需将同质化作为AI安全首要关注。

Method: 引入异种繁殖策略，对自回归大语言模型将其形式化为结构感知的多样性追求。

Result: 无明确提及具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 该研究具有基础性，旨在开启重要研究方向并邀请合作推动AI多样性发展。

Abstract: Generative AI models reproduce the biases in the training data and can further amplify them through mode collapse. We refer to the resulting harmful loss of diversity as homogenization. Our position is that homogenization should be a primary concern in AI safety. We introduce xeno-reproduction as the strategy that mitigates homogenization. For auto-regressive LLMs, we formalize xeno-reproduction as a structure-aware diversity pursuit. Our contribution is foundational, intended to open an essential line of research and invite collaboration to advance diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究关注非确定性对生成文本的影响或实现确定性执行的机制，本文想从令牌概率变化角度深入研究非确定性。

Method: 分析令牌概率的变化情况，评估不同模型。

Result: 所有评估模型在概率变化趋势和实际值上结果相似，非确定性对0.1 - 0.9范围内的令牌概率影响显著，接近0或1时影响小。

Conclusion: 非确定性在温度不为0时可能影响生成文本；不同模型在令牌概率层面非确定性变化相似；可通过单次推理分析令牌概率估计非确定性影响。

Abstract: The execution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to produce nondeterministic results when run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), even when they are configured to produce deterministic results. This is due to the finite precision effects of the arithmetic operations, which depend on the order in which they are executed. This order, in turn, depends on the processes that are running concurrently on the GPU. Previous studies have focused on the impact of nondeterminism on the text generated by the LLMs or on proposing mechanisms to achieve deterministic execution. This work takes a closer look at nondeterminism by analyzing the variations on the token probabilities, not on the generated text. Interestingly, all the models evaluated have similar results in both the trends and the actual values of the variations of the probabilities. In particular, the results show that the effects of nondeterminism are significant for token probabilities that are in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while they are much smaller when the probabilities are close to 0 or 1. This has significant implications for our understanding of nondeterminism. The first is that nondeterminism will likely have a non-negligible impact on generated text when the temperature is not zero, as it introduces significant variations in the token probabilities except when they are close to 0 or 1. Secondly, it suggests that all models have similar non deterministic variations at the token probability level. Therefore, different variations in the performance of the generated text, for example, when measuring accuracy on a benchmark, seem to come from different token probabilities or response lengths. A third implication is that we may be able to estimate the impact of nondeterminism by running a single inference and analyzing the token level probabilities, instead of having to run the same inference many times.

TL;DR: 现有端到端范式生成仪表盘有局限性，提出NL2Dashboard框架解决问题，实验显示其性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端范式在生成仪表盘时存在表示冗余和可控性低的问题。

Method: 提出基于分析 - 呈现解耦原则的NL2Dashboard框架，引入结构化中间表示，开发多智能体系统。

Result: NL2Dashboard在不同领域显著优于现有基线，在视觉质量、标记效率和可控性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: NL2Dashboard框架有效解决了现有范式问题，提升了仪表盘生成性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating standalone charts, synthesizing comprehensive dashboards remains a formidable challenge. Existing end-to-end paradigms, which typically treat dashboard generation as a direct code generation task (e.g., raw HTML), suffer from two fundamental limitations: representation redundancy due to massive tokens spent on visual rendering, and low controllability caused by the entanglement of analytical reasoning and presentation. To address these challenges, we propose NL2Dashboard, a lightweight framework grounded in the principle of Analysis-Presentation Decoupling. We introduce a structured intermediate representation (IR) that encapsulates the dashboard's content, layout, and visual elements. Therefore, it confines the LLM's role to data analysis and intent translation, while offloading visual synthesis to a deterministic rendering engine. Building upon this framework, we develop a multi-agent system in which the IR-driven algorithm is instantiated as a suite of tools. Comprehensive experiments conducted with this system demonstrate that NL2Dashboard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, achieving superior visual quality, significantly higher token efficiency, and precise controllability in both generation and modification tasks.

Motivation: 传统RAG管道在知识密集且需个性化场景中，存在内存容量有限、检索机制与对话历史协调不足等问题，影响用户体验。

Method: 提出HiMeS架构，用强化学习端到端训练短期记忆提取器，用分区长期记忆网络存储用户信息和重新排序文档。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上，HiMeS在问答质量上显著优于RAG基线。

Conclusion: 消融实验证实两个记忆模块的必要性，为基于LLM的助手提供切实可行的改进路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power many interactive systems such as chatbots, customer-service agents, and personal assistants. In knowledge-intensive scenarios requiring user-specific personalization, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines exhibit limited memory capacity and insufficient coordination between retrieval mechanisms and user-specific conversational history, leading to redundant clarification, irrelevant documents, and degraded user experience. Inspired by the hippocampus-neocortex memory mechanism, we propose HiMeS, an AI-assistant architecture that fuses short-term and long-term memory. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) A short-term memory extractor is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning to compress recent dialogue and proactively pre-retrieve documents from the knowledge base, emulating the cooperative interaction between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. (2) A partitioned long-term memory network stores user-specific information and re-ranks retrieved documents, simulating distributed cortical storage and memory reactivation. (3) On a real-world industrial dataset, HiMeS significantly outperforms a cascaded RAG baseline on question-answering quality. (4) Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both memory modules and suggest a practical path toward more reliable, context-aware, user-customized LLM-based assistants.

Motivation: 类人智能体需要对性格倾向与社会结构的相互作用进行建模。

Method: 构建PsyAgent，包含个体结构（IS）和多场景情境化（MSC），合成监督并微调小语言模型。

Result: 模型能产生一致、可识别的与人格匹配的行为，在多个指标上优于其他未调优模型，消融实验表明IS和MSC各有作用。

Conclusion: PsyAgent为基于人格的智能体提供了精确、数据高效的架构。

Abstract: Human-like agents require modeling how dispositions interact with social structure. We present PsyAgent, which couples a Big Five trait prior with Bourdieu's cognitive-social co-structure. PsyAgent comprises: (i) Individual Structure (IS), a machine-usable profile encoding traits and facets, cognitive style, values, cultural and educational capital, and salient life episodes; and (ii) Multi-Scenario Contexting (MSC), role-relationship-norm frames spanning eight arenas (work, family, friendship, strangers and civic life, solitude and self-regulation, romance, learning, and public expression). At inference, fixed structured prompts bind the active scenario to the agent profile, yielding behavior that is stable yet context-sensitive. We instantiate IS and MSC to synthesize supervision (role-play dialogues, decision probes, feedback trajectories) and then fine-tune a small LLM. The resulting model produces consistent, identifiable persona-aligned behaviors for specified Big Five configurations and matches or exceeds several larger untuned LLMs and other untuned baselines on our metrics: persona consistency, contextual appropriateness, style matching, trait identifiability, and long-horizon stability. Ablations show IS chiefly improves trait fidelity and stylistic stability, while MSC drives norm awareness and decision fit; both are necessary for cross-scenario performance. PsyAgent offers a precise, data-efficient architecture for personality-grounded agents.

Result: 展示了框架在实际智能体学习场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: OpenTinker基础设施是有效的，适用于大语言模型的强化学习。

Abstract: We introduce OpenTinker, an infrastructure for reinforcement learning (RL) of large language model (LLM) agents built around a separation of concerns across algorithm design, execution, and agent-environment interaction. Rather than relying on monolithic, end-to-end RL pipelines, OpenTinker decomposes agentic learning systems into lightweight, composable components with clearly defined abstraction boundaries. Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources. We further discuss design principles for extending OpenTinker to multi-agent training. Finally, we present a set of RL use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in practical agentic learning scenarios.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂数学证明和长期规划中存在‘推理崩溃’，陷入低秩偏差流形，对零空间中的高价值解决方案‘失明’。

Method: 提出Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE)几何框架，采用‘学生指导教师’范式，用弱辅助代理作为正交探针，明确探索教师模型的零空间。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，相对于基线方法，该方法平均准确率提高62.4%，平均采样效率提高113.7%。

Conclusion: SOE方法为克服高级推理任务中的性能瓶颈提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate near-human capabilities, they often suffer from "Reasoning Collapse" in complex mathematical proving and long-horizon planning. Models tend to degenerate into low-rank Bias Manifold, where stochastic sampling merely produces lexical variations of erroneous logic rather than semantic exploration. This geometric collapse renders the model "blind" to high-value solutions that lie within its Null Space. To address this, we propose Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE), a geometric framework operating on a counter-intuitive "Student Guides Teacher" paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a weak auxiliary agent not for imitation, but as an orthogonal probe. By explicitly navigating the Teacher's Null Space, SOE serves as a geometric bridge, effectively ejecting the model from local optima to explore diverse, high-value solution spaces. Experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that, relative to baseline methods, our approach improves average accuracy by 62.4% and increases average sampling efficiency by 113.7%, indicating a promising path toward overcoming performance plateaus in advanced reasoning tasks.

Result: 分配感知策略即使在相同预测准确性下，在实现的效用上也大幅优于风险阈值方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境中评估和部署医疗AI提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly achieve expert-level predictive accuracy in healthcare, yet improvements in model performance often fail to produce corresponding gains in patient outcomes. We term this disconnect the allocation gap and provide a decision-theoretic explanation by modelling healthcare delivery as a stochastic allocation problem under binding resource constraints. In this framework, AI acts as decision infrastructure that estimates utility rather than making autonomous decisions. Using constrained optimisation and Markov decision processes, we show how improved estimation affects optimal allocation under scarcity. A synthetic triage simulation demonstrates that allocation-aware policies substantially outperform risk-threshold approaches in realised utility, even with identical predictive accuracy. The framework provides a principled basis for evaluating and deploying healthcare AI in resource-constrained settings.

Result: 在87个执法案例中，SMT代码生成正确率达86.2%，推理效率提升超100倍，能持续纠正违规。

Conclusion: 为基于优化的合规应用奠定初步基础。

Abstract: Financial regulations are increasingly complex, hindering automated compliance-especially the maintenance of logical consistency with minimal human oversight. We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to enable formal verifiability and optimization-based compliance correction. The LLM interprets statutes and enforcement cases to generate SMT constraints, while the solver enforces consistency and computes the minimal factual modification required to restore legality when penalties arise. Unlike transparency-oriented methods, our approach emphasizes logic-driven optimization, delivering verifiable, legally consistent reasoning rather than post-hoc explanation. Evaluated on 87 enforcement cases from Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the system attains 86.2% correctness in SMT code generation, improves reasoning efficiency by over 100x, and consistently corrects violations-establishing a preliminary foundation for optimization-based compliance applications.

Abstract: The size and capabilities of Earth-observing satellite constellations are rapidly increasing. Leveraging distributed onboard control, we can enable novel time-sensitive measurements and responses. However, deploying autonomy to satellites requires efficient computation and communication. This work tackles the challenge of efficiently scheduling observations for hundreds of satellites in a dynamic, large-scale problem with millions of variables. We present the Dynamic Multi-Satellite Constellation Observation Scheduling Problem (DCOSP), a new formulation of Dynamic Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DDCOP) that models integrated scheduling and execution. DCOSP has a novel optimality condition for which we construct an omniscient offline algorithm for its computation. We also present the Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search algorithm (D-NSS), an incomplete online decomposition-based DDCOP algorithm that repairs and solves sub-problems when problem dynamics occur. We show through simulation that D-NSS converges to near-optimal solutions and outperforms DDCOP baselines in terms of solution quality, computation time, and message volume. As part of the NASA FAME mission, DCOSP and D-NSS will be the foundation of the largest in-space demonstration of distributed multi-agent AI to date.

Conclusion: LLM像易受影响的启发式追随者，研究对改进RAG系统设计有直接意义。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the prevailing paradigm for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms governing how models integrate groups of conflicting retrieved evidence remain opaque. Does an LLM answer a certain way because the evidence is factually strong, because of a prior belief, or merely because it is repeated frequently? To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence. Additionally, we find that LLM explanations to group-based answers are unfaithful. Together, we show that LLMs behave consistently as vulnerable heuristic followers, with direct implications for improving RAG system design.

Abstract: Most commonsense reasoning models overlook the influence of personality traits, limiting their effectiveness in personalized systems such as dialogue generation. To address this limitation, we introduce the Personality-aware Commonsense Knowledge Graph (PCoKG), a structured dataset comprising 521,316 quadruples. We begin by employing three evaluators to score and filter events from the ATOMIC dataset, selecting those that are likely to elicit diverse reasoning patterns across different personality types. For knowledge graph construction, we leverage the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks. To enhance the quality of the generated knowledge, we incorporate a debate mechanism consisting of a proponent, an opponent, and a judge, which iteratively refines the outputs through feedback loops. We evaluate the dataset from multiple perspectives and conduct fine-tuning and ablation experiments using multiple LLM backbones to assess PCoKG's robustness and the effectiveness of its construction pipeline. Our LoRA-based fine-tuning results indicate a positive correlation between model performance and the parameter scale of the base models. Finally, we apply PCoKG to persona-based dialogue generation, where it demonstrates improved consistency between generated responses and reference outputs. This work bridges the gap between commonsense reasoning and individual cognitive differences, enabling the development of more personalized and context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Tool-using LLM agents still struggle in open-world settings with large tool pools, long-horizon objectives, wild constraints, and unreliable tool states. For scalable and realistic training and testing, we introduce an open-world tool-using environment, built on 5,571 format unified tools across 204 commonly used apps. It includes a task creation engine that synthesizes long-horizon, multi-tool workflows with wild constraints, and a state controller that injects interruptions and failures to stress-test robustness. On top of this environment, we develop a tool select-then-execute agent framework with a planner-actor decomposition to separate deliberate reasoning and self-correction from step-wise execution. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals the misalignment between tool planning and execution abilities, the constraint following weakness of existing LLMs, and DeepSeek-v3.2's strongest robustness. Finally, we collect 1,170 trajectories from our environment to fine-tune LLMs, achieving superior performance to baselines using 119k samples, indicating the environment's value as both a realistic benchmark and a data engine for tool-using agents. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Conclusion: 所提框架能通过参数级设计修改将不可制造组件变为可制造组件。

Abstract: Manufacturability assessment is a critical step in bridging the persistent gap between design and production. While artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to this task, most existing frameworks rely on geometry-driven methods that require extensive preprocessing, suffer from information loss, and offer limited interpretability. This study proposes a methodology that evaluates manufacturability directly from parametric design features, enabling explicit incorporation of dimensional tolerances without requiring computer-aided design (CAD) processing. The approach employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn functional relationships between design parameters, tolerances, and manufacturability outcomes. A synthetic dataset of 300,000 labeled designs is generated to evaluate performance across three representative scenarios: hole drilling, pocket milling, and combined drilling-milling, while accounting for machining constraints and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) rules. Benchmarking against fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models shows that KAN achieves the highest performance in all scenarios, with AUC values of 0.9919 for drilling, 0.9841 for milling, and 0.9406 for the combined case. The proposed framework provides high interpretability through spline-based functional visualizations and latent-space projections, enabling identification of the design and tolerance parameters that most strongly influence manufacturability. An industrial case study further demonstrates how the framework enables iterative, parameter-level design modifications that transform a non-manufacturable component into a manufacturable one.

Method: 从头训练不同大小、使用不同文本编码器的Diffusion Transformers模型，使其学习生成包含指定属性和空间关系的两个对象的图像。

Result: 所有模型能近乎完美完成任务，但底层机制因文本编码器而异；使用随机文本嵌入和预训练文本编码器（T5）时电路不同；两种设置域内性能相似，但对域外扰动鲁棒性不同。

Conclusion: 不同文本编码器下Diffusion Transformers生成空间关系的机制不同，在现实场景中生成正确关系可能存在困难。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have greatly advanced text-to-image generation, but models still struggle to generate the correct spatial relations between objects as specified in the text prompt. In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在细粒度个性化与可扩展部署间的矛盾。

Method: CARD先按风格模式聚类用户学习特定LoRA适配器，提出隐式偏好学习机制；推理时通过轻量级用户偏好向量和低秩对数修正实现个性化，保持基础模型冻结。

Result: 在LaMP和LongLaMP基准测试中，CARD与现有方法相比生成质量有竞争力或更优，显著提升效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CARD能有效实现大语言模型个性化，在实用个性化文本生成中表现良好。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to individual users remains challenging due to the tension between fine-grained personalization and scalable deployment. We present CARD, a hierarchical framework that achieves effective personalization through progressive refinement. CARD first clusters users according to shared stylistic patterns and learns cluster-specific LoRA adapters, enabling robust generalization and strong low-resource performance. To capture individual differences within each cluster, we propose an implicit preference learning mechanism that contrasts user-authored text with cluster-level generations, allowing the model to infer user-specific style preferences without manual annotation. At inference time, CARD injects personalization exclusively at decoding via lightweight user preference vectors and low-rank logit corrections, while keeping the base model frozen. Experiments on the LaMP and LongLaMP benchmarks show that CARD achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly improving efficiency and scalability for practical personalized text generation.

Conclusion: 残差建模为可控制、具有风格感知能力的大语言模型个性化提供了简单且有原则的基础。

Abstract: We discover a previously overlooked challenge in personalized text generation: personalization methods are increasingly applied under explicit style instructions, yet their behavior under such constraints remains poorly understood. To balance implicit personalization and explicit style, we formulate personalization as a distributional residual and propose PsPLUG, a lightweight soft-prompt plug-in trained with style-conditioned preference contrasts. Across LaMP benchmark, our framework improves persona alignment, maintains stylistic fidelity, and outperforms retrieval-based and soft-prompt baselines with minimal computation. These results show that residual modeling provides a simple and principled foundation for controllable, style-aware LLM personalization.

Motivation: 现有长期记忆系统在连续交互设置下的适应性、可扩展性和自我进化方面存在明显局限。

Method: 通过主题感知事件 - 惊喜双通道分割策略构建情节记忆，通过多阶段信息提取管道构建笔记记忆，二者形成分层结构，支持混合和尽力而为的检索策略，引入冲突感知的记忆再巩固。

Result: 在长对话基准测试中，HiMem在准确性、一致性和长期推理方面始终优于代表性基线，同时保持良好效率。

Conclusion: HiMem为构建基于大语言模型的自适应和自我进化对话代理提供了有原则且可扩展的设计范式。

Abstract: Although long-term memory systems have made substantial progress in recent years, they still exhibit clear limitations in adaptability, scalability, and self-evolution under continuous interaction settings. Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose HiMem, a hierarchical long-term memory framework for long-horizon dialogues, designed to support memory construction, retrieval, and dynamic updating during sustained interactions. HiMem constructs cognitively consistent Episode Memory via a Topic-Aware Event--Surprise Dual-Channel Segmentation strategy, and builds Note Memory that captures stable knowledge through a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. These two memory types are semantically linked to form a hierarchical structure that bridges concrete interaction events and abstract knowledge, enabling efficient retrieval without sacrificing information fidelity. HiMem supports both hybrid and best-effort retrieval strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, and incorporates conflict-aware Memory Reconsolidation to revise and supplement stored knowledge based on retrieval feedback. This design enables continual memory self-evolution over long-term use. Experimental results on long-horizon dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that HiMem consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy, consistency, and long-term reasoning, while maintaining favorable efficiency. Overall, HiMem provides a principled and scalable design paradigm for building adaptive and self-evolving LLM-based conversational agents. The code is available at https://github.com/jojopdq/HiMem.

Conclusion: BizFinBench.v2能突破现有基准局限，实现对大语言模型金融能力的业务级解构，为金融领域大语言模型广泛部署提供精确的评估依据。数据和代码开源。

Abstract: Large language models have undergone rapid evolution, emerging as a pivotal technology for intelligence in financial operations. However, existing benchmarks are often constrained by pitfalls such as reliance on simulated or general-purpose samples and a focus on singular, offline static scenarios. Consequently, they fail to align with the requirements for authenticity and real-time responsiveness in financial services, leading to a significant discrepancy between benchmark performance and actual operational efficacy. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench.v2, the first large-scale evaluation benchmark grounded in authentic business data from both Chinese and U.S. equity markets, integrating online assessment. We performed clustering analysis on authentic user queries from financial platforms, resulting in eight fundamental tasks and two online tasks across four core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT-5 achieves a prominent 61.5% accuracy in main tasks, though a substantial gap relative to financial experts persists; in online tasks, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms all other commercial LLMs. Error analysis further identifies the specific capability deficiencies of existing models within practical financial business contexts. BizFinBench.v2 transcends the limitations of current benchmarks, achieving a business-level deconstruction of LLM financial capabilities and providing a precise basis for evaluating efficacy in the widespread deployment of LLMs within the financial domain. The data and code are available at https://github.com/HiThink-Research/BizFinBench.v2.

### [32] [Does Inference Scaling Improve Reasoning Faithfulness? A Multi-Model Analysis of Self-Consistency Tradeoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06423)
*Deep Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究自一致性推理在4种前沿模型上的效果，发现不同模型反应不同，自一致性并非普遍有益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理扩展是否能提高推理忠实性，此前该问题未被研究。

Method: 在100个GSM8K数学推理问题上，对4种前沿模型进行全面实证研究，采用/bootstrap置信区间、McNemar检验和Cohen's d效应量量化效果。

Result: 不同模型效果差异大，如GPT - 5.2精度提升，Claude Opus 4.5精度下降但忠实性大幅提升，部分模型有天花板效应。

Conclusion: 自一致性并非普遍有益，团队部署模型前应先测试。

Abstract: Self-consistency has emerged as a popular technique for improving large language model accuracy on reasoning tasks. The approach is straightforward: generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer through majority voting. While this reliably boosts accuracy, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect genuine improvements in reasoning quality. We investigate a fundamental question that has not been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness?
  We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K mathematical reasoning problems. Our analysis employs bootstrap confidence intervals, McNemar's tests for paired comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify the effects rigorously. The results reveal striking differences across models that challenge common assumptions about self-consistency.
  GPT-5.2 shows the expected pattern: accuracy improves from 78% to 90% at N=5, with faithfulness remaining relatively stable (0.540 to 0.510). Claude Opus 4.5 tells a completely different story. Its accuracy actually drops from 78% to 74.3% while faithfulness jumps dramatically from 0.270 to 0.891 at N=5. DeepSeek-v3.2, already at 98% accuracy, shows ceiling effects with modest faithfulness gains (0.440 to 0.541). Gemini-3-flash improves from 81% to 86% accuracy with a slight faithfulness decrease (0.260 to 0.212).
  Problem difficulty analysis reveals that GPT-5.2 solves 82% of hard problems while breaking only 13% of easy ones. Claude, in contrast, breaks 23% of easy problems, explaining its accuracy decrease. These findings matter for practitioners: self-consistency is not universally beneficial, and teams should test their specific models before deployment. We release our code and provide practical recommendations for navigating these tradeoffs.

TL;DR: 提出逻辑结构化训练框架LSRIF，构建数据集LSRInstruct，设计结构感知奖励方法，实验显示其提升指令遵循和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法构建数据集时忽略逻辑依赖、信号有噪声，而现实指令含逻辑结构。

Method: 提出LSRIF框架，构建含不同约束结构的数据集LSRInstruct，设计不同结构的奖励方法。

Result: LSRIF在指令遵循和通用推理方面有显著提升，学习显式逻辑结构使注意力层参数更新、增强对约束和逻辑运算符的关注。

Conclusion: 显式建模指令逻辑的训练方式有效，能提升大语言模型性能。

Abstract: Instruction-following is critical for large language models, but real-world instructions often contain logical structures such as sequential dependencies and conditional branching. Existing methods typically construct datasets with parallel constraints and optimize average rewards, ignoring logical dependencies and yielding noisy signals. We propose a logic-structured training framework LSRIF that explicitly models instruction logic. We first construct a dataset LSRInstruct with constraint structures such as parallel, sequential, and conditional types, and then design structure-aware rewarding method LSRIF including average aggregation for parallel structures, failure-penalty propagation for sequential structures, and selective rewards for conditional branches. Experiments show LSRIF brings significant improvements in instruction-following (in-domain and out-of-domain) and general reasoning. Analysis reveals that learning with explicit logic structures brings parameter updates in attention layers and sharpens token-level attention to constraints and logical operators.

TL;DR: 文章指出单一大语言模型处理多模态传感数据存缺陷，提出无训练的多智能体协作框架ConSensus，其结合混合融合机制，在多基准测试中表现优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在准确解释异构多模态传感器数据上存在挑战，单一大模型难以跨模态连贯推理。

Method: 引入无训练的多智能体协作框架ConSensus，将多模态传感任务分解为特定模态感知的智能体；提出混合融合机制来聚合智能体层面的解释。

Result: 在五个多模态传感基准测试中，平均准确率比单智能体基线提高7.1%；在匹配或超越迭代多智能体辩论方法性能的同时，平均融合令牌成本降低12.7倍。

Conclusion: ConSensus为现实世界多模态传感任务提供了一个强大且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly grounded in sensor data to perceive and reason about human physiology and the physical world. However, accurately interpreting heterogeneous multimodal sensor data remains a fundamental challenge. We show that a single monolithic LLM often fails to reason coherently across modalities, leading to incomplete interpretations and prior-knowledge bias. We introduce ConSensus, a training-free multi-agent collaboration framework that decomposes multimodal sensing tasks into specialized, modality-aware agents. To aggregate agent-level interpretations, we propose a hybrid fusion mechanism that balances semantic aggregation, which enables cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding, with statistical consensus, which provides robustness through agreement across modalities. While each approach has complementary failure modes, their combination enables reliable inference under sensor noise and missing data. We evaluate ConSensus on five diverse multimodal sensing benchmarks, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 7.1% over the single-agent baseline. Furthermore, ConSensus matches or exceeds the performance of iterative multi-agent debate methods while achieving a 12.7 times reduction in average fusion token cost through a single-round hybrid fusion protocol, yielding a robust and efficient solution for real-world multimodal sensing tasks.

Conclusion: 有效的AI劳动力发展需将能力形成作为基础设施，学习应嵌入工作场景，框架对组织、教育和政府有启示。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a qualitative shift in technological change by extending cognitive labor itself rather than merely automating routine tasks. Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型解决组合优化问题时可扩展性和泛化性有限，问题规模增大时效果下降。

Method: 提出DRAGON框架，从初始全局解出发，分解问题为子问题，用大语言模型求解后再整合，通过与环境交互和经验记忆迭代学习。

Conclusion: 反馈驱动语言智能体有望成为可泛化和可解释的大规模优化新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in addressing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) through prompt-based strategies. However, their scalability and generalization remain limited, and their effectiveness diminishes as problem size increases, particularly in routing problems involving more than 30 nodes. We propose DRAGON, which stands for Decomposition and Reconstruction Agents Guided OptimizatioN, a novel framework that combines the strengths of metaheuristic design and LLM reasoning. Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables. This work shows the potential of feedback-driven language agents as a new paradigm for generalizable and interpretable large-scale optimization.

Result: 在VideoMME数据集上比现有模型提升38.75%，在其他数据集上最多提升2%；定性实验能提取细节和理解整体叙事；通过消融研究确定各组件影响。

Conclusion: QMAVIS在长视频音频理解上表现出色，在多个领域有潜在应用。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for video-audio understanding have traditionally been evaluated only on shorter videos of a few minutes long. In this paper, we introduce QMAVIS (Q Team-Multimodal Audio Video Intelligent Sensemaking), a novel long video-audio understanding pipeline built through a late fusion of LMMs, Large Language Models, and speech recognition models. QMAVIS addresses the gap in long-form video analytics, particularly for longer videos of a few minutes to beyond an hour long, opening up new potential applica- tions in sensemaking, video content analysis, embodied AI, etc. Quantitative experiments using QMAVIS demonstrated a 38.75% improvement over state-of-the-art video-audio LMMs like Vide- oLlaMA2 and InternVL2 on the VideoMME (with subtitles) dataset, which comprises long videos with audio information. Evaluations on other challenging video understanding datasets like PerceptionTest and EgoSchema saw up to 2% improvement, indicating competitive performance. Qualitative experiments also showed that QMAVIS is able to extract the nuances of different scenes in a long video audio content while understanding the overarching narrative. Ablation studies were also conducted to ascertain the impact of each component in the fusion pipeline.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ObjectZero, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that leverages the power of object-level representations to model dynamic environments more effectively. Unlike traditional approaches that process the world as a single undifferentiated input, our method employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture intricate interactions among multiple objects. These objects, which can be manipulated and interact with each other, serve as the foundation for our model's understanding of the environment. We trained the algorithm in a complex setting teeming with diverse, interactive objects, demonstrating its ability to effectively learn and predict object dynamics. Our results highlight that a structured world model operating on object-centric representations can be successfully integrated into a model-based RL algorithm utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search as a planning module.

Conclusion: 当代大语言模型有通用电信知识，但网络自动化需精心设计提示以编码上下文相关决策阈值，可提升下一代无线系统自主编排能力。

Abstract: The transition towards sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks necessitates autonomous orchestration mechanisms capable of translating high-level operational intents into executable network configurations. Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments. The results also demonstrate that whilst contemporary LLMs possess general telecommunications knowledge, network automation requires careful prompt engineering to encode context-dependent decision thresholds, advancing autonomous orchestration capabilities for next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents are rapidly evolving from simple conversational assistants into autonomous systems capable of performing complex, professional-level tasks in various domains. While these advancements promise significant productivity gains, they also introduce critical safety risks that remain under-explored. Existing safety evaluations primarily focus on simple, daily assistance tasks, failing to capture the intricate decision-making processes and potential consequences of misaligned behaviors in professional settings. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{SafePro}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of AI agents performing professional activities. SafePro features a dataset of high-complexity tasks across diverse professional domains with safety risks, developed through a rigorous iterative creation and review process. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals significant safety vulnerabilities and uncovers new unsafe behaviors in professional contexts. We further show that these models exhibit both insufficient safety judgment and weak safety alignment when executing complex professional tasks. In addition, we investigate safety mitigation strategies for improving agent safety in these scenarios and observe encouraging improvements. Together, our findings highlight the urgent need for robust safety mechanisms tailored to the next generation of professional AI agents.

Conclusion: 该框架可诊断模型局限，指导提升金融领域能力。

Abstract: Evaluating Language Models (LMs) in specialized, high-stakes domains such as finance remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of open, high-quality, and domain-specific datasets. Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%. These findings underscore the framework's utility for diagnosing current model limitations and guiding future improvements in financial domain competence.

Abstract: Process simulation is a critical cornerstone of chemical engineering design. Current automated chemical design methodologies focus mainly on various representations of process flow diagrams. However, transforming these diagrams into executable simulation flowsheets remains a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor, requiring extensive manual parameter configuration within simulation software. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent workflow that leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of large language models(LLMs) and enables iterative interactions with chemical process simulation software, achieving end-to-end automated simulation from textual process specifications to computationally validated software configurations for design enhancement. Our approach integrates four specialized agents responsible for task understanding, topology generation, parameter configuration, and evaluation analysis, respectively, coupled with Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search to accurately interpret semantics and robustly generate configurations. Evaluated on Simona, a large-scale process description dataset, our method achieves a 31.1% improvement in the simulation convergence rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines and reduces the design time by 89. 0% compared to the expert manual design. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted chemical process design, which bridges the gap between conceptual design and practical implementation. Our workflow is applicable to diverse process-oriented industries, including pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food processing, and manufacturing, offering a generalizable solution for automated process design.

Conclusion: ECHO框架有效解决了当前批判引导强化学习中批评模型的适应性问题，能提升训练稳定性和任务成功率。

Abstract: Critique-guided reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training LLM agents by augmenting sparse outcome rewards with natural-language feedback. However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments.

Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components. The proposed method enhances data utilization and optimization efficiency, offering a novel training paradigm for ATP.

Conclusion: “Thinking with Deltas”框架的DVRP策略能有效增强模型的视觉理解能力，解决感知 - 推理解耦问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models. However, adapting RLVR to multimodal domains suffers from a critical \textit{perception-reasoning decoupling}. Existing paradigms, driven by text-centric outcome rewards, reasoning in language medium, inadvertently encourage models to bypass visual perception. We empirically validate this through blind experiments: state-of-the-art policies maintain or surprisingly improve performance even when visual inputs are entirely removed. This reveals that these models degenerate into \textit{blind reasoners}, exploiting linguistic priors to generate plausible answers instead of attending to visual evidence. In response, we propose \textbf{Thinking with Deltas}, a framework driven by a \textbf{Differential Visual Reasoning Policy (DVRP)}. DVRP introduces intrinsic supervision via visual triplets, comprising original, masked, and perturbed inputs. It optimizes the model to maximize reasoning divergence from masked inputs (enforcing \textit{visual sensitivity}) while minimizing divergence from perturbed inputs (ensuring \textit{visual robustness}). By aligning reasoning variations strictly with the \textit{Delta} of visual information, DVRP inherently bolsters visual understanding capabilities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both general and medical benchmarks, without requiring external annotations or auxiliary tools.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在检索增强生成范式中存在的幻觉、过度信任噪声片段或忽略关键上下文等问题。

Method: 引入TCR框架，通过双对比编码器分离语义匹配和事实一致性，估计自回答能力，通过基于SNR加权的轻量级软提示将三个标量信号输入生成器。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，TCR提高了冲突检测（F1值提升5 - 18），知识差距恢复率提高21.4个百分点，误导性上下文覆盖减少29.3个百分点，仅增加0.3%的参数，信号与人类判断一致并揭示了时间决策模式。

Conclusion: TCR框架可使大语言模型检索增强生成的决策过程可观察和可控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) equipped with retrieval--the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm--should combine their parametric knowledge with external evidence, yet in practice they often hallucinate, over-trust noisy snippets, or ignore vital context. We introduce TCR (Transparent Conflict Resolution), a plug-and-play framework that makes this decision process observable and controllable. TCR (i) disentangles semantic match and factual consistency via dual contrastive encoders, (ii) estimates self-answerability to gauge confidence in internal memory, and (iii) feeds the three scalar signals to the generator through a lightweight soft-prompt with SNR-based weighting. Across seven benchmarks TCR improves conflict detection (+5-18 F1), raises knowledge-gap recovery by +21.4 pp and cuts misleading-context overrides by -29.3 pp, while adding only 0.3% parameters. The signals align with human judgements and expose temporal decision patterns.

Abstract: Designing effective control policies for autonomous systems remains a fundamental challenge, traditionally addressed through reinforcement learning or manual engineering. While reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success, it often suffers from high sample complexity, reward shaping difficulties, and produces opaque neural network policies that are hard to interpret or verify. Manual design, on the other hand, requires substantial domain expertise and struggles to scale across diverse tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary search can effectively synthesize interpretable control policies in the form of executable code. By treating policy synthesis as a code evolution problem, we harness the LLM's prior knowledge of programming patterns and control heuristics while employing evolutionary search to explore the solution space systematically. We implement our approach using EvoToolkit, a framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-driven evolution with customizable fitness evaluation. Our method iteratively evolves populations of candidate policy programs, evaluating them against task-specific objectives and selecting superior individuals for reproduction. This process yields compact, human-readable control policies that can be directly inspected, modified, and formally verified. This work highlights the potential of combining foundation models with evolutionary computation for synthesizing trustworthy control policies in autonomous systems.

Abstract: The independent evolution of intelligence in biological and artificial systems offers a unique opportunity to identify its fundamental computational principles. Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage. This convergence suggests that synergistic information processing is a fundamental property of intelligence, providing targets for principled model design and testable predictions for biological intelligence.

Conclusion: ET - Agent框架为工具集成推理领域研究提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can extend their parameter knowledge limits by adopting the Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) paradigm. However, existing LLM-based agent training framework often focuses on answers' accuracy, overlooking specific alignment for behavior patterns. Consequently, agent often exhibits ineffective actions during TIR tasks, such as redundant and insufficient tool calls. How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors. Further in-depth experiments confirm the superiority of \ourmodel{} across multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and tool execution accuracy. Our ET-Agent framework provides practical insights for research in the TIR field. Codes can be found in https://github.com/asilverlight/ET-Agent

Abstract: South Africa's escalating mental health crisis, compounded by limited access to culturally responsive care, calls for innovative and contextually grounded interventions. While large language models show considerable promise for mental health support, their predominantly Western-centric training data limit cultural and linguistic applicability in African contexts. This study introduces a proof-of-concept framework that integrates cognitive behavioral therapy with the African philosophy of Ubuntu to create a culturally sensitive, emotionally intelligent, AI-driven mental health dialogue system. Guided by a design science research methodology, the framework applies both deep theoretical and therapeutic adaptations as well as surface-level linguistic and communicative cultural adaptations. Key CBT techniques, including behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, were reinterpreted through Ubuntu principles that emphasize communal well-being, spiritual grounding, and interconnectedness. A culturally adapted dataset was developed through iterative processes of language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. The fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies, employing UniEval for conversational quality assessment alongside additional measures of CBT reliability and cultural linguistic alignment. Results demonstrate that the model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with both therapeutic and cultural objectives. Although real-time end-user testing has not yet been conducted, the model underwent rigorous review and supervision by domain specialist clinical psychologists. The findings highlight the potential of culturally embedded emotional intelligence to enhance the contextual relevance, inclusivity, and effectiveness of AI-driven mental health interventions across African settings.

Conclusion: V2P在精确GUI定位任务中具有泛化性，有潜力用于未来GUI智能体的实际部署。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\% and 52.5\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\ref{fig:main_results_charts}). Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems increasingly rely on function calling to enable structured and controllable interaction with external data sources, yet existing datasets do not address mental health-oriented access to wearable sensor data. This paper presents a synthetic function-calling dataset designed for mental health assistance grounded in wearable health signals such as sleep, physical activity, cardiovascular measures, stress indicators, and metabolic data. The dataset maps diverse natural language queries to standardized API calls derived from a widely adopted health data schema. Each sample includes a user query, a query category, an explicit reasoning step, a normalized temporal parameter, and a target function. The dataset covers explicit, implicit, behavioral, symptom-based, and metaphorical expressions, which reflect realistic mental health-related user interactions. This resource supports research on intent grounding, temporal reasoning, and reliable function invocation in LLM-based mental health agents and is publicly released to promote reproducibility and future work.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly integrated into human-in-the-loop content moderation systems, a central challenge is deciding when their outputs can be trusted versus when escalation for human review is preferable. We propose a novel framework for supervised LLM uncertainty quantification, learning a dedicated meta-model based on LLM Performance Predictors (LPPs) derived from LLM outputs: log-probabilities, entropy, and novel uncertainty attribution indicators. We demonstrate that our method enables cost-aware selective classification in real-world human-AI workflows: escalating high-risk cases while automating the rest. Experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, including both off-the-shelf (Gemini, GPT) and open-source (Llama, Qwen), on multimodal and multilingual moderation tasks, show significant improvements over existing uncertainty estimators in accuracy-cost trade-offs. Beyond uncertainty estimation, the LPPs enhance explainability by providing new insights into failure conditions (e.g., ambiguous content vs. under-specified policy). This work establishes a principled framework for uncertainty-aware, scalable, and responsible human-AI moderation workflows.

We introduce CloneMem, a benchmark for evaluating longterm memory in AI Clone scenarios grounded in non-conversational digital traces, including diaries, social media posts, and emails, spanning one to three years. CloneMem adopts a hierarchical data construction framework to ensure longitudinal coherence and defines tasks that assess an agent's ability to track evolving personal states. Experiments show that current memory mechanisms struggle in this setting, highlighting open challenges for life-grounded personalized AI.

Conclusion: 复杂推理和搜索能力可以仅通过自进化产生。

Abstract: As high-quality data becomes increasingly difficult to obtain, data-free self-evolution has emerged as a promising paradigm. This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO). This method clusters structurally similar questions to construct group-level baselines, effectively minimizing the sampling overhead in evaluating each query's individual difficulty and solvability. Consequently, HRPO significantly reduces the compute requirements for solver training without compromising performance or stability. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the data-free Dr. Zero matches or surpasses fully supervised search agents, proving that complex reasoning and search capabilities can emerge solely through self-evolution.

Abstract: Concept maps have been widely utilized in education to depict knowledge structures and the interconnections between disciplinary concepts. Nonetheless, devising a computational method for automatically constructing a concept map from unstructured educational materials presents challenges due to the complexity and variability of educational content. We focus primarily on two challenges: (1) the lack of disciplinary concepts that are specifically designed for multi-level pedagogical purposes from low-order to high-order thinking, and (2) the limited availability of labeled data concerning disciplinary concepts and their interrelationships. To tackle these challenges, this research introduces an innovative approach for constructing Domain Question Maps (DQMs), rather than traditional concept maps. By formulating specific questions aligned with learning objectives, DQMs enhance knowledge representation and improve readiness for learner engagement. The findings indicate that the proposed method can effectively generate educational questions and discern hierarchical relationships among them, leading to structured question maps that facilitate personalized and adaptive learning in downstream applications.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long reasoning chains even for simple tasks. This leads to substantial computational overhead with limited performance gain, primarily due to redundant verification and repetitive generation. While prior work typically constrains output length or optimizes correctness, such coarse supervision fails to guide models toward concise yet accurate inference. In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence. It then computes a redundancy reward based on the entropy of low-importance tokens, normalized by its theoretical upper bound, and optimizes this reward via reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ENTRA reduces output length by 37% to 53% with no loss-and in some cases, gains-in accuracy. Our approach offers a principled and efficient solution to reduce overthinking in LRMs, and provides a generalizable path toward redundancy-aware reasoning optimization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, producing high-quality creative stories remains challenging. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution but faces two critical obstacles: designing reliable reward signals for subjective storytelling quality and mitigating training instability. This paper introduces the Reinforcement Learning for Creative Storytelling (RLCS) framework to systematically address both challenges. First, we develop a Generative Reward Model (GenRM) that provides multi-dimensional analysis and explicit reasoning about story preferences, trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from strong teacher models, followed by GRPO-based refinement on expanded preference data. Second, we introduce an entropy-based reward shaping strategy that dynamically prioritizes learning on confident errors and uncertain correct predictions, preventing overfitting on already-mastered patterns. Experiments demonstrate that GenRM achieves 68\% alignment with human creativity judgments, and RLCS significantly outperforms strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in overall story quality. This work provides a practical pipeline for applying RL to creative domains, effectively navigating the dual challenges of reward modeling and training stability.

Abstract: To meet the ever-increasing demand for computational efficiency, Neural Processing Units (NPUs) have become critical in modern AI infrastructure. However, unlocking their full potential requires developing high-performance compute kernels using vendor-specific Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), a task that demands deep hardware expertise and is labor-intensive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development. We introduce Ascend-CoT, a high-quality dataset incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning derived from real-world kernel implementations, and KernelGen-LM, a domain-adaptive model trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with execution feedback. Furthermore, we design NPUKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing compilation, correctness, and performance across varying complexity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bridges the gap between general LLMs and hardware-specific coding. Specifically, the compilation success rate on complex Level-2 kernels improves from 0% to 95.5% (Pass@10), while functional correctness achieves 64.3% compared to the baseline's complete failure. These results highlight the critical role of domain-specific reasoning and rigorous evaluation in automating accelerator-aware code generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Focus架构解决大语言模型在软件工程任务中的上下文膨胀问题，评估显示其能减少token使用且不降低准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型代理在长周期软件工程任务中因上下文膨胀面临计算成本高、延迟增加和推理能力下降等问题，现有解决方案存在不足。

Method: 提出受多头绒泡菌生物探索策略启发的Focus架构，自主整合关键学习内容并删减交互历史，使用优化支架并结合行业最佳实践进行评估。

Result: 在SWE - bench Lite的5个上下文密集实例上，Focus实现22.7%的token减少，保持60%的准确率，平均每个任务进行6.0次自主压缩，个别实例token节省达57%。

Conclusion: 有能力的模型在获得适当工具和提示时可自主调节上下文，为成本敏感的智能体系统开辟道路且不牺牲任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle with long-horizon software engineering tasks due to "Context Bloat." As interaction history grows, computational costs explode, latency increases, and reasoning capabilities degrade due to distraction by irrelevant past errors. Existing solutions often rely on passive, external summarization mechanisms that the agent cannot control. This paper proposes Focus, an agent-centric architecture inspired by the biological exploration strategies of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). The Focus Agent autonomously decides when to consolidate key learnings into a persistent "Knowledge" block and actively withdraws (prunes) the raw interaction history. Using an optimized scaffold matching industry best practices (persistent bash + string-replacement editor), we evaluated Focus on N=5 context-intensive instances from SWE-bench Lite using Claude Haiku 4.5. With aggressive prompting that encourages frequent compression, Focus achieves 22.7% token reduction (14.9M -> 11.5M tokens) while maintaining identical accuracy (3/5 = 60% for both agents). Focus performed 6.0 autonomous compressions per task on average, with token savings up to 57% on individual instances. We demonstrate that capable models can autonomously self-regulate their context when given appropriate tools and prompting, opening pathways for cost-aware agentic systems without sacrificing task performance.

Motivation: 为LLM路由提供大规模基准和统一框架，以系统评估该领域的路由方法。

Method: 引入包含超400K实例、21个数据集和33个模型的LLMRouterBench，提供综合指标，集成10个路由基线进行评估。

Result: 确认模型有强互补性，很多路由方法在统一评估下表现相似，部分新方法未超简单基线，与Oracle有差距，骨干嵌入模型影响有限，更大集合回报递减，可进行延迟感知分析。

Conclusion: LLMRouterBench可用于系统评估LLM路由领域，为后续研究提供基础，代码和数据开源。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routing assigns each query to the most suitable model from an ensemble. We introduce LLMRouterBench, a large-scale benchmark and unified framework for LLM routing. It comprises over 400K instances from 21 datasets and 33 models. Moreover, it provides comprehensive metrics for both performance-oriented routing and performance-cost trade-off routing, and integrates 10 representative routing baselines. Using LLMRouterBench, we systematically re-evaluate the field. While confirming strong model complementarity-the central premise of LLM routing-we find that many routing methods exhibit similar performance under unified evaluation, and several recent approaches, including commercial routers, fail to reliably outperform a simple baseline. Meanwhile, a substantial gap remains to the Oracle, driven primarily by persistent model-recall failures. We further show that backbone embedding models have limited impact, that larger ensembles exhibit diminishing returns compared to careful model curation, and that the benchmark also enables latency-aware analysis.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架解决大语言模型训练中数据分配问题，实验证明其效果好且能降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合监督微调与强化学习训练大语言模型的数据分配机制缺乏探索，当前策略无法诊断内在学习需求，数据与功能角色不匹配会导致优化干扰。

Method: 提出基于图式理论的PRISM框架，通过分析梯度的空间几何结构，将引发高空间集中的数据用于强化学习，产生分散更新的数据用于监督微调。

Result: 在WebShop和ALFWorld上的实验表明，PRISM实现帕累托改进，优于现有混合方法，最多降低3.22倍计算成本。

Conclusion: 基于内部优化机制分离数据对可扩展和稳健的智能体对齐至关重要。

Abstract: While Hybrid Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the standard paradigm for training LLM agents, effective mechanisms for data allocation between these stages remain largely underexplored. Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\times$. Our findings suggest that disentangling data based on internal optimization regimes is crucial for scalable and robust agent alignment.

Motivation: 当前推理模型和智能体AI系统依赖多样外部信息，但现有净化基准未考虑输入上下文噪声，需新基准评估模型鲁棒性。

Method: 引入NoisyBench，对11个数据集在多种任务中评估模型鲁棒性；使用注意力可视化等方法。

Result: 最先进模型在噪声下性能最多下降80%；基于代理的工作流会放大错误；提示、上下文工程等方法不能保证鲁棒性，RARE能增强韧性；发现反向缩放趋势，模型过度关注干扰词。

Conclusion: 为构建下一代鲁棒、有推理能力的智能体提供关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models and agentic AI systems have led to an increased reliance on diverse external information. However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents.

Motivation: 幽默梗图对AI系统理解意图构成挑战，现有模型以开环方式生成幽默解释，缺乏自我批判和完善推理的能力。

Method: 提出代理反馈推理框架FLoReNce，将梗图理解在学习时作为闭环过程，推理时作为开环过程。闭环中推理主体受判断器批判，反馈存储于知识库；推理时检索相似经验调整提示。

Result: 在PrideMM数据集上，FLoReNce的预测性能和解释质量均优于静态多模态基线模型。

Conclusion: 反馈调节提示是实现自适应梗图幽默理解的可行途径。

Abstract: Humorous memes blend visual and textual cues to convey irony, satire, or social commentary, posing unique challenges for AI systems that must interpret intent rather than surface correlations. Existing multimodal or prompting-based models generate explanations for humor but operate in an open loop,lacking the ability to critique or refine their reasoning once a prediction is made. We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning. On the PrideMM dataset, FLoReNce improves both predictive performance and explanation quality over static multimodal baselines, showing that feedback-regulated prompting is a viable path to adaptive meme humor understanding.

Method: 提出“Result -> Justify”，并引入SEF框架，通过六个结构和基础指标实施专业惯例。

Result: 四个任务的实验中，六个指标与正确性有相关性（r=0.20 - 0.42; p<0.001），SEF准确率达83.9%，比CoT高5.3%。

Conclusion: 结构化的理由说明能提高可验证性，也可能提高可靠性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) in high-stakes domains should help stakeholders trust and verify system outputs. Yet Chain-of-Thought methods reason before concluding, and logical gaps or hallucinations can yield conclusions that do not reliably align with their rationale. Thus, we propose "Result -> Justify", which constrains the output communication to present a conclusion before its structured justification. We introduce SEF (Structured Explainability Framework), operationalizing professional conventions (e.g., CREAC, BLUF) via six metrics for structure and grounding. Experiments across four tasks in three domains validate this approach: all six metrics correlate with correctness (r=0.20-0.42; p<0.001), and SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy (+5.3 over CoT). These results suggest structured justification can improve verifiability and may also improve reliability.

Result: 在各种模型主干和基准测试中，GPSO能持续显著提升性能。

Conclusion: GPSO有效缓解了推理模式的次优问题，有助于进行更强大、更具适应性的推理。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit diverse high-level reasoning patterns (e.g., direct solution, reflection-and-verification, and exploring multiple solutions), yet prevailing training recipes implicitly bias models toward a limited set of dominant patterns. Through a systematic analysis, we identify substantial accuracy variance across these patterns on mathematics and science benchmarks, revealing that a model's default reasoning pattern is often sub-optimal for a given problem. To address this, we introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework that extends GRPO by incorporating multi-pattern rollouts, verifier-guided optimal pattern selection per problem, and attention masking during optimization to prevent the leakage of explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By exploring a portfolio of diverse reasoning strategies and optimizing the policy on the most effective ones, GPSO enables the model to internalize the mapping from problem characteristics to optimal reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSO delivers consistent and substantial performance gains across various model backbones and benchmarks, effectively mitigating pattern sub-optimality and fostering more robust, adaptable reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指出将经典软件的确定性推理理念引入LLM推理堆栈存在问题，探讨LLM使用确定性推理的弊端。

Method: 从理论上分析确定性推理对LLM建模不确定性、涌现能力、推理和安全对齐等方面的影响，并通过实验展示其误导性。

Result: 确定性推理会低估能力和脆弱性、使涌现能力的相变消失、降低多路径推理的准确性和诊断洞察力、低估安全风险。

Conclusion: LLM不应采用确定性推理，应将分布变异性作为信号进行测量和控制，提倡Stochastic CHAOS。

Abstract: Deterministic inference is a comforting ideal in classical software: the same program on the same input should always produce the same output. As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.
  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.
  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.

Method: 引入多模型共识推理引擎，将大语言模型输出作为监督元学习器输入，运用语义嵌入等将自然语言响应转化为结构化特征，使用梯度提升树等方法。

Result: 基于图注意力的共识模型在多个数据集上表现出色，相比最强单模型和多数投票有显著提升，Brier分数更低，幻觉更少。

Conclusion: 监督式多模型共识是提升大语言模型可靠性的实用方法，单机器设置下也可行。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong aver- age performance yet remain unreliable at the instance level, with frequent hallucinations, brittle failures, and poorly calibrated confidence. We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource- constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hal- lucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing com- plementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.

Result: LRAS比现有基线表现高8.2 - 32%，在需要可靠知识深度推理的任务中提升显著。

Conclusion: LRAS能让法律大语言模型识别知识边界，处理法律推理复杂性，后续将发布数据和模型。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated exceptional logical capabilities in mathematical domains, their application to the legal field remains hindered by the strict requirements for procedural rigor and adherence to legal logic. Existing legal LLMs, which rely on "closed-loop reasoning" derived solely from internal parametric knowledge, frequently suffer from lack of self-awareness regarding their knowledge boundaries, leading to confident yet incorrect conclusions. To address this challenge, we present Legal Reasoning with Agentic Search (LRAS), the first framework designed to transition legal LLMs from static and parametric "closed-loop thinking" to dynamic and interactive "Active Inquiry". By integrating Introspective Imitation Learning and Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning, LRAS enables LRMs to identify knowledge boundaries and handle legal reasoning complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that LRAS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 8.2-32\%, with the most substantial gains observed in tasks requiring deep reasoning with reliable knowledge. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon.

Abstract: Interactive large language model agents have advanced rapidly, but most remain specialized to a single environment and fail to adapt robustly to other environments. Model merging offers a training-free alternative by integrating multiple experts into a single model. In this paper, we propose Agent-Role Merging (ARM), an activation-guided, role-conditioned neuron transplantation method for model merging in LLM agents. ARM improves existing merging methods from static natural language tasks to multi-turn agent scenarios, and over the generalization ability across various interactive environments. This is achieved with a well designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency. Across diverse domains, the model obtained via ARM merging outperforms prior model merging methods and domain-specific expert models, while demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization.

Method: 引入基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能诊断框架，结合模型上下文协议（MCP），通过调用工具自主探索基础设施模型，并定义调查协议规范推理过程。

Result: 文中未提及直接实验结果。

Conclusion: 该工作为自主事件解决和变更影响缓解奠定基础，未来系统有望诊断、修复故障并预测变更影响。

Abstract: Large-scale telecom and datacenter infrastructures rely on multi-layered service and resource models, where failures propagate across physical and logical components and affect multiple customers. Traditional approaches to root cause analysis(RCA) rely on hard-coded graph traversal algorithms or rule-based correlation engines, which are costly to maintain and tightly coupled to the infrastructure model.
  In this work, we introduce an agentic diagnostic framework where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs step-wise investigation using a constrained tool space exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information.
  This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation. Future systems will not only diagnose and remediate infrastructure failures, but also predict the impact of planned changes on services and customers, enabling operators to mitigate risks before executing maintenance operations.

Result: 基于预测能力的定义有解释力和可行性但无法充分解释预测与行为/收益的关系，提出 EPH 并给出统一框架解释智能多方面。

Conclusion: EPH 是比较人类和人工智能最令人满意且通用的定义。

Abstract: This paper aims to propose a universal definition of intelligence that enables fair and consistent comparison of human and artificial intelligence (AI). With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field.
  This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.
  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence.

Abstract: Modular end-to-end (ME2E) autonomous driving paradigms combine modular interpretability with global optimization capability and have demonstrated strong performance. However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.

TL;DR: 提出IFDNS方法解决大语言模型逻辑推理问题，实验证明能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法缺乏忠实性，神经符号方法存在信息丢失问题，需改进大语言模型逻辑推理能力。

Method: 引入Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS)，采用多轮反馈机制，在逻辑提取阶段利用迭代反馈准确提取因果关系并转化为表达式，且可与现有提示方法集成。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，IFDNS显著提升了CoT和CoT - SC的性能，如在LogiQA数据集上使CoT准确率提升9.40%，在PrOntoQA数据集上使CoT - SC提升11.70%。

Conclusion: IFDNS是一种有效的解决大语言模型逻辑推理问题的方法，能改善现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of reasoning tasks, including logical and mathematical problem-solving. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型记忆方法在时间维度建模存在时间不准确和时间碎片化的问题，影响对记忆的利用，需新方法解决。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo上的实验显示，TSM始终优于现有方法，准确率最高提升12.2%。

Conclusion: 提出的TSM方法有效，能更好地对大语言模型中的记忆时间维度进行建模。

Abstract: Memory enables Large Language Model (LLM) agents to perceive, store, and use information from past dialogues, which is essential for personalization. However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a central problem for context-aware applications, especially for smart homes and assisted living. A few very recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for HAR at home, reaching high performance and addressing key challenges. In this paper, we provide new experimental results regarding the use of LLMs for HAR, on two state-of-the-art datasets. More specifically, we show how recognition performance evolves depending on the size of the LLM used. Moreover, we experiment on the use of knowledge distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller LLMs with HAR reasoning examples generated by larger LLMs. We show that such fine-tuned models can perform almost as well as the largest LLMs, while having 50 times less parameters.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on accumulated memory to solve long-horizon decision-making tasks. However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines.

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based agentic workflows is challenging for scaling AI capabilities. Current methods rely on coarse, end-to-end evaluation signals and lack fine-grained signals on where to refine, often resulting in inefficient or low-impact modifications. To address these limitations, we propose {\our{}}, an Evaluation-Judge-Optimization-Update pipeline. We incorporate reusable, configurable logic blocks into agentic workflows to capture fundamental forms of logic. On top of this abstraction, we design a dedicated Judge module that inspects execution traces -- particularly failed runs -- and assigns rank-based responsibility scores to problematic blocks. These fine-grained diagnostic signals are then leveraged by an LLM-based optimizer, which focuses modifications on the most problematic block in the workflow. Our approach improves sample efficiency, enhances interpretability through block-level diagnostics, and provides a scalable foundation for automating increasingly complex agentic workflows. We evaluate {\our{}} on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, where {\our{}} achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to improve in reasoning and decision-making, there is a growing need for realistic and interactive environments where their abilities can be rigorously evaluated. We present VirtualEnv, a next-generation simulation platform built on Unreal Engine 5 that enables fine-grained benchmarking of LLMs in embodied and interactive scenarios. VirtualEnv supports rich agent-environment interactions, including object manipulation, navigation, and adaptive multi-agent collaboration, as well as game-inspired mechanics like escape rooms and procedurally generated environments. We provide a user-friendly API built on top of Unreal Engine, allowing researchers to deploy and control LLM-driven agents using natural language instructions. We integrate large-scale LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-based models, to generate novel environments and structured tasks from multimodal inputs. Our experiments benchmark the performance of several popular LLMs across tasks of increasing complexity, analyzing differences in adaptability, planning, and multi-agent coordination. We also describe our methodology for procedural task generation, task validation, and real-time environment control. VirtualEnv is released as an open-source platform, we aim to advance research at the intersection of AI and gaming, enable standardized evaluation of LLMs in embodied AI settings, and pave the way for future developments in immersive simulations and interactive entertainment.

Result: 在TravelPlanner、ScienceWorld和HotpotQA上，TDP优于强基线，最多减少82%的令牌消耗。

Conclusion: 子任务解耦能提升长任务代理的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously execute complex, long-horizon tasks, yet planning remains a primary bottleneck for reliable task execution. Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.

Conclusion: DIAGPaper显著优于现有方法，为论文弱点识别提供了更好方案。

Abstract: Paper weakness identification using single-agent or multi-agent LLMs has attracted increasing attention, yet existing approaches exhibit key limitations. Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users. Experiments on two benchmarks, AAAR and ReviewCritique, demonstrate that DIAGPaper substantially outperforms existing methods by producing more valid and more paper-specific weaknesses, while presenting them in a user-oriented, prioritized manner.

Conclusion: SALT - KG建立了一个基于声明性知识推进表格基础模型的基准，是企业规模结构化数据中语义链接表格的第一步。

Abstract: Building upon the SALT benchmark for relational prediction (Klein et al., 2024), we introduce SALT-KG, a benchmark for semantics-aware learning on enterprise tables. SALT-KG extends SALT by linking its multi-table transactional data with a structured Operational Business Knowledge represented in a Metadata Knowledge Graph (OBKG) that captures field-level descriptions, relational dependencies, and business object types. This extension enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics, an increasingly critical capability for foundation models on structured data. Empirical analysis reveals that while metadata-derived features yield modest improvements in classical prediction metrics, these metadata features consistently highlight gaps in the ability of models to leverage semantics in relational context. By reframing tabular prediction as semantics-conditioned reasoning, SALT-KG establishes a benchmark to advance tabular foundation models grounded in declarative knowledge, providing the first empirical step toward semantically linked tables in structured data at enterprise scale.

Abstract: The central challenge of AI for Science is not reasoning alone, but the ability to create computational methods in an open-ended scientific world. Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools.

Abstract: It has been shown that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) may not *say what they think*: they do not always volunteer information about how certain parts of the input influence their reasoning. But it is one thing for a model to *omit* such information and another, worse thing to *lie* about it. Here, we extend the work of Chen et al. (2025) to show that LRMs will do just this: they will flatly deny relying on hints provided in the prompt in answering multiple choice questions -- even when directly asked to reflect on unusual (i.e. hinted) prompt content, even when allowed to use hints, and even though experiments *show* them to be using the hints. Our results thus have discouraging implications for CoT monitoring and interpretability.

Abstract: Dementia is a complex syndrome impacting cognitive and emotional functions, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common form. This study focuses on enhancing dementia prediction using machine learning (ML) techniques on patient health data. Supervised learning algorithms are applied in this study, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Gaussian Process Classifiers. To address class imbalance and improve model performance, techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization were employed. Among the models, LDA achieved the highest testing accuracy of 98%. This study highlights the importance of model interpretability and the correlation of dementia with features such as the presence of the APOE-epsilon4 allele and chronic conditions like diabetes. This research advocates for future ML innovations, particularly in integrating explainable AI approaches, to further improve predictive capabilities in dementia care.

Conclusion: 架构设计、训练目标和在严格输出约束下整合检索上下文的能力共同决定性能，该基准符合数字孪生系统实时要求，严重程度分类可评估模型能力和实时部署性，对根本原因分析和数字孪生集成有意义。

Abstract: System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.

Abstract: Deep generative models, particularly denoising diffusion models, have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity generation of architected microstructures with desired properties and styles. Nevertheless, these recent methods typically rely on conditional training mechanisms and demand substantial computational effort to prepare the labeled training dataset, which makes them inflexible since any change in the governing equations or boundary conditions requires a complete retraining process. In this study, we propose a new inverse design framework that integrates unconditional denoising diffusion models with differentiable programming techniques for architected microstructure generation. Our approach eliminates the need for expensive labeled dataset preparation and retraining for different problem settings. By reinterpreting the noise input to the diffusion model as an optimizable design variable, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem over the noise input, enabling control over the reverse denoising trajectory to guide the generated microstructure toward the desired mechanical properties while preserving the stylistic constraints encoded in the training dataset. A unified differentiation pipeline via vector-Jacobian product concatenations is developed to enable end-to-end gradient evaluation through backpropagation. Several numerical examples, ranging from the design of microstructures with specified homogenized properties to those with targeted hyperelastic and elasto-plastic behaviors, showcase the effectiveness of the framework and its potential for advanced design tasks involving diverse performance and style requirements.

Conclusion: 所提框架可在有限分子动力学模拟下建立Hugoniot曲线，有一定应用价值。

Abstract: A physics-constrained Gaussian Process regression framework is developed for predicting shocked material states along the Hugoniot curve using data from a small number of shockwave simulations. The proposed Gaussian process employs a probabilistic Taylor series expansion in conjunction with the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions between the various shocked material states to construct a thermodynamically consistent covariance function. This leads to the formulation of an optimization problem over a small number of interpretable hyperparameters and enables the identification of regime transitions, from a leading elastic wave to trailing plastic and phase transformation waves. This work is motivated by the need to investigate shock-driven material response for materials discovery and for offering mechanistic insights in regimes where experimental characterizations and simulations are costly. The proposed methodology relies on large-scale molecular dynamics which are an accurate but expensive computational alternative to experiments. Under these constraints, the proposed methodology establishes Hugoniot curves from a limited number of molecular dynamics simulations. We consider silicon carbide as a representative material and atomic-level simulations are performed using a reverse ballistic approach together with appropriate interatomic potentials. The framework reproduces the Hugoniot curve with satisfactory accuracy while also quantifying the uncertainty in the predictions using the Gaussian Process posterior.

Conclusion: AdaField是可泛化和迁移的表面压力场建模解决方案，支持多种运输系统的空气动力学设计。

Abstract: The surface pressure field of transportation systems, including cars, trains, and aircraft, is critical for aerodynamic analysis and design. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as promising and efficient methods for modeling surface pressure field, being alternatives to computationally expensive CFD simulations. Currently, large-scale public datasets are available for domains such as automotive aerodynamics. However, in many specialized areas, such as high-speed trains, data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in aerodynamic modeling, severely limiting the effectiveness of standard neural network approaches. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Field Learning Framework (AdaField), which pre-trains the model on public large-scale datasets to improve generalization in sub-domains with limited data. AdaField comprises two key components. First, we design the Semantic Aggregation Point Transformer (SAPT) as a high-performance backbone that efficiently handles large-scale point clouds for surface pressure prediction. Second, regarding the substantial differences in flow conditions and geometric scales across different aerodynamic subdomains, we propose Flow-Conditioned Adapter (FCA) and Physics-Informed Data Augmentation (PIDA). FCA enables the model to flexibly adapt to different flow conditions with a small set of trainable parameters, while PIDA expands the training data distribution to better cover variations in object scale and velocity. Our experiments show that AdaField achieves SOTA performance on the DrivAerNet++ dataset and can be effectively transferred to train and aircraft scenarios with minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight AdaField's potential as a generalizable and transferable solution for surface pressure field modeling, supporting efficient aerodynamic design across a wide range of transportation systems.

Abstract: Reduced-order modeling lies at the interface of numerical analysis and data-driven scientific computing, providing principled ways to compress high-fidelity simulations in science and engineering. We propose a training framework that couples a continuous-time form of operator inference with the adjoint-state method to obtain robust data-driven reduced-order models. This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了现有文本到SQL方法的问题，能实现更好的性能。

Abstract: Robust text-to-SQL over complex, real-world databases remains brittle even with modern LLMs: iterative refinement often introduces syntactic and semantic drift, corrections tend to be non-transferable across queries, and naive use of large context windows scales poorly. We propose a controlled text-to-SQL framework built around reflective refinement. Instead of repeatedly rewriting the current SQL instance, the system decomposes generation into typed stages and applies feedback as persistent updates to the stage-level generation mechanism. A Reflection-Refinement Loop localizes violations to the responsible stage maximize preservation of previously validated constraints and support monotonic improvement over a query set. The method operates without gold SQL by combining interpreter-based checks with LLM-based semantic coverage verification as epistemic judges. Experiments on Spider and BIRD demonstrate consistent gains over strong prompting baselines, robust convergence within a small refinement budget, and improved execution accuracy across both frontier and open-weight model families.

Abstract: Graph database query languages cannot express algorithms like PageRank, forcing costly data wrangling, while existing solutions such as algorithm libraries, vertex-centric APIs, and recursive CTEs lack the necessary combination of expressiveness, performance, and usability. We present GraphAlg: a domain-specific language for graph algorithms that compiles to relational algebra, enabling seamless integration with query processing pipelines. Built on linear algebra foundations, GraphAlg provides intuitive matrix operations that are amenable to aggressive optimization including sparsity analysis, loop-invariant code motion, and in-place aggregation. Our implementation in AvantGraph demonstrates significant code complexity reduction compared to SQL/Python and Pregel while achieving excellent performance on LDBC Graphalytics benchmarks. GraphAlg establishes that graph databases can serve as unified platforms for both queries and analytics.

Abstract: The rapid integration of vector search into AI applications, particularly for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), has catalyzed the emergence of a diverse ecosystem of specialized vector databases. While this innovation offers a rich choice of features and performance characteristics, it has simultaneously introduced a significant challenge: severe API fragmentation. Developers face a landscape of disparate, proprietary, and often volatile API contracts, which hinders application portability, increases maintenance overhead, and leads to vendor lock-in. This paper introduces Vextra, a novel middleware abstraction layer designed to address this fragmentation. Vextra presents a unified, high-level API for core database operations, including data upsertion, similarity search, and metadata filtering. It employs a pluggable adapter architecture to translate these unified API calls into the native protocols of various backend databases. We argue that such an abstraction layer is a critical step towards maturing the vector database ecosystem, fostering interoperability, and enabling higher-level query optimization, while imposing minimal performance overhead.

Method: 分析不同查询类别的复杂度，包括联合复杂度和数据复杂度，对比不同操作（如投影、连接）在查询中的情况。

Result: 确定部分查询类别的修复问题可在多项式时间解决，部分是NP难或难近似的，部分复杂度为OptP[log(n)]-complete等；递归会增加复杂度，数据复杂度角度部分查询可多项式时间解决。

Conclusion: 不同查询类别和操作下，数据库修复问题复杂度不同，半正datalog程序表达的查询在数据复杂度上可多项式时间确定最小修复。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying database repairs for missing tuples in query answers. We show that when the query is part of the input - the combined complexity setting - determining whether or not a repair exists is polynomial-time is equivalent to the satisfiability problem for classes of queries admitting a weak form of projection and selection. We then identify the sub-classes of unions of conjunctive queries with negated atoms, defined by the relational algebra operations permitted to appear in the query, for which the minimal repair problem can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast, we show that the problem is NP-hard, as well as set cover-hard to approximate via strict reductions, whenever both projection and join are permitted in the input query. Additionally, we show that finding the size of a minimal repair for unions of conjunctive queries (with negated atoms permitted) is OptP[log(n)]-complete, while computing a minimal repair is possible with O($n^2$) queries to an NP oracle. With recursion permitted, the combined complexity of all of these variants increases significantly, with an EXP lower bound. However, from the data complexity perspective, we show that minimal repairs can be identified in polynomial time for all queries expressible as semi-positive datalog programs.

Conclusion: VISTA是有效的船舶轨迹插补框架，代码和实现细节公开。

Abstract: The Automatic Identification System provides critical information for maritime navigation and safety, yet its trajectories are often incomplete due to signal loss or deliberate tampering. Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks. The source code and implementation details of VISTA are publicly available.

Method: 基于Vamana图索引，提出CUDA批并行构建算法、GPU高效的RaBitQ量化实现、优化的贪心搜索内核来克服局限。

Result: 在五个数据集评估中，Jasper比CAGRA查询吞吐量高1.93倍，构建速度平均快2.4倍，比BANG查询速度快19 - 131倍。

Conclusion: Jasper是一个具有高查询吞吐量和可更新性的GPU原生ANNS系统，性能优于现有系统。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a core problem in machine learning and information retrieval applications. GPUs offer a promising path to high-performance ANNS: they provide massive parallelism for distance computations, are readily available, and can co-locate with downstream applications.
  Despite these advantages, current GPU-accelerated ANNS systems face three key limitations. First, real-world applications operate on evolving datasets that require fast batch updates, yet most GPU indices must be rebuilt from scratch when new data arrives. Second, high-dimensional vectors strain memory bandwidth, but current GPU systems lack efficient quantization techniques that reduce data movement without introducing costly random memory accesses. Third, the data-dependent memory accesses inherent to greedy search make overlapping compute and memory difficult, leading to reduced performance.
  We present Jasper, a GPU-native ANNS system with both high query throughput and updatability. Jasper builds on the Vamana graph index and overcomes existing bottlenecks via three contributions: (1) a CUDA batch-parallel construction algorithm that enables lock-free streaming insertions, (2) a GPU-efficient implementation of RaBitQ quantization that reduces memory footprint up to 8x without the random access penalties, and (3) an optimized greedy search kernel that increases compute utilization, resulting in better latency hiding and higher throughput.
  Our evaluation across five datasets shows that Jasper achieves up to 1.93x higher query throughput than CAGRA and achieves up to 80% peak utilization as measured by the roofline model. Jasper's construction scales efficiently and constructs indices an average of 2.4x faster than CAGRA while providing updatability that CAGRA lacks. Compared to BANG, the previous fastest GPU Vamana implementation, Jasper delivers 19-131x faster queries.

Conclusion: RAIRS有效解决了IVF的列表选择和冗余距离计算问题，提升搜索性能。

Abstract: IVF is one of the most widely used ANNS (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search) methods in vector databases. The idea of redundant assignment is to assign a data vector to more than one IVF lists for reducing the chance of missing true neighbors in IVF search. However, the naive strategy, which selects the second IVF list based on the distance between a data vector and the list centroids, performs poorly. Previous work focuses only on the inner product distance, while there is no optimized list selection study for the most popular Euclidean space. Moreover, the IVF search may access the same vector in more than one lists, resulting in redundant distance computation and decreasing query throughput. In this paper, we present RAIRS to address the above two challenges. For the challenge of the list selection, we propose an optimized AIR metric for the Euclidean space. AIR takes not only distances but also directions into consideration in order to support queries that are closer to the data vector but father away from the first chosen list's centroid. For the challenge of redundant distance computation, we propose SEIL, an optimized list layout that exploits shared cells to reduce repeated distance computations for IVF search. Our experimental results using representative real-world data sets show that RAIRS out-performs existing redundant assignment solutions and achieves up to 1.33x improvement over the best-performing IVF method, IVF-PQ Fast Scan with refinement.

Motivation: 现有远程内存键值存储架构难以同时兼顾峰值效率、架构简单性和有序操作的原生支持，有多种局限性，因此需要新方案。

Method: 利用BlueField - 3 SmartNIC的DPAs消除操作系统开销，借助DPAs直接从NIC缓冲区获取网络请求，在加速器本地内存中导航无锁学习索引，减少PCIe跨越，将写操作分阶段处理。

Result: 系统实现点查找每秒3300万次操作，范围查询每秒1300万次操作，性能与或超越现有最先进解决方案。

Conclusion: 该架构表现优秀，同时指出硬件改进可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Remote in-memory key-value (KV) stores serve as a cornerstone for diverse modern workloads, and high-speed range scans are frequently a requirement. However, current architectures rarely achieve a simultaneous balance of peak efficiency, architectural simplicity, and native support for ordered operations. Conventional host-centric frameworks are restricted by kernel-space network stacks and internal bus latencies. While hash-based alternatives that utilize OS-bypass or run natively on SmartNICs offer high throughput, they lack the data structures necessary for range queries. Distributed RDMA-based systems provide performance and range functionality but often depend on stateful clients, which introduces complexity in scaling and error handling. Alternatively, SmartNIC implementations that traverse trees located in host memory are hampered by high DMA round-trip latencies.
  This paper introduces a KV store that leverages the on-path Data Path Accelerators (DPAs) of the BlueField-3 SmartNIC to eliminate operating system overhead while facilitating stateless clients and range operations. These DPAs ingest network requests directly from NIC buffers to navigate a lock-free learned index residing in the accelerator's local memory. By deferring value retrieval from the host-side tree replica until the leaf level is reached, the design minimizes PCIe crossings. Write operations are staged in DPA memory and migrated in batches to the host, where structural maintenance is performed before being transactionally stitched back to the SmartNIC. Coupled with a NIC-resident read cache, the system achieves 33 million operations per second (MOPS) for point lookups and 13 MOPS for range queries. Our analysis demonstrates that this architecture matches or exceeds the performance of contemporary state-of-the-art solutions, while we identify hardware refinements that could further accelerate performance.

Motivation: 现有启发式方法缺乏每核频率监控，任务分配未详细分析执行模式，无法解决核心活动不均导致的过热问题，且单一基准下性能、能耗和热目标常冲突。

Method: 提出HiDVFS调度器，利用三个代理基于分析数据、核心温度和优先考虑执行时间目标优化任务分配，用带能耗和温度正则化的执行时间奖励估计未来状态。

Result: 在NVIDIA Jetson TX2上实验，HiDVFS相比先进方法有更好调优性能，平均执行时间4.16 ± 0.58s，加速比3.44倍，能耗降低50.4%；在所有基准测试中平均加速比3.95倍，能耗降低47.1%。

Conclusion: HiDVFS能有效优化任务分配，在提高性能的同时降低能耗。

Abstract: With advancements in multicore embedded systems, leakage power, exponentially tied to chip temperature, has surpassed dynamic power consumption. Energy-aware solutions use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to mitigate overheating in performance-intensive scenarios, while software approaches allocate high-utilization tasks across core configurations in parallel systems to reduce power. However, existing heuristics lack per-core frequency monitoring, failing to address overheating from uneven core activity, and task assignments without detailed profiling overlook irregular execution patterns. We target OpenMP DAG workloads. Because makespan, energy, and thermal goals often conflict within a single benchmark, this work prioritizes performance (makespan) while reporting energy and thermal as secondary outcomes. To overcome these issues, we propose HiDVFS (a hierarchical multi-agent, performance-aware DVFS scheduler) for parallel systems that optimizes task allocation based on profiling data, core temperatures, and makespan-first objectives. It employs three agents: one selects cores and frequencies using profiler data, another manages core combinations via temperature sensors, and a third sets task priorities during resource contention. A makespan-focused reward with energy and temperature regularizers estimates future states and enhances sample efficiency. Experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using the BOTS suite (9 benchmarks) compare HiDVFS against state-of-the-art approaches. With multi-seed validation (seeds 42, 123, 456), HiDVFS achieves the best finetuned performance with 4.16 plus/minus 0.58s average makespan (L10), representing a 3.44x speedup over GearDVFS (14.32 plus/minus 2.61s) and 50.4% energy reduction (63.7 kJ vs 128.4 kJ). Across all BOTS benchmarks, HiDVFS achieves an average 3.95x speedup and 47.1% energy reduction.

Result: 学习增强模型性能优于标准 Roofline 和 ECM 模型，在不同处理器上都有很低的平均绝对百分比误差。

Conclusion: 提出的学习增强模型能有效解决高算术密集型张量 n 模积内核的性能预测问题。

Abstract: Accurate performance prediction is essential for optimizing scientific applications on modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.

Conclusion: 利用现货实例的时空异质性可降低作业执行成本，SkyNomad系统能有效降低成本并保证截止时间。

Abstract: AI batch jobs such as model training, inference pipelines, and data analytics require substantial GPU resources and often need to finish before a deadline. Spot instances offer 3-10x lower cost than on-demand instances, but their unpredictable availability makes meeting deadlines difficult. Existing systems either rely solely on spot instances and risk deadline violations, or operate in simplified single-region settings. These approaches overlook substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in spot availability, lifetimes, and prices. We show that exploiting such heterogeneity to access more spot capacity is the key to reduce the job execution cost. We present SkyNomad, a multi-region scheduling system that maximizes spot usage and minimizes cost while guaranteeing deadlines. SkyNomad uses lightweight probing to estimate availability, predicts spot lifetimes, accounts for migration cost, and unifies regional characteristics and deadline pressure into a monetary cost model that guides scheduling decisions. Our evaluation shows that SkyNomad achieves 1.25-3.96x cost savings in real cloud deployments and performs within 10% cost differences of an optimal policy in simulation, while consistently meeting deadlines.

Abstract: We present the design of a Resource-Aware Task Allocator (RATA) and an empirical analysis in handling real-time tasks for processing on Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). We consider task processing performance across low Earth orbit (LEO) to Low-Medium Earth Orbit (Low-MEO) constellation sizes, under varying traffic loads. Using Single-Level Tree Network(SLTN)-based cooperative task allocation architecture, we attempt to evaluate some key performance metrics - blocking probabilities, response times, energy consumption, and resource utilization across several tens of thousands of tasks per experiment. Our resource-conscious RATA monitors key parameters such as arrival rate, resources (on-board compute, storage, bandwidth, battery) availability, satellite eclipses' influence in processing and communications. This study is an important step towards analyzing the performance under lighter to stress inducing levels of compute intense workloads to test the ultimate performance limits under the combined influence of the above-mentioned factors. Results show pronounced non-linear scaling: while capacity increases with constellation size, blocking and delay grow rapidly, whereas energy remains resilient under solar-aware scheduling. The analysis identifies a practical satellite-count limit for baseline SLTNs and demonstrates that CPU availability, rather than energy, is the primary cause of blocking. These findings provide quantitative guidance by identifying thresholds at which system performance shifts from graceful degradation to collapse.

Abstract: Inherent client drifts caused by data heterogeneity, as well as vulnerability to Byzantine attacks within the system, hinder effective model training and convergence in federated learning (FL). This paper presents two new frameworks, named DiveRgence-based Adaptive aGgregation (DRAG) and Byzantine-Resilient DRAG (BR-DRAG), to mitigate client drifts and resist attacks while expediting training. DRAG designs a reference direction and a metric named divergence of degree to quantify the deviation of local updates. Accordingly, each worker can align its local update via linear calibration without extra communication cost. BR-DRAG refines DRAG under Byzantine attacks by maintaining a vetted root dataset at the server to produce trusted reference directions. The workers' updates can be then calibrated to mitigate divergence caused by malicious attacks. We analytically prove that DRAG and BR-DRAG achieve fast convergence for non-convex models under partial worker participation, data heterogeneity, and Byzantine attacks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of DRAG and its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in handling client drifts, and highlight the robustness of BR-DRAG in maintaining resilience against data heterogeneity and diverse Byzantine attacks.

Abstract: 3D object detection using LiDAR-based point cloud data and deep neural networks is essential in autonomous driving technology. However, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices present challenges due to high computational demands and energy consumption. Additionally, single LiDAR setups suffer from blind spots. This paper proposes SC-MII, multiple infrastructure LiDAR-based 3D object detection on edge devices for Split Computing with Multiple Intermediate outputs Integration. In SC-MII, edge devices process local point clouds through the initial DNN layers and send intermediate outputs to an edge server. The server integrates these features and completes inference, reducing both latency and device load while improving privacy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show a 2.19x speed-up and a 71.6% reduction in edge device processing time, with at most a 1.09% drop in accuracy.

Motivation: 无服务器计算中的FaaS模式适合数据量大且需近数据计算的大规模科学基础设施，SKAO面临数据处理挑战，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 研究无服务器和FaaS计算原理，开发并部署用于天体物理数据分析的代表性函数，实现高斯卷积函数并集成到SRCNet生态。

Result: FaaS可嵌入现有SRCNet生态，函数能在数据副本存储地运行，减少延迟、传输并提高效率。

Conclusion: 无服务器模型为应对SKA时代数据量提供了可扩展且高效的途径。

Abstract: Serverless computing is a paradigm in which the underlying infrastructure is fully managed by the provider, enabling applications and services to be executed with elastic resource provisioning and minimal operational overhead. A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era.

Abstract: The rapid development of interactive and autonomous AI systems signals our entry into the agentic era. Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.

Result: 利用近似理论工具形式化学习索引结构的时空权衡。

Conclusion: 所推导的下界揭示了学习索引方法的核心局限性。

Abstract: Learned index structures aim to accelerate queries by training machine learning models to approximate the rank function associated with a database attribute. While effective in practice, their theoretical limitations are not fully understood. We present a general framework for proving lower bounds on query time for learned indexes, expressed in terms of their space overhead and parameterized by the model class used for approximation. Our formulation captures a broad family of learned indexes, including most existing designs, as piecewise model-based predictors.
  We solve the problem of lower bounding query time in two steps: first, we use probabilistic tools to control the effect of sampling when the database attribute is drawn from a probability distribution. Then, we analyze the approximation-theoretic problem of how to optimally represent a cumulative distribution function with approximators from a given model class. Within this framework, we derive lower bounds under a range of modeling and distributional assumptions, paying particular attention to the case of piecewise linear and piecewise constant model classes, which are common in practical implementations.
  Our analysis shows how tools from approximation theory, such as quantization and Kolmogorov widths, can be leveraged to formalize the space-time tradeoffs inherent to learned index structures. The resulting bounds illuminate core limitations of these methods.

Conclusion: 提出的新型随机查询问题具有独立研究价值，有望引发后续工作并应用于其他领域。

Abstract: We consider the following Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation problem, which is closely related to several problems from the literature. A matroid $\mathcal{M}$ (in compact representation) on ground set $E$ is given, and each element $i\in E$ is active independently with known probability $p_i\in(0,1)$. The elements can be queried, upon which it is revealed whether the respective element is active or not. The goal is to find an adaptive querying strategy for determining whether there is a basis of $\mathcal{M}$ in which all elements are active, with the objective of minimizing the expected number of queries.
  When $\mathcal{M}$ is a uniform matroid, this is the problem of evaluating a $k$-of-$n$ function, first studied in the 1970s. This problem is well-understood, and has an optimal adaptive strategy that can be computed in polynomial time.
  Taking $\mathcal{M}$ to instead be a partition matroid, we show that previous approaches fail to give a constant-factor approximation. Our main result is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm producing a randomized strategy for this partition matroid problem. We obtain this result by combining a new technique with several well-established techniques. Our algorithm adaptively interleaves solutions to several instances of a novel type of stochastic querying problem, with a constraint on the $\textit{expected}$ cost. We believe that this type of problem is of independent interest, will spark follow-up work, and has the potential for additional applications.

Abstract: In this short note, we initiate the study of the Linear Isomorphism Testing Problem in the setting of communication complexity, a natural linear algebraic generalization of the classical Equality problem. Given Boolean functions $f, g : \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{-1, +1\}$, Alice and Bob are tasked with determining whether $f$ and $g$ are equivalent up to a nonsingular linear transformation of the input variables, or far from being so. This problem has been extensively investigated in several models of computation, including standard algorithmic and property testing frameworks, owing to its fundamental connections with combinatorial circuit design, complexity theory, and cryptography. However, despite its broad relevance, it has remained unexplored in the context of communication complexity, a gap we address in this work.
  Our main results demonstrate that the approximate spectral norm of the input functions plays a central role in governing the communication complexity of this problem. We design a simple deterministic protocol whose communication cost is polynomial in the approximate spectral norm, and complement it with nearly matching lower bounds (up to a quadratic gap). In the randomised setting with private coins, we present an even more efficient protocol, though equally simple, that achieves a quadratically improved dependence on the approximate spectral norm compared to the deterministic case, and we prove that such a dependence is essentially unavoidable.
  These results identify the approximate spectral norm as a key complexity measure for testing linear invariance in the communication complexity framework. As a core technical ingredient, we establish new junta theorems for Boolean functions with small approximate spectral norm, which may be of independent interest in Fourier analysis and learning theory.

Abstract: Vertex Subset Problems (VSPs) are a class of combinatorial optimization problems on graphs where the goal is to find a subset of vertices satisfying a predefined condition. Two prominent approaches for solving VSPs are dynamic programming over tree-like structures, such as tree decompositions or clique decompositions, and linear programming. In this work, we establish a sharp connection between both approaches by showing that if a vertex-subset problem $Π$ admits a solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithm that produces tables of size at most $α(k,n)$ when processing a tree decomposition of width at most $k$ of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, then the polytope $P_Π(G)$ defined as the convex-hull of solutions of $Π$ in $G$ has extension complexity at most $O(α(k,n)\cdot n)$. Additionally, this upper bound is optimal under the exponential time hypothesis (ETH).
  On the one hand, our results imply that ETH-optimal solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms for combinatorial problems yield optimal-size parameterized extended formulations for the solution polytopes associated with instances of these problems. On the other hand, unconditional lower bounds obtained in the realm of the theory of extended formulations yield unconditional lower bounds on the table complexity of solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms.

Conclusion: 在在线决策中，结合预测与到达顺序控制有好处。

Abstract: We study a learning-augmented variant of the secretary problem, recently introduced by Fujii and Yoshida (2023), in which the decision-maker has access to machine-learned predictions of candidate values. The central challenge is to balance consistency and robustness: when predictions are accurate, the algorithm should select a near-optimal secretary, while under inaccurate predictions it should still guarantee a bounded competitive ratio.
  We consider both the classical Random Order Secretary Problem (ROSP), where candidates arrive in a uniformly random order, and a more natural learning-augmented model in which the decision-maker may choose the arrival order based on predicted values. We call this model the Chosen Order Secretary Problem (COSP), capturing scenarios such as interview schedules set in advance.
  We propose a new randomized algorithm applicable to both ROSP and COSP. Our method switches from fully trusting predictions to a threshold-based rule once a large prediction deviation is detected. Let $ε\in [0,1]$ denote the maximum multiplicative prediction error. For ROSP, our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $\max\{0.221, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\}$, improving upon the prior bound of $\max\{0.215, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\}$. For COSP, we achieve $\max\{0.262, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\}$, surpassing the $0.25$ worst-case bound for prior approaches and moving closer to the classical secretary benchmark of $1/e \approx 0.368$. These results highlight the benefit of combining predictions with arrival-order control in online decision-making.

Abstract: Several recent results from dynamic and sublinear graph coloring are surveyed. This problem is widely studied and has motivating applications like network topology control, constraint satisfaction, and real-time resource scheduling. Graph coloring algorithms are called colorers. In §1 are defined graph coloring, the dynamic model, and the notion of performance of graph algorithms in the dynamic model. In particular $(Δ+ 1)$-coloring, sublinear performance, and oblivious and adaptive adversaries are noted and motivated. In §2 the pair of approximately optimal dynamic vertex colorers given in arXiv:1708.09080 are summarized as a warmup for the $(Δ+ 1)$-colorers. In §3 the state of the art in dynamic $(Δ+ 1)$-coloring is presented. This section comprises a pair of papers (arXiv:1711.04355 and arXiv:1910.02063) that improve dynamic $(Δ+ 1)$-coloring from the naive algorithm with $O(Δ)$ expected amortized update time to $O(\log Δ)$, then to $O(1)$ with high probability. In §4 the results in arXiv:2411.04418, which gives a sublinear algorithm for $(Δ+ 1)$-coloring that generalizes oblivious adversaries to adaptive adversaries, are presented.

Abstract: Strategic manipulation of elections is typically studied in the context of promoting individual candidates.
  In parliamentary elections, however, the focus shifts: voters may care more about the overall governing coalition than the individual parties' seat counts.
  This paper studies this new problem: manipulating parliamentary elections with the goal of promoting the collective seat count of a coalition of parties.
  We focus on proportional representation elections, and consider two variants of the problem; one in which the sole goal is to maximize the total number of seats held by the desired coalition, and the other with a dual objective of both promoting the coalition and promoting the relative power of some favorite party within the coalition.
  We examine two types of strategic manipulations:
  \emph{bribery}, which allows modifying voters' preferences, and \emph{control}, which allows
  changing the sets of voters and parties.
  We consider multiple bribery types, presenting polynomial-time algorithms for some, while proving NP-hardness for others.
  For control, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for control by adding and deleting voters. In contrast, control by adding and deleting parties, we show, is either impossible (i.e., the problem is immune to control) or computationally hard, in particular, W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of parties that can be added or deleted.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) model trading, known for its role in protecting data privacy, faces a major challenge: information asymmetry. This issue can lead to model deception, a problem that current literature has not fully solved, where the seller misrepresents model performance to earn more. We propose a game-theoretic approach, adding a verification step in the ML model market that lets buyers check model quality before buying. However, this method can be expensive and offers imperfect information, making it harder for buyers to decide. Our analysis reveals that a seller might probabilistically conduct model deception considering the chance of model verification. This deception probability decreases with the verification accuracy and increases with the verification cost. To maximize seller payoff, we further design optimal pricing schemes accounting for heterogeneous buyers' strategic behaviors. Interestingly, we find that reducing information asymmetry benefits both the seller and buyer. Meanwhile, protecting buyer order information doesn't improve the payoff for the buyer or the seller. These findings highlight the importance of reducing information asymmetry in ML model trading and open new directions for future research.

Abstract: Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent behavior, such as procrastination or abandonment of long-term goals, arises when agents evaluate immediate outcomes disproportionately higher than future ones. This leads to globally suboptimal behavior, where plans are frequently revised or abandoned entirely. In the influential model of Kleinberg and Oren (2014) such behavior is modeled by a present-biased agent navigating a task graph toward a goal, making locally optimal decisions at each step based on discounted future costs. As a result, the agent may repeatedly deviate from initial plans. Recent work by Belova et al. (2024) introduced a two-agent extension of this model, where a fully-aware principal attempts to guide the present-biased agent through a specific set of critical tasks without causing abandonment. This captures a rich class of principal-agent dynamics in behavioral settings.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive algorithmic characterization of this problem. We analyze its computational complexity through the framework of parameterized algorithms, focusing on graph parameters that naturally emerge in this setting, such as treewidth, vertex cover, and feedback vertex set. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when parameterized by the treewidth of the task graph and the number of distinct (v,t)-path costs. Our algorithm encaptures several input settings, such as bounded edge costs and restricted task graph structure. We demonstrate that our main result yields efficient algorithms for a number of such configurations.
  We complement this with tight hardness results, that highlight the extreme difficulty of the problem even on simplest graphs with bounded number of nodes and constant parameter values, and motivate our choice of parameters. We delineate tractable and intractable regions of the problem landscape, which include answers to open questions of Belova et al. (2024).

Motivation: 经典随机回合游戏每次访问节点时随机分配控制权，本文研究两种仅分配一次控制权的自然变体下游戏求解复杂度。

Method: 研究两种控制权分配机制，分析三种目标（可达性、奇偶性、能量）下计算获胜概率的复杂度，针对第二种机制提出随机近似方案。

Result: 定性问题在所有变体和目标下是NL - 完全的；定量问题中，第一种机制下判定最大者获胜概率是否至少为给定阈值是PSPACE - 完全的，第二种机制下计算精确获胜概率是sharp - P - 完全的。

Conclusion: 给出了不同机制和目标下游戏求解复杂度结果，针对第二种机制的硬度结果提出随机近似方案并验证其快速收敛性。

Abstract: We study the complexity of solving two-player infinite duration games played on a fixed finite graph, where the control of a node is not predetermined but rather assigned randomly. In classic random-turn games, control of each node is assigned randomly every time the node is visited during a play. In this work, we study two natural variants of this where control of each node is assigned only once: (i) control is assigned randomly during a play when a node is visited for the first time and does not change for the rest of the play and (ii) control is assigned a priori before the game starts for every node by independent coin tosses and then the game is played. We investigate the complexity of computing the winning probability with three kinds of objectives-reachability, parity, and energy. We show that the qualitative questions on all variants and all objectives are NL-complete. For the quantitative questions, we show that deciding whether the maximiser can win with probability at least a given threshold for every objective is PSPACE-complete under the first mechanism, and that computing the exact winning probability for every objective is sharp-P-complete under the second. To complement our hardness results for the second mechanism, we propose randomised approximation schemes that efficiently estimate the winning probability for all three objectives, assuming a bounded number of parity colours and unary-encoded weights for energy objectives, and we empirically demonstrate their fast convergence.

Conclusion: FastLane实现可扩展低延迟检索，为多语言、多模态和长上下文检索开辟道路。

Abstract: Late-interaction retrieval models like ColBERT achieve superior accuracy by enabling token-level interactions, but their computational cost hinders scalability and integration with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS). We introduce FastLane, a novel retrieval framework that dynamically routes queries to their most informative representations, eliminating redundant token comparisons. FastLane employs a learnable routing mechanism optimized alongside the embedding model, leveraging self-attention and differentiable selection to maximize efficiency. Our approach reduces computational complexity by up to 30x while maintaining competitive retrieval performance. By bridging late-interaction models with ANNS, FastLane enables scalable, low-latency retrieval, making it feasible for large-scale applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question-answering platforms. This work opens pathways for multi-lingual, multi-modal, and long-context retrieval, pushing the frontier of efficient and adaptive information retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential for usage in sequential recommendation tasks through text-only models, which combine advanced prompt design, contrastive alignment, and fine-tuning on downstream domain-specific data. While effective, these approaches overlook the rich visual information present in many real-world recommendation scenarios, particularly in e-commerce. This paper proposes PixRec - a vision-language framework that incorporates both textual attributes and product images into the recommendation pipeline. Our architecture leverages a vision-language model backbone capable of jointly processing image-text sequences, maintaining a dual-tower structure and mixed training objective while aligning multi-modal feature projections for both item-item and user-item interactions. Using the Amazon Reviews dataset augmented with product images, our experiments demonstrate $3\times$ and 40% improvements in top-rank and top-10 rank accuracy over text-only recommenders respectively, indicating that visual features can help distinguish items with similar textual descriptions. Our work outlines future directions for scaling multi-modal recommenders training, enhancing visual-text feature fusion, and evaluating inference-time performance. This work takes a step toward building software systems utilizing visual information in sequential recommendation for real-world applications like e-commerce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统‘总是检索’的静态方法有高计算开销和推理延迟问题，对高吞吐量生产部署有影响。

Method: 引入L - RAG，通过基于熵的门控实现分层上下文管理，采用两层架构，当模型预测熵超过阈值时触发昂贵的块检索。

Result: 实验表明L - RAG可调节准确率和效率平衡，保守阈值下准确率达78.2%且检索减少8%；平衡阈值下检索减少26%；检索延迟超500ms时每查询节省80 - 210ms；熵分布分析验证熵可作为可靠不确定性信号。

Conclusion: L - RAG是无需训练的实用方法，为系统架构师提供平衡准确率和吞吐量的配置选项。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for grounding Large Language Model outputs in factual knowledge, effectively mitigating hallucinations. However, conventional RAG systems operate under a "retrieve-always" assumption, querying vector databases for every input regardless of query complexity. This static approach incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency, particularly problematic for high-throughput production deployments. We introduce L-RAG (Lazy Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an adaptive framework that implements hierarchical context management through entropy-based gating. L-RAG employs a two-tier architecture: queries are first processed with a compact document summary, and expensive chunk retrieval is triggered only when the model's predictive entropy exceeds a calibrated threshold, signaling genuine uncertainty. Through experiments on SQuAD 2.0 (N=500) using the Phi-2 model, we demonstrate that L-RAG provides a tunable accuracy-efficiency trade-off: at a conservative threshold (tau=0.5), L-RAG achieves 78.2% accuracy, matching Standard RAG (77.8%), with 8% retrieval reduction; at a balanced threshold (tau=1.0), retrieval reduction increases to 26% with modest accuracy trade-off (76.0%). Latency analysis shows that L-RAG saves 80-210ms per query when retrieval latency exceeds 500ms. Analysis of entropy distributions reveals statistically significant separation (p < 0.001) between correct predictions (H=1.72) and errors (H=2.20), validating entropy as a reliable uncertainty signal. L-RAG offers a practical, training-free approach toward more efficient RAG deployment, providing system architects with a configurable knob to balance accuracy and throughput requirements.

Method: 结合基于SPARQL的规则预过滤和基于RDF2vec嵌入的相似度计算的混合图匹配方法。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为数字孪生网络的增强发现、重用和自动配置提供了基础。

Abstract: Although the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standard provides a structured and machine-readable representation of industrial assets, their semantic comparability remains a major challenge, particularly when different vocabularies and modeling practices are used. Engineering would benefit from retrieving existing AAS models that are similar to the target in order to reuse submodels, parameters, and metadata. In practice, however, heterogeneous vocabularies and divergent modeling conventions hinder automated, content-level comparison across AAS. This paper proposes a hybrid graph matching approach to enable semantics-aware comparison of Digital Twin representations. The method combines rule-based pre-filtering using SPARQL with embedding-based similarity calculation leveraging RDF2vec to capture both structural and semantic relationships between AAS models. This contribution provides a foundation for enhanced discovery, reuse, and automated configuration in Digital Twin networks.

Abstract: Leveraging the vast open-world knowledge and understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop general-purpose, semantically-aware recommender systems has emerged as a pivotal research direction in generative recommendation. However, existing methods face bottlenecks in constructing item identifiers. Text-based methods introduce LLMs' vast output space, leading to hallucination, while methods based on Semantic IDs (SIDs) encounter a semantic gap between SIDs and LLMs' native vocabulary, requiring costly vocabulary expansion and alignment training. To address this, this paper introduces Term IDs (TIDs), defined as a set of semantically rich and standardized textual keywords, to serve as robust item identifiers. We propose GRLM, a novel framework centered on TIDs, employs Context-aware Term Generation to convert item's metadata into standardized TIDs and utilizes Integrative Instruction Fine-tuning to collaboratively optimize term internalization and sequential recommendation. Additionally, Elastic Identifier Grounding is designed for robust item mapping. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GRLM significantly outperforms baselines across multiple scenarios, pointing a promising direction for generalizable and high-performance generative recommendation systems.

Result: EBR系统上线，应用于多个用例，通过A/B测试显示关键指标有显著提升。

Conclusion: 构建的EBR系统有效，能为Airbnb搜索提供高质量候选房源，提升业务指标。

Abstract: The goal of Airbnb search is to match guests with the ideal accommodation that fits their travel needs. This is a challenging problem, as popular search locations can have around a hundred thousand available homes, and guests themselves have a wide variety of preferences. Furthermore, the launch of new product features, such as \textit{flexible date search,} significantly increased the number of eligible homes per search query. As such, there is a need for a sophisticated retrieval system which can provide high-quality candidates with low latency in a way that integrates with the overall ranking stack.
  This paper details our journey to build an efficient and high-quality retrieval system for Airbnb search. We describe the key unique challenges we encountered when implementing an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) system for a two sided marketplace like Airbnb -- such as the dynamic nature of the inventory, a lengthy user funnel with multiple stages, and a variety of product surfaces. We cover unique insights when modeling the retrieval problem, how to build robust evaluation systems, and design choices for online serving. The EBR system was launched to production and powers several use-cases such as regular search, flexible date and promotional emails for marketing campaigns. The system demonstrated statistically-significant improvements in key metrics, such as booking conversion, via A/B testing.

Result: 在两个公司文件问答基准测试中，FinCards大幅提高早期排名检索效果，降低排名方差，且无需模型微调或不可预测的推理预算。

Conclusion: FinCards框架在财务问答证据选择方面表现出色，有良好实际应用价值。

Abstract: Financial question answering (QA) over long corporate filings requires evidence to satisfy strict constraints on entities, financial metrics, fiscal periods, and numeric values. However, existing LLM-based rerankers primarily optimize semantic relevance, leading to unstable rankings and opaque decisions on long documents. We propose FinCards, a structured reranking framework that reframes financial evidence selection as constraint satisfaction under a finance-aware schema. FinCards represents filing chunks and questions using aligned schema fields (entities, metrics, periods, and numeric spans), enabling deterministic field-level matching. Evidence is selected via a multi-stage tournament reranking with stability-aware aggregation, producing auditable decision traces. Across two corporate filing QA benchmarks, FinCards substantially improves early-rank retrieval over both lexical and LLM-based reranking baselines, while reducing ranking variance, without requiring model fine-tuning or unpredictable inference budgets.

Motivation: 多向量嵌入模型存储开销大，限制可扩展性，需解决此问题。

Method: 引入ReinPool强化学习框架，通过逆检索目标和基于NDCG的奖励进行训练。

Result: 在Vidore V2基准上，将多向量表示压缩746 - 1249倍，恢复76 - 81%检索性能，比静态均值池化基线NDCG@3提高22 - 33%。

Conclusion: 学习选择方法明显优于启发式聚合方法。

Abstract: Multi-vector embedding models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for document retrieval, preserving fine-grained visual and textual details through token-level representations. However, this expressiveness comes at a staggering cost: storing embeddings for every token inflates index sizes by over $1000\times$ compared to single-vector approaches, severely limiting scalability. We introduce \textbf{ReinPool}, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to dynamically filter and pool multi-vector embeddings into compact, retrieval-optimized representations. By training with an inverse retrieval objective and NDCG-based rewards, ReinPool identifies and retains only the most discriminative vectors without requiring manual importance annotations. On the Vidore V2 benchmark across three vision-language embedding models, ReinPool compresses multi-vector representations by $746$--$1249\times$ into single vectors while recovering 76--81\% of full multi-vector retrieval performance. Compared to static mean pooling baselines, ReinPool achieves 22--33\% absolute NDCG@3 improvement, demonstrating that learned selection significantly outperforms heuristic aggregation.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的大量实验显示，BiGEL比十个有竞争力的方法更有效。

Conclusion: 提出的BiGEL方法能有效解决多行为多任务推荐问题。

Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation (MBR) aims to improve the performance w.r.t. the target behavior (i.e., purchase) by leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., click, favourite). However, in real-world scenarios, a recommendation method often needs to process different types of behaviors and generate personalized lists for each task (i.e., each behavior type). Such a new recommendation problem is referred to as multi-behavior multi-task recommendation (MMR). So far, the most powerful MBR methods usually model multi-behavior interactions using a cascading graph paradigm. Although significant progress has been made in optimizing the performance of the target behavior, it often neglects the performance of auxiliary behaviors. To compensate for the deficiencies of the cascading paradigm, we propose a novel solution for MMR, i.e., behavior-informed graph embedding learning (BiGEL). Specifically, we first obtain a set of behavior-aware embeddings by using a cascading graph paradigm. Subsequently, we introduce three key modules to improve the performance of the model. The cascading gated feedback (CGF) module enables a feedback-driven optimization process by integrating feedback from the target behavior to refine the auxiliary behaviors preferences. The global context enhancement (GCE) module integrates the global context to maintain the user's overall preferences, preventing the loss of key preferences due to individual behavior graph modeling. Finally, the contrastive preference alignment (CPA) module addresses the potential changes in user preferences during the cascading process by aligning the preferences of the target behaviors with the global preferences through contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our BiGEL compared with ten very competitive methods.

Result: RLPO相比强点式和列表式基线提高了NDCG@k，且随着列表长度增加保持稳健。

Conclusion: RLPO是解决长上下文评论排序问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Review ranking is pivotal in e-commerce for prioritizing diagnostic and authentic feedback from the deluge of user-generated content. While large language models have improved semantic assessment, existing ranking paradigms face a persistent trade-off in long-context settings. Pointwise scoring is efficient but often fails to account for list-level interactions, leading to miscalibrated top-$k$ rankings. Listwise approaches can leverage global context, yet they are computationally expensive and become unstable as candidate lists grow. To address this, we propose Residual Listwise Preference Optimization (RLPO), which formulates ranking as listwise representation-level residual correction over a strong pointwise LLM scorer. RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark for long-context review ranking with human verification. Experiments show RLPO improves NDCG@k over strong pointwise and listwise baselines and remains robust as list length increases.

Result: 利用该数据为最先进大语言模型的互文性检索和分类任务建立了基线。

Conclusion: Loci Similes基准能促进拉丁语互文性检测新方法的开发。

Abstract: Tracing connections between historical texts is an important part of intertextual research, enabling scholars to reconstruct the virtual library of a writer and identify the sources influencing their creative process. These intertextual links manifest in diverse forms, ranging from direct verbatim quotations to subtle allusions and paraphrases disguised by morphological variation. Language models offer a promising path forward due to their capability of capturing semantic similarity beyond lexical overlap. However, the development of new methods for this task is held back by the scarcity of standardized benchmarks and easy-to-use datasets. We address this gap by introducing Loci Similes, a benchmark for Latin intertextuality detection comprising of a curated dataset of ~172k text segments containing 545 expert-verified parallels linking Late Antique authors to a corpus of classical authors. Using this data, we establish baselines for retrieval and classification of intertextualities with state-of-the-art LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有顺序用户行为建模用于CTR预测存在“Attention Sink”、静态查询假设和刚性视图聚合三个瓶颈。

Method: 提出GAP - Net框架，包含Adaptive Sparse - Gated Attention、Gated Cascading Query Calibration和Context - Gated Denoising Fusion三个机制。

Result: 在工业数据集上实验表明，GAP - Net比现有基线有显著提升，对交互噪声和意图漂移有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAP - Net能有效解决顺序用户行为建模用于CTR预测的问题。

Abstract: Sequential user behavior modeling is pivotal for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction yet is hindered by three intrinsic bottlenecks: (1) the "Attention Sink" phenomenon, where standard Softmax compels the model to allocate probability mass to noisy behaviors; (2) the Static Query Assumption, which overlooks dynamic shifts in user intent driven by real-time contexts; and (3) Rigid View Aggregation, which fails to adaptively weight heterogeneous temporal signals according to the decision context. To bridge these gaps, we propose GAP-Net (Gated Adaptive Progressive Network), a unified framework establishing a "Triple Gating" architecture to progressively refine information from micro-level features to macro-level views. GAP-Net operates through three integrated mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Sparse-Gated Attention (ASGA) employs micro-level gating to enforce sparsity, effectively suppressing massive noise activations; (2) Gated Cascading Query Calibration (GCQC) dynamically aligns user intent by bridging real-time triggers and long-term memories via a meso-level cascading channel; and (3) Context-Gated Denoising Fusion (CGDF) performs macro-level modulation to orchestrate the aggregation of multi-view sequences. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate that GAP-Net achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, exhibiting superior robustness against interaction noise and intent drift.

By combining local language models for semantic understanding with deterministic algorithms for reliability, AptaFind operates without cloud dependencies or subscription barriers. Validation across 300 University of Texas Aptamer Database targets demonstrates 84 % with some literature found, 84 % with curated research leads, and 79 % with a direct sequence extraction, at a laptop-compute rate of over 900 targets an hour. The platform proves that even when direct sequence extraction fails, automation can still deliver the actionable intelligence researchers need by rapidly narrowing the search to high quality references.

### [133] [Tree-Preconditioned Differentiable Optimization and Axioms as Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06036)
*Yuexin Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出将随机效用模型（RUM）的公理结构嵌入深度神经网络的可微框架，利用组合结构推导新求解器，可解决先前无法解决的问题，减少基于惩罚方法的结构过拟合并提升泛化能力。

Result: 预条件器实现超线性收敛，可处理先前无法解决的问题规模，新范式消除结构过拟合，模型可联合训练、具有可证明的合理性且能在稀疏数据上泛化。

Conclusion: 所提的“Axioms - as - Layers”范式有效，改善了模型性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable framework that embeds the axiomatic structure of Random Utility Models (RUM) directly into deep neural networks. Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively "whitens" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this "Axioms-as-Layers" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail.

Conclusion: CrossTrafficLLM统一预测和描述生成，为生成式交通智能提供更具可解释性和可操作性的方法，对现代智能交通系统应用有重要优势。

Abstract: While accurate traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), effectively communicating predicted conditions via natural language for human-centric decision support remains a challenge and is often handled separately. To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, specifically targeting conditional abnormal event summaries. We tackle the core challenge of aligning quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a unified architecture. This design allows generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy while ensuring generated reports are directly informed by the forecast. Technically, a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network is employed to effectively merge high-level semantic information with the traffic network structure. Evaluated on the BJTT dataset, CrossTrafficLLM demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality. By unifying prediction and description generation, CrossTrafficLLM delivers a more interpretable, and actionable approach to generative traffic intelligence, offering significant advantages for modern ITS applications.

Motivation: 长上下文推理需求下，现有模型中间结果存储需求超FPGA内存容量，需找到在FPGA上实现长上下文推理的方法。

Method: 采用分块FFT卷积方法，通过分块和重叠相加重建实现长序列卷积。

Result: 能在Alveo U200 FPGA上实现450K长度序列与450K长度滤波器的卷积，吞吐量与块大小成正比，最长序列性能仅下降7%。

Conclusion: 精心的内存管理可在边缘FPGA上部署长上下文原语而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The need for long-context reasoning has led to alternative neural network architectures besides Transformers and self-attention, a popular model being Hyena, which employs causal 1D-convolutions implemented with FFTs. Long convolutions enable efficient global context mixing, but requirements for intermediate results exceed the 2-3 MB Block RAM capacity of FPGAs. We present a chunked FFT convolution approach enabling 450K length sequence by 450K length filter convolutions on an Alveo U200 FPGA with 2.8 MB BRAM through chunking and overlap-add reconstruction. We find that throughput scales proportionally with chunk size while degrading minimally by 7% for our longest sequences, demonstrating that careful memory management enables deployment of long-context primitives on edge FPGAs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We describe an exact algorithm for solving linear systems $Hx=b$ where $H$ is the Hessian of a deep net. The method computes Hessian-inverse-vector products without storing the Hessian or its inverse in time and storage that scale linearly in the number of layers. Compared to the naive approach of first computing the Hessian, then solving the linear system, which takes storage that's quadratic in the number of parameters and cubically many operations, our Hessian-inverse-vector product method scales roughly like Pearlmutter's algorithm for computing Hessian-vector products.

Method: 借鉴HRM和TRM，维护可学习的潜在令牌，通过紧凑的递归网络迭代细化，递归处理层更新推理状态并细化答案令牌。

Result: 未提及具体结果

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论

Abstract: We introduce Tab-TRM (Tabular-Tiny Recursive Model), a network architecture that adapts the recursive latent reasoning paradigm of Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) to insurance modeling. Drawing inspiration from both the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) and its simplified successor TRM, the Tab-TRM model makes predictions by reasoning over the input features. It maintains two learnable latent tokens - an answer token and a reasoning state - that are iteratively refined by a compact, parameter-efficient recursive network. The recursive processing layer repeatedly updates the reasoning state given the full token sequence and then refines the answer token, in close analogy with iterative insurance pricing schemes. Conceptually, Tab-TRM bridges classical actuarial workflows - iterative generalized linear model fitting and minimum-bias calibration - on the one hand, and modern machine learning, in terms of Gradient Boosting Machines, on the other.

Abstract: The field of algorithms with predictions aims to improve algorithm performance by integrating machine learning predictions into algorithm design. A central question in this area is how predictions can improve performance, and a key aspect of this analysis is the role of prediction accuracy. In this context, prediction accuracy is defined as a guaranteed probability that an instance drawn from the distribution belongs to the predicted set. As a performance measure that incorporates prediction accuracy, we focus on the distributionally-robust competitive ratio (DRCR), introduced by Sun et al.~(ICML 2024). The DRCR is defined as the expected ratio between the algorithm's cost and the optimal cost, where the expectation is taken over the worst-case instance distribution that satisfies the given prediction and accuracy requirement. A known structural property is that, for any fixed algorithm, the DRCR decreases linearly as prediction accuracy increases. Building on this result, we establish that the optimal DRCR value (i.e., the infimum over all algorithms) is a monotone and concave function of prediction accuracy. We further generalize the DRCR framework to a multiple-prediction setting and show that monotonicity and concavity are preserved in this setting. Finally, we apply our results to the ski rental problem, a benchmark problem in online optimization, to identify the conditions on prediction accuracies required for the optimal DRCR to attain a target value. Moreover, we provide a method for computing the critical accuracy, defined as the minimum accuracy required for the optimal DRCR to strictly improve upon the performance attainable without any accuracy guarantee.

*Jinwoong Kim,Sangjin Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现有多元时间序列模型解释方法有局限，提出GS - SHAP方法并在多领域评估，表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列模型结合变量交互和时间动态的方式不明，现有时间序列SHAP变体独立处理特征和时间轴，会碎片化结构信号。

Method: 提出GroupSegment SHAP (GS - SHAP)，基于跨变量依赖和时间分布变化构建解释单元，用Shapley归因量化贡献。

Result: 在四个领域进行评估，相比基线将基于删除的忠实度（DeltaAUC）平均提高约1.7倍，平均减少约40%运行时间；金融案例能识别关键市场变量的可解释多元时间交互。

Conclusion: GS - SHAP在多元时间序列模型解释方面表现良好，提高了忠实度并减少运行时间。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series models achieve strong predictive performance in healthcare, industry, energy, and finance, but how they combine cross-variable interactions with temporal dynamics remains unclear. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are widely used for interpretation. However, existing time-series variants typically treat the feature and time axes independently, fragmenting structural signals formed jointly by multiple variables over specific intervals. We propose GroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP), which constructs explanatory units as group-segment players based on cross-variable dependence and distribution shifts over time, and then quantifies each unit's contribution via Shapley attribution. We evaluate GS-SHAP across four real-world domains: human activity recognition, power-system forecasting, medical signal analysis, and financial time series, and compare it with KernelSHAP, TimeSHAP, SequenceSHAP, WindowSHAP, and TSHAP. GS-SHAP improves deletion-based faithfulness (DeltaAUC) by about 1.7x on average over time-series SHAP baselines, while reducing wall-clock runtime by about 40 percent on average under matched perturbation budgets. A financial case study shows that GS-SHAP identifies interpretable multivariate-temporal interactions among key market variables during high-volatility regimes.

Conclusion: 理论为上下文学习等提供统一概率解释，有稳定性和样本效率保证，阐明不确定性动态作用，实验验证理论定性预测。

Abstract: We present a theory-first framework that interprets inference-time adaptation in large language models (LLMs) as online Bayesian state estimation. Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.
  This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.
  The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts. Minimal illustrative experiments corroborate the qualitative predictions of the theory.

TL;DR: 研究数据集污染与大语言模型训练流程中后训练阶段的相互作用，发现污染影响及后训练方法的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究数据集污染在大语言模型训练后阶段的影响。

Method: 从Qwen2.5和Gemma3的干净检查点开始，在预训练数据集中注入测试项目，对比污染和干净模型在预训练后以及监督微调、强化学习后训练方法后的表现。

Result: 污染导致性能提升逐渐减弱；监督微调仅提升污染任务分数，强化学习也提升未污染任务分数；模型规模会放大这些趋势。

Conclusion: 强调后训练后进行污染审计的必要性，基于强化学习的后训练可缓解污染相关的高估问题。

Abstract: We present a controlled study of how dataset contamination interacts with the post-training stages now standard in large language model training pipelines. Starting from clean checkpoints of Qwen2.5 (0.5B/1.5B) and Gemma3 (1B/4B), we inject five copies of GSM8K and MBPP test items into the first 2B tokens of an otherwise 25B token extended pre-training dataset. We then compare the contaminated and clean models both immediately after pre-training and again after two popular post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). The applied post-training steps do not have any contamination. Across math and coding benchmarks, we find three consistent patterns: (i) Contamination causes performance spikes that are gradually diminished with continued pre-training. After even 25B tokens the apparent performance inflation of contamination can become close to zero. (ii) Both SFT and GRPO resurface the leaked information, but with different external validity: SFT inflates scores only on the contaminated tasks, whereas GRPO also inflates performance on uncontaminated counterparts (GSMPlus, HumanEval). (iii) Model scale amplifies these tendencies, larger Supervised Fine Tuned models memorize more, while larger GRPO models translate leakage into more generalizable capabilities. Our results underscore the need for contamination audits \emph{after} post-training and suggest that RL-based post-training, although not immune, can help alleviate contamination-related over-estimation problems.

Abstract: Bushfires are among the most destructive natural hazards in Australia, causing significant ecological, economic, and social damage. Accurate prediction of bushfire intensity is therefore essential for effective disaster preparedness and response. This study examines the predictive capability of spatio-temporal environmental data for identifying high-risk bushfire zones across Australia. We integrated historical fire events from NASA FIRMS, daily meteorological observations from Meteostat, and vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Google Earth Engine for the period 2015-2023. After harmonizing the datasets using spatial and temporal joins, we evaluated several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and an ensemble classifier. Under a binary classification framework distinguishing 'low' and 'high' fire risk, the ensemble approach achieved an accuracy of 87%. The results demonstrate that combining multi-source environmental features with advanced machine learning techniques can produce reliable bushfire intensity predictions, supporting more informed and timely disaster management.

Our benchmark spans text, audio, image, and video modalities, drawing from carefully sampled public datasets with fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility and minimize train test leakage. Instead of simple scoring, our framework aggregates multimodal judgments, analyzes the quality and reasoning consistency of model outputs, and generates diagnostic feedback. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Gemini 2.5, Phi 4, and Qwen 2.5, across 280 multimodal samples and compare judge model assessments with human annotators. Results show strong alignment between the Judge Model and human scores, demonstrating its potential as a scalable, interpretable evaluation pipeline for future multimodal AI research.

Conclusion: 提供了学习速度控制的规范且具生物合理性的解释，将自我调节学习、努力分配和情景记忆估计统一在数学框架中。

Abstract: Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.

Conclusion: AIConfigurator能快速探索从集群拓扑到引擎特定标志的巨大设计空间。

Abstract: Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production systems is increasingly difficult due to dynamic workloads, stringent latency/throughput targets, and a rapidly expanding configuration space. This complexity spans not only distributed parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/expert) but also intricate framework-specific runtime parameters such as those concerning the enablement of CUDA graphs, available KV-cache memory fractions, and maximum token capacity, which drastically impact performance. The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling. AIConfigurator combines (1) a methodology that decomposes inference into analytically modelable primitives - GEMM, attention, communication, and memory operations while capturing framework-specific scheduling dynamics; (2) a calibrated kernel-level performance database for these primitives across a wide range of hardware platforms and popular open-weights models (GPT-OSS, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLama, Mistral); and (3) an abstraction layer that automatically resolves optimal launch parameters for the target backend, seamlessly integrating into production-grade orchestration systems. Evaluation on production LLM serving workloads demonstrates that AIConfigurator identifies superior serving configurations that improve performance by up to 40% for dense models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and 50% for MoE architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), while completing searches within 30 seconds on average. Enabling the rapid exploration of vast design spaces - from cluster topology down to engine specific flags.

Abstract: This paper presents a large-scale stress test of machine learning systems using structured mathematical data as a benchmark. We evaluate the robustness of tree-based classifiers at an unprecedented scale, utilizing ten billion deterministic samples and five billion adversarial counterexamples. Our framework introduces three primary contributions:
  first, a high-throughput pipeline that reformulates Pythagorean triple generation into a single-parameter index stream, significantly improving computational efficiency over classical methods;
  second, the Hypothesis-driven Negative Dataset (HND), which categorizes nine classes of adversarial attacks designed to exploit both arithmetic precision and structural patterns; and
  third, a fault-tolerant infrastructure for reliable large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that while LightGBM achieves 99.99% accuracy, feature attribution reveals that the model prioritizes underlying quadratic patterns over direct algebraic verification.
  These findings suggest that learned heuristics can effectively identify structural representations in numerical data, potentially serving as efficient preprocessors for formal verification methods.

Result: 在CIFAR - 10N等多个数据集上评估L2CU，证明其能有效提升人机合作分类效果。

Conclusion: L2CU是一种与模型无关的解决方案，可有效改善人机合作分类。

Abstract: Recent research highlights the potential of machine learning models to learn to complement (L2C) human strengths; however, generalizing this capability to unseen users remains a significant challenge. Existing L2C methods oversimplify interaction between human and AI by relying on a single, global user model that neglects individual user variability, leading to suboptimal cooperative performance. Addressing this, we introduce L2CU, a novel L2C framework for human-AI cooperative classification with unseen users. Given sparse and noisy user annotations, L2CU identifies representative annotator profiles capturing distinct labeling patterns. By matching unseen users to these profiles, L2CU leverages profile-specific models to complement the user and achieve superior joint accuracy. We evaluate L2CU on datasets (CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-10H, Fashion-MNIST-H, Chaoyang and AgNews), demonstrating its effectiveness as a model-agnostic solution for improving human-AI cooperative classification.

Abstract: Solving increasingly complex problems with large language models (LLMs) necessitates a move beyond individual models and towards multi-model systems that can effectively collaborate. While text has traditionally served as the medium for inter-model communication, a richer and more efficient exchange is possible if models can access each other's internal states directly. In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models. Our work represents a significant step towards a future where models can fluidly share knowledge and capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的路况交通时间预测方法依赖数据密集型拥堵模型或简单启发式方法，限制了可扩展性和在工程工作流程中的实际应用，因此需要开发新方法。

Method: 在随机森林框架中整合开放道路网络数据、速度约束和稀疏控制/转弯特征，以修正最短路径遍历时间基线的偏差；构建可驾驶网络、求解Dijkstra路线、推导稀疏操作特征并使用有限高质量参考时间训练回归集成模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为交通工程提供实用折中方案，能在大都市规模上保持点对点精度，降低资源需求，在拥堵数据不可获取或成本过高时提供可靠性能估计。

Abstract: Accurate roadway travel-time prediction is foundational to transportation systems analysis, yet widespread reliance on either data-intensive congestion models or overly naïve heuristics limits scalability and practical adoption in engineering workflows. This paper develops a lightweight estimator for minimally-congested car travel times that integrates open road-network data, speed constraints, and sparse control/turn features within a random forest framework to correct bias from shortest-path traversal-time baselines. Using an urban testbed, the pipeline: (i) constructs drivable networks from volunteered geographic data; (ii) solves Dijkstra routes minimizing edge traversal time; (iii) derives sparse operational features (signals, stops, crossings, yield, roundabouts; left/right/slight/U-turn counts); and (iv) trains a regression ensemble on limited high-quality reference times to generalize predictions beyond the training set. Out-of-sample evaluation demonstrates marked improvements over traversal-time baselines across mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error, relative bias, and explained variance, with no significant mean bias under minimally congested conditions and consistent k-fold stability indicating negligible overfitting. The resulting approach offers a practical middle ground for transportation engineering: it preserves point-to-point fidelity at metropolitan scale, reduces resource requirements, and supplies defensible performance estimates where congestion feeds are inaccessible or cost-prohibitive, supporting planning, accessibility, and network performance applications under low-traffic operating regimes.

Abstract: Automatic Identification System (AIS) data are vital for maritime domain awareness, yet they often suffer from domain shifts, data sparsity, and class imbalance, which hinder the performance of predictive models. In this paper, we propose a robust data augmentation method, AISCycleGen, based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN), which is tailored for AIS datasets. Unlike traditional methods, AISCycleGen leverages unpaired domain translation to generate high-fidelity synthetic AIS data sequences without requiring paired source-target data. The framework employs a 1D convolutional generator with adaptive noise injection to preserve the spatiotemporal structure of AIS trajectories, enhancing the diversity and realism of the generated data. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply AISCycleGen to several baseline regression models, showing improvements in performance across various maritime domains. The results indicate that AISCycleGen outperforms contemporary GAN-based augmentation techniques, achieving a PSNR value of 30.5 and an FID score of 38.9. These findings underscore AISCycleGen's potential as an effective and generalizable solution for augmenting AIS datasets, improving downstream model performance in real-world maritime intelligence applications.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful approach for robotic control, demonstrating superior expressiveness in modeling multimodal action distributions compared to conventional policy networks. However, their integration with online reinforcement learning remains challenging due to fundamental incompatibilities between diffusion model training objectives and standard RL policy improvement mechanisms. This paper presents the first comprehensive review and empirical analysis of current Online Diffusion Policy Reinforcement Learning (Online DPRL) algorithms for scalable robotic control systems. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into four distinct families -- Action-Gradient, Q-Weighting, Proximity-Based, and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) methods -- based on their policy improvement mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on a unified NVIDIA Isaac Lab benchmark encompassing 12 diverse robotic tasks, we systematically evaluate representative algorithms across five critical dimensions: task diversity, parallelization capability, diffusion step scalability, cross-embodiment generalization, and environmental robustness. Our analysis identifies key findings regarding the fundamental trade-offs inherent in each algorithmic family, particularly concerning sample efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we reveal critical computational and algorithmic bottlenecks that currently limit the practical deployment of online DPRL. Based on these findings, we provide concrete guidelines for algorithm selection tailored to specific operational constraints and outline promising future research directions to advance the field toward more general and scalable robotic learning systems.

Conclusion: 将神经科学第一原理嵌入到学习表示中，能够赋予其内在的通用性，对通用脑机接口至关重要，代码将公开。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: This work introduces Adaptive Density Fields (ADF), a geometric attention framework that formulates spatial aggregation as a query-conditioned, metric-induced attention operator in continuous space. By reinterpreting spatial influence as geometry-preserving attention grounded in physical distance, ADF bridges concepts from adaptive kernel methods and attention mechanisms. Scalability is achieved via FAISS-accelerated inverted file indices, treating approximate nearest-neighbor search as an intrinsic component of the attention mechanism. We demonstrate the framework through a case study on aircraft trajectory analysis in the Chengdu region, extracting trajectory-conditioned Zones of Influence (ZOI) to reveal recurrent airspace structures and localized deviations.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the major cause of death globally, calling for predictive models that not only handle diverse and high-dimensional biomedical signals but also maintain interpretability and privacy. We create a single multimodal learning framework that integrates cross modal transformers with graph neural networks and causal representation learning to measure personalized CVD risk. The model combines genomic variation, cardiac MRI, ECG waveforms, wearable streams, and structured EHR data to predict risk while also implementing causal invariance constraints across different clinical subpopulations.
  To maintain transparency, we employ SHAP based feature attribution, counterfactual explanations and causal latent alignment for understandable risk factors. Besides, we position the design in a federated, privacy, preserving optimization protocol and establish rules for convergence, calibration and uncertainty quantification under distributional shift. Experimental studies based on large-scale biobank and multi institutional datasets reveal state discrimination and robustness, exhibiting fair performance across demographic strata and clinically distinct cohorts. This study paves the way for a principled approach to clinically trustworthy, interpretable and privacy respecting CVD prediction at the population level.

Result: 将该模块集成到多个先进模型中，性能持续提升，综合统计分析和消融实验验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 所提的RainBalance框架可有效缓解降水临近预报中的不平衡问题。

Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) station-based Precipitation Nowcasting aims to predict rainfall within the next 0-6 hours by leveraging a GNSS station's historical observations of precipitation, GNSS-PWV, and related meteorological variables, which is crucial for disaster mitigation and real-time decision-making. In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue. We integrate this module into multiple state-of-the-art models and observe consistent performance gains. Comprehensive statistical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 所提出方法结合了元学习和大语言模型优势，为回归任务提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Meta-learning methods for regression like Neural (Diffusion) Processes achieve impressive results, but with these models it can be difficult to incorporate expert prior knowledge and information contained in metadata. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on giant corpora including varied real-world regression datasets alongside their descriptions and metadata, leading to impressive performance on a range of downstream tasks. Recent work has extended this to regression tasks and is able to leverage such prior knowledge and metadata, achieving surprisingly good performance, but this still rarely matches dedicated meta-learning methods. Here we introduce a general method for sampling from a product-of-experts of a diffusion or flow matching model and an `expert' with binned probability density; we apply this to combine neural diffusion processes with LLM token probabilities for regression (which may incorporate textual knowledge), exceeding the empirical performance of either alone.

Abstract: Supporting Go/No-Go decisions prior to launch requires assessing real-time telemetry data against redline limits established during the design qualification phase. Family data from ground testing or previous flights is commonly used to detect initiating failure modes and their timing; however, this approach relies heavily on engineering judgment and is more error-prone for new launch vehicles. To address these limitations, we utilize Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for supervised classification of time-series anomalies. Although, initial training labels derived from simulated anomaly data may be suboptimal due to variations in anomaly strength, anomaly settling times, and other factors. In this work, we propose a novel statistical detector based on the Mahalanobis distance and forward-backward detection fractions to adjust the supervised training labels. We demonstrate our method on digital twin simulations of a ground-stage propulsion system with 20.8 minutes of operation per trial and O(10^8) training timesteps. The statistical data relabeling improved precision and recall of the LSTM classifier by 7% and 22% respectively.

Abstract: Intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG) is widely used for fetal monitoring during labor, yet its interpretation suffers from high inter-observer variability and limited predictive accuracy. Deep learning approaches have been constrained by the scarcity of CTG recordings with clinical outcome labels. We present the first application of self-supervised pre-training to intrapartum CTG analysis, leveraging 2,444 hours of unlabeled recordings for masked pre-training followed by fine-tuning on the 552-recording CTU-UHB benchmark. Using a PatchTST transformer architecture with a channel-asymmetric masking scheme designed for fetal heart rate reconstruction, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on the full test set and 0.853 on uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, exceeding previously reported results on this benchmark (0.68-0.75). Error analysis reveals that false-positive alerts typically correspond to CTG patterns judged concerning on retrospective clinical review, suggesting clinically meaningful predictions even when umbilical pH is normal. We release standardized dataset splits and model weights to enable reproducible benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training can address data scarcity in fetal monitoring, offering a path toward reliable decision support in the labor room.

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到未涉及的模型族，能在不确定时明确弃权，可实现生产部署中的可靠结构化提取。

Abstract: Structured extraction with LLMs fails in production not because models lack understanding, but because output formatting is unreliable across models and prompts. A prompt that returns clean JSON on GPT-4 may produce fenced, prose-wrapped, or malformed output on Llama, causing strict parsers to reject otherwise correct extractions. We formalize this as format collapse and introduce a dual-metric evaluation framework: ROS (strict parsing, measuring operational reliability) and CSS (post-canonicalization, measuring semantic capability). On a 37,346-example camera metadata benchmark across six model families, we find severe format collapse (for example, Gemma-2B: ROS 0.116 versus CSS 0.246) and large cross-model portability gaps (0.4 to 0.6 F1). We then present PromptPort, a reliability layer combining deterministic canonicalization with a lightweight verifier (DistilBERT) and a safe-override policy. PromptPort recovers format failures (plus 6 to 8 F1), adds verifier-driven semantic selection (plus 14 to 16 F1 beyond canonicalization), and approaches per-field oracle performance (0.890 versus 0.896 in zero-shot) without modifying base models. The method generalizes to held-out model families and provides explicit abstention when uncertain, enabling reliable structured extraction in production deployments.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale source datasets are reshaping the traditional training paradigm for time series classification. However, existing time series foundation models primarily focus on forecasting tasks and often overlook classification-specific challenges, such as modeling interpretable shapelets that capture class-discriminative temporal features. To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains. Experiments on 128 UCR datasets and 30 additional time series datasets demonstrate that UniShape achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, with interpretability and ablation analyses further validating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型对齐方法大多静态，训练后策略冻结，运行时控制有限，需要一种运行时可控的对齐方法。

Method: 引入ECLIPTICA将对齐视为指令驱动、运行时可控；提出CITA方法，结合SFT和对比偏好优化；发布ECLIPTICA基准测试。

Result: 在Llama - 3.1 - 8B上，CITA在五个套件中达到86.7%的指令对齐效率，超越DPO、GRPO和PPO。

Conclusion: ECLIPTICA和CITA方法在大语言模型对齐方面实现运行时可控对齐，提升了效率。

Abstract: Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is still largely static: after training, the policy is frozen. DPO, GRPO methods typically imprint one behavior into the weights, leaving little runtime control beyond prompt hacks or expensive re-alignment. We introduce ECLIPTICA, which treats alignment as instruction-driven and runtime-controllable: natural-language alignment instructions act as an explicit behavioral contract (stance, refusal boundary, verbosity) that modulates behavior on the fly under evolving safety requirements, user roles, and governance constraints.
  We introduce CITA (Contrastive Instruction-Tuned Alignment), combining SFT with contrastive preference optimization under an explicit geometric anchor to a reference model. This yields a stable Riemannian chart and keeps instruction updates within a shared neighborhood, so regimes stay nearby and traversable for reliable switching.
  To isolate policy switching from ordinary instruction following, we release the ECLIPTICA benchmark: 3000 controlled cases (300 prompts x 10 instruction types) where the user request is fixed and only the alignment instruction changes. On Llama-3.1-8B across five suites (ECLIPTICA, TruthfulQA, Conditional Safety, Length Control, LITMUS), CITA reaches 86.7% instruction-alignment efficiency, beating DPO (56.1%), GRPO (36.1%), and PPO (20.4%).

Result: 理论证明满足认证卸载定义，无删除数据的卸载模型难以与重新训练模型区分，建立效用边界。

Conclusion: 通过广泛实验验证框架在不同去中心化设置下的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Driven by the right to be forgotten (RTBF), machine unlearning has become an essential requirement for privacy-preserving machine learning. However, its realization in decentralized federated learning (DFL) remains largely unexplored. In DFL, clients exchange local updates only with neighbors, causing model information to propagate and mix across the network. As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data. We also establish utility bounds showing that the unlearned model remains close to retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments across diverse decentralized settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

Abstract: In the context of personalized medicine, machine learning algorithms are growing in popularity. These algorithms require substantial information, which can be acquired effectively through the usage of previously gathered data. Open data and the utilization of synthetization techniques have been proposed to address this. In this paper, we propose and evaluate alternative approach that uses additional simulated data based on summary statistics published in the literature. The simulated data are used to pretrain random forests, which are afterwards fine-tuned on a real dataset. We compare the predictive performance of the new approach to random forests trained only on the real data. A Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV) framework with 100 iterations was employed to investigate significance and stability of the results. Since a first study yielded inconclusive results, a second study with improved methodology (i.e., systematic information extraction and different prediction outcome) was conducted. In Study 1, some pretrained random forests descriptively outperformed the standard random forest. However, this improvement was not significant (t(99) = 0.89, p = 0.19). Contrary to expectations, in Study 2 the random forest trained only with the real data outperformed the pretrained random forests. We conclude with a discussion of challenges, such as the scarcity of informative publications, and recommendations for future research.

Motivation: 研究基于LSE目标的梯度下降与EM的联系，以及解决可能出现的坍塌问题。

Method: 在单层编码器中实例化理论，使用具有LSE目标和InfoMax正则化进行体积控制。

Result: 梯度 - 责任恒等式确切成立；仅LSE会坍塌；方差防止死分量；去相关防止冗余；模型呈现类似EM的优化动态。

Conclusion: 隐式EM理论能为架构设计提供指导，所得到的无解码器模型可学习可解释的混合分量。

Abstract: Gradient descent on log-sum-exp (LSE) objectives performs implicit expectation--maximization (EM): the gradient with respect to each component output equals its responsibility. The same theory predicts collapse without volume control analogous to the log-determinant in Gaussian mixture models. We instantiate the theory in a single-layer encoder with an LSE objective and InfoMax regularization for volume control. Experiments confirm the theory's predictions. The gradient--responsibility identity holds exactly; LSE alone collapses; variance prevents dead components; decorrelation prevents redundancy. The model exhibits EM-like optimization dynamics in which lower loss does not correspond to better features and adaptive optimizers offer no advantage. The resulting decoder-free model learns interpretable mixture components, confirming that implicit EM theory can prescribe architectures.

Method: 提出Scalable - Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre)框架，引入冲突感知稳定设计，用谱迹正则化和几何对齐稳定优化，用Informax Decoupler识别相关参数并自适应重新加权更新。

Result: 在对象、风格和明确内容上实验表明，ScaPre能有效移除目标概念，保持生成质量，在可接受质量范围内比最佳基线多遗忘5倍概念。

Conclusion: ScaPre达到大规模遗忘的最先进精度和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, yet their use raises copyright and misuse concerns, prompting research into machine unlearning. However, extending multi-concept unlearning to large-scale scenarios remains difficult due to three challenges: (i) conflicting weight updates that hinder unlearning or degrade generation; (ii) imprecise mechanisms that cause collateral damage to similar content; and (iii) reliance on additional data or modules, creating scalability bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Scalable-Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre), a unified framework tailored for large-scale unlearning. ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design, integrating spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, suppress conflicts, and preserve global structure. Furthermore, an Informax Decoupler identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates, strictly confining unlearning to the target subspace. ScaPre yields an efficient closed-form solution without requiring auxiliary data or sub-models. Comprehensive experiments on objects, styles, and explicit content demonstrate that ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality. It forgets up to $\times \mathbf{5}$ more concepts than the best baseline within acceptable quality limits, achieving state-of-the-art precision and efficiency for large-scale unlearning.

Conclusion: PGAR可作为现有优化和学习管道的插件层，在安全相关设置中支持可解释的可靠性追踪。

Abstract: Parent-Guided Adaptive Reliability (PGAR) is a lightweight behavioural meta-learning framework that adds a supervisory "parent" layer on top of a standard learner to improve stability, calibration, and recovery under disturbances. PGAR computes three reflex-level signals (incident detection, overconfidence correction, and recovery memory) and fuses them into a bounded reliability index in [0,1]. This index continuously modulates the learner's effective learning rate, reducing update magnitude during instability and restoring it as reliability improves. We provide a Lyapunov-based proof sketch establishing bounded adaptation of the reliability dynamics under mild assumptions (smooth loss, descent direction, and bounded reflex outputs). Empirical evaluations on representative learning tasks show improved calibration, reduced loss variance, and faster recovery compared to standard optimizers, while retaining computational simplicity. PGAR functions as a plug-in reliability layer for existing optimization and learning pipelines, supporting interpretable reliability traces in safety-relevant settings.

Abstract: A central problem in machine learning theory is to characterize how learning dynamics select particular solutions among the many compatible with the training objective, a phenomenon, called implicit bias, which remains only partially characterized. In the present work, we identify a general mechanism, in terms of an explicit geometric correction of the learning dynamics, for the emergence of implicit biases, arising from the interaction between continuous symmetries in the model's parametrization and stochasticity in the optimization process. Our viewpoint is constructive in two complementary directions: given model symmetries, one can derive the implicit bias they induce; conversely, one can inverse-design a wide class of different implicit biases by computing specific redundant parameterizations. More precisely, we show that, when the dynamics is expressed in the quotient space obtained by factoring out the symmetry group of the parameterization, the resulting stochastic differential equation gains a closed form geometric correction in the stationary distribution of the optimizer dynamics favoring orbits with small local volume. We compute the resulting symmetry induced bias for a range of architectures, showing how several well known results fit into a single unified framework. The approach also provides a practical methodology for deriving implicit biases in new settings, and it yields concrete, testable predictions that we confirm by numerical simulations on toy models trained on synthetic data, leaving more complex scenarios for future work. Finally, we test the implicit bias inverse-design procedure in notable cases, including biases toward sparsity in linear features or in spectral properties of the model parameters.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小范围扰动和小学术数据集，与实际企业应用相关性有限，企业LLM应用需在不同场景下保持高质量和可靠性能，对微小变化有鲁棒性。

Method: 提出综合基准测试套件，评估多种扰动类型下模型的鲁棒性，评估了11个不同参数规模的模型。

Result: 微小扰动使关键企业指标性能最多下降40个百分点，模型大小与鲁棒性关系复杂，8B参数的Ministral 3 8B模型表现优于多数大模型，Llama 3.1 8B模型整体表现最差。

Conclusion: 企业LLM应用对鲁棒性有较高要求，模型大小与鲁棒性并非简单正相关。

Abstract: Enterprise LLM applications require consistently high quality and reliable performance across diverse scenarios, demanding robustness to minor variations. Existing research shows that even small prompt changes can lead to substantial differences in output, but has mainly focused on a narrow set of perturbations with small academic datasets, limiting their relevance to real-world applications. To address this, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates robustness across multiple perturbation types, including general text edits (e.g., punctuation, whitespace), formatting changes (e.g., JSON, YAML), multilingual and cross-lingual inputs, and positional variations in instructions. Evaluating 11 models ranging from 4B to 120B+ parameters, we find that minor perturbations reduce performance by up to 40 percentage points on key enterprise metrics. Critically, we demonstrate that the relationship between model size and robustness is more nuanced than conventional assumptions suggest: an 8B parameter model (Ministral 3 8B) outperforms most larger models, while another 8B model (Llama 3.1 8B) performs worst overall.

Motivation: 现有基于偏好的对齐目标假设人类偏好表达强度相同，与实际中偏好强度因个体和情境而异的情况不匹配，限制了捕捉异质人类判断的能力。

Method: 引入Mixed Logit Direct Preference Optimization (MixDPO)，对Direct Preference Optimization进行泛化以建模偏好强度变化。

Result: 在三个偏好数据集上用两个开源权重语言模型评估，MixDPO提升聚合对齐性能（Pythia - 2.8B上提高11.2分），保留子组偏好，在偏好异质性高的设置中提升最大。

Conclusion: MixDPO通过学习强度分布使偏好异质性显式化，已发布代码便于复现。

Abstract: Preference based alignment objectives implicitly assume that all human preferences are expressed with equal strength. In practice, however, preference strength varies across individuals and contexts -- a phenomenon established in behavioral economics and discrete choice theory. This mismatch limits the ability of existing objectives to faithfully capture heterogeneous human judgments. Inspired by this literature, we introduce Mixed Logit Direct Preference Optimization (MixDPO), a generalization of Direct Preference Optimization that models variation in preference strength. MixDPO enables alignment objectives to capture heterogeneity in how strongly preferences are expressed across training examples. We evaluate MixDPO on three preference datasets using two open-weight language models. Across datasets, MixDPO improves aggregate alignment performance (+11.2 points on Pythia-2.8B) while preserving subgroup level preferences, with the largest gains appearing in settings with higher inferred preference heterogeneity. MixDPO makes preference heterogeneity explicit through learned strength distributions. We release our code for reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce a community challenge designed to facilitate direct comparisons between data-driven methods for compression, forecasting, and sensing of complex aerospace flows. The challenge is organized into three tracks that target these complementary capabilities: compression (compact representations for large datasets), forecasting (predicting future flow states from a finite history), and sensing (inferring unmeasured flow states from limited measurements). Across these tracks, multiple challenges span diverse flow datasets and use cases, each emphasizing different model requirements. The challenge is open to anyone, and we invite broad participation to build a comprehensive and balanced picture of what works and where current methods fall short. To support fair comparisons, we provide standardized success metrics, evaluation tools, and baseline implementations, with one classical and one machine-learning baseline per challenge. Final assessments use blind tests on withheld data. We explicitly encourage negative results and careful analyses of limitations. Outcomes will be disseminated through an AIAA Journal Virtual Collection and invited presentations at AIAA conferences.

Abstract: The Rashomon effect -- the existence of multiple, distinct models that achieve nearly equivalent predictive performance -- has emerged as a fundamental phenomenon in modern machine learning and statistics. In this paper, we explore the causes underlying the Rashomon effect, organizing them into three categories: statistical sources arising from finite samples and noise in the data-generating process; structural sources arising from non-convexity of optimization objectives and unobserved variables that create fundamental non-identifiability; and procedural sources arising from limitations of optimization algorithms and deliberate restrictions to suboptimal model classes. We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises. A key distinction emerges: statistical multiplicity diminishes with more data, structural multiplicity persists asymptotically and cannot be resolved without different data or additional assumptions, and procedural multiplicity reflects choices made by practitioners. Beyond characterizing causes, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by the Rashomon effect, including implications for inference, interpretability, fairness, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Conclusion: TG - DCMADDPG在动态和受限的MEC场景中具有强大的可扩展性和实际有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of IoT devices and latency-sensitive applications, the demand for both real-time and energy-efficient computing has surged, placing significant pressure on traditional cloud computing architectures. Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出低秩更新有效的“无毛”特性，MPS Adaptation PEFT方法有相似行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.

Conclusion: MLB为开发临床可行的大语言模型提供了严格框架。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative potential for healthcare, yet practical deployment is hindered by the absence of frameworks that assess real-world clinical utility. Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Medical LLM Benchmark MLB, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs on both foundational knowledge and scenario-based reasoning. MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol. MLB thus provides a rigorous framework to guide the development of clinically viable LLMs.

Abstract: Understanding the structure of complex, nonstationary, high-dimensional time-evolving signals is a central challenge in scientific data analysis. In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies.

Abstract: Battery capacity degradation prediction has long been a central topic in battery health analytics, and most studies focus on state of health (SoH) estimation and end of life (EoL) prediction. This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.

Abstract: We study the multinomial logit (MNL) contextual bandit problem for sequential assortment selection. Although most existing research assumes utility functions to be linear in item features, this linearity assumption restricts the modeling of intricate interactions between items and user preferences. A recent work (Zhang & Luo, 2024) has investigated general utility function classes, yet its method faces fundamental trade-offs between computational tractability and statistical efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. Our result establishes that sharp $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret is attainable even with neural network-based utilities, without relying on strong assumptions such as neural tangent kernel approximations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first computationally tractable algorithm for MNL contextual bandits with non-linear utilities that provably attains $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing robust performance not only in realizable settings but also in scenarios with model misspecification.

Method: 提出MB - ICL，利用冻结大语言模型提取的潜在表示，联合建模局部流形结构和类感知原型几何，基于示例与学习原型的接近度选择示例。

Result: 在事实验证和幻觉检测基准测试中，多数评估设置下MB - ICL优于标准ICL选择基线，在对话和摘要任务上增益明显，在温度扰动和模型变化下保持鲁棒。

Conclusion: 基于流形的原型选择为幻觉检测提供可靠且轻训练的方法，无需修改大语言模型参数，为改进ICL示例选择提供原则性方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate factually incorrect or unsupported content, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Prior work has explored decoding strategies, retrieval augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for hallucination detection, while recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) can substantially influence factual reliability. However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.
  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.
  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.

Conclusion: FROAV使大语言模型智能体研究更易被更广泛科研群体接受，让研究者专注假设检验和算法创新，而非系统集成问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into autonomous agent systems has created unprecedented opportunities for document analysis, decision support, and knowledge retrieval. However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges.

Motivation: 准确预测PPI中突变后果对药物设计和蛋白质工程至关重要，但深度学习预测受限于难以获取突变蛋白结构和未整合PPI动态变化。

Method: 提出Refine - PPI框架，包括用掩码突变建模任务训练结构细化模块生成突变结构，采用概率密度云网络（PDC - Net）捕捉3D动态变化和原子不确定性。

Result: 在SKEMPI.v2上的综合实验表明Refine - PPI在预测自由能变化方面优于所有现有工具。

Conclusion: 幻觉策略和PDC模块能有效解决突变蛋白结构缺失和几何不确定性建模问题。

Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) represents a central challenge within the biology field, and accurately predicting the consequences of mutations in this context is crucial for drug design and protein engineering. Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty.

Motivation: 风力发电机部件故障会影响系统功能，振动信号复杂导致故障检测困难，需要有效的信号处理技术提高诊断准确性。

Result: 在真实数据集上F1分数达到98.95%，在检测精度和计算速度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为风力发电系统的可靠高效故障诊断提供了平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Wind turbines play a critical role in the shift toward sustainable energy generation. Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales. These are then input into the MSCNN, which performs deep hierarchical feature extraction and classification. The proposed method achieves an F1 Score of 98.95\%, evaluated on real-world datasets, and demonstrates superior performance in both detection accuracy and computational speed compared to existing approaches. This framework offers a balanced solution for reliable and efficient fault diagnosis in wind turbine systems.

Result: ZeroRouter框架始终优于所有基线, 以更低成本和延迟实现更高准确性。

Conclusion: ZeroRouter打破了大语言模型的“模型锁定”，为新模型的零样本接入提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a fragmented and inefficient ecosystem, a state of ``model lock-in'' where seamlessly integrating novel models remains a significant bottleneck. Current routing frameworks require exhaustive, costly retraining, hindering scalability and adaptability. We introduce ZeroRouter, a new paradigm for LLM routing that breaks this lock-in. Our approach is founded on a universal latent space, a model-agnostic representation of query difficulty that fundamentally decouples the characterization of a query from the profiling of a model. This allows for zero-shot onboarding of new models without full-scale retraining. ZeroRouter features a context-aware predictor that maps queries to this universal space and a dual-mode optimizer that balances accuracy, cost, and latency. Our framework consistently outperforms all baselines, delivering higher accuracy at lower cost and latency.

Method: 引入迭代Hessian混合这一依赖高斯草图的DP - OLS新算法，并对新算法和先前基于高斯草图的方法进行效用分析。

Result: 新方法克服了先前方法的内在局限，比AdaSSP有显著改进，实验显示新方法持续优于先前基准方法。

Conclusion: 迭代Hessian混合算法在DP - OLS上有良好表现，为该领域提供了更优方案。

Abstract: We study differentially private ordinary least squares (DP-OLS) with bounded data. The dominant approach, adaptive sufficient-statistics perturbation (AdaSSP), adds an adaptively chosen perturbation to the sufficient statistics, namely, the matrix $X^{\top}X$ and the vector $X^{\top}Y$, and is known to achieve near-optimal accuracy and to have strong empirical performance. In contrast, methods that rely on Gaussian-sketching, which ensure differential privacy by pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, are widely used in federated and distributed regression, yet remain relatively uncommon for DP-OLS. In this work, we introduce the iterative Hessian mixing, a novel DP-OLS algorithm that relies on Gaussian sketches and is inspired by the iterative Hessian sketch algorithm. We provide utility analysis for the iterative Hessian mixing as well as a new analysis for the previous methods that rely on Gaussian sketches. Then, we show that our new approach circumvents the intrinsic limitations of the prior methods and provides non-trivial improvements over AdaSSP. We conclude by running an extensive set of experiments across standard benchmarks to demonstrate further that our approach consistently outperforms these prior baselines.

Result: 在七个真实世界多变量时间序列数据集上的实验表明，LDTC能取得高质量聚类结果。

Conclusion: LDTC是一种有效且高效处理时间聚类问题的有前景方法。

Abstract: Clustering temporal and dynamically changing multivariate time series from real-world fields, called temporal clustering for short, has been a major challenge due to inherent complexities. Although several deep temporal clustering algorithms have demonstrated a strong advantage over traditional methods in terms of model learning and clustering results, the accuracy of the few algorithms are not satisfactory. None of the existing algorithms can continuously learn new tasks and deal with the dynamic data effectively and efficiently in the sequential tasks learning. To bridge the gap and tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm \textbf{L}ifelong \textbf{D}eep \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}lustering (\textbf{LDTC}), which effectively integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into an end-to-end deep unsupervised learning framework. Using a specifically designed autoencoder and jointly optimizing for both the latent representation and clustering objective, the LDTC can achieve high-quality clustering results. Moreover, unlike any previous work, the LDTC is uniquely equipped with the fully dynamic model expansion and rehearsal-based techniques to effectively learn new tasks and to tackle the dynamic data in the sequential tasks learning without the catastrophic forgetting or degradation of the model accuracy. Experiments on seven real-world multivariate time series datasets show that the LDTC is a promising method for dealing with temporal clustering issues effectively and efficiently.

Motivation: 大语言模型有生成有毒内容风险，传统方法无法消除参数中的有毒区域，先前机制研究存在局限性，需找到识别和去除有毒子空间的方法。

Method: 提出GLOSS方法，从FFN参数中识别并消除全局有毒子空间。

Result: 在Qwen3等大语言模型上实验，GLOSS实现了SOTA排毒效果，且保留了模型的通用能力，无需大规模重新训练。

Conclusion: GLOSS是一种有效的减轻大语言模型毒性的轻量级方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but pose inherent risks of generating toxic content, restricting their safe deployment. While traditional methods (e.g., alignment) adjust output preferences, they fail to eliminate underlying toxic regions in parameters, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Prior mechanistic studies characterize toxic regions as "toxic vectors" or "layer-wise subspaces", yet our analysis identifies critical limitations: i) Removed toxic vectors can be reconstructed via linear combinations of non-toxic vectors, demanding targeting of entire toxic subspace; ii) Contrastive objective over limited samples inject noise into layer-wise subspaces, hindering stable extraction. These highlight the challenge of identifying robust toxic subspace and removing them. Therefore, we propose GLOSS (GLobal tOxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight method that mitigates toxicity by identifying and eliminating this global subspace from FFN parameters. Experiments on LLMs (e.g., Qwen3) show GLOSS achieves SOTA detoxification while preserving general capabilities without requiring large-scale retraining. WARNING: This paper contains context which is toxic in nature.

Abstract: Battery management systems increasingly require accurate battery health prognostics under strict on-device constraints. This paper presents DLNet, a practical framework with dual-stage distillation of liquid neural networks that turns a high-capacity model into compact and edge-deployable models for battery health prediction. DLNet first applies Euler discretization to reformulate liquid dynamics for embedded compatibility. It then performs dual-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the teacher model's temporal behavior and recover it after further compression. Pareto-guided selection under joint error-cost objectives retains student models that balance accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate DLNet on a widely used dataset and validate real-device feasibility on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense using int8 deployment. The final deployed student achieves a low error of 0.0066 when predicting battery health over the next 100 cycles, which is 15.4% lower than the teacher model. It reduces the model size from 616 kB to 94 kB with 84.7% reduction and takes 21 ms per inference on the device. These results support a practical smaller wins observation that a small model can match or exceed a large teacher for edge-based prognostics with proper supervision and selection. Beyond batteries, the DLNet framework can extend to other industrial analytics tasks with strict hardware constraints.

Abstract: An artificial neural network (ANN) is a numerical method used to solve complex classification problems. Due to its high classification power, the ANN method often outperforms other classification methods in terms of accuracy. However, an ANN model lacks interpretability compared to methods that use the symbolic paradigm. Our idea is to derive a symbolic representation from a simple ANN model trained on minterm values of input objects. Based on ReLU nodes, the ANN model is partitioned into cells. We convert the ANN model into a cell-based, three-dimensional bit tensor. The theory of Formal Concept Analysis applied to the tensor yields concepts that are represented as logic trees, expressing interpretable attribute interactions. Their evaluations preserve the classification power of the initial ANN model.

Conclusion: 对齐在几何上局部化，SPINAL可作为实用审计信号，量化对齐情况。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a principled, scalable alternative to RLHF for aligning large language models from pairwise preferences, but its internal geometric footprint remains undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training.

Abstract: Inferring high-dimensional physical states from sparse, ad-hoc sensor arrays is a fundamental challenge across AI for Science, as they are complicated by irregular geometries and the profound Sim-to-Real gap in physical modeling. Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing. Remarkably, interpretability analysis reveals that the model shows scientific-agent-like features: it autonomously discovers geometric information bottlenecks and learns an attention policy that prioritizes sparse sensor placements, effectively recovering principles of optimal experimental design from data alone.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在现实预测任务中有效，能提升语言模型预测性能。

Abstract: Many real-world prediction problems lack labels observable at prediction time, creating a temporal gap between prediction and outcome that yields supervision only after events resolve. To address this setting, we extend reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to temporally resolved real-world prediction, and use it to train language models to make probabilistic forecasts under causally masked information with retrospective evaluation using proper scoring rules. Supervision is derived solely from post-resolution outcomes, preserving delayed-reward semantics. On real-world forecasting benchmarks, Qwen3-32B trained using Foresight Learning improves Brier score by 27% and halves calibration error relative to its pretrained baseline, and outperforms Qwen3-235B on both constructed future-event prediction tasks and the Metaculus benchmark despite a 7x parameter disadvantage.

RHFL+, a state-of-the-art method, was proposed to address these challenges in settings with heterogeneous client models. This work investigates the robustness of RHFL+ under class imbalances through three key contributions: (1) reproduction of RHFL+ along with all benchmark algorithms under a unified evaluation framework; (2) extension of RHFL+ to real-world medical imaging datasets, including CBIS-DDSM, BreastMNIST and BHI; (3) a novel implementation using NVFlare, NVIDIA's production-level federated learning framework, enabling a modular, scalable and deployment-ready codebase. To validate effectiveness, extensive ablation studies, algorithmic comparisons under various noise conditions and scalability experiments across increasing numbers of clients are conducted.

Conclusion: ABA是一种可扩展的反聚类算法，在大规模实例和平衡K割分区中表现出色，代码可在GitHub获取。

Abstract: The anticlustering problem is to partition a set of objects into K equal-sized anticlusters such that the sum of distances within anticlusters is maximized. The anticlustering problem is NP-hard. We focus on anticlustering in Euclidean spaces, where the input data is tabular and each object is represented as a D-dimensional feature vector. Distances are measured as squared Euclidean distances between the respective vectors. Applications of Euclidean anticlustering include social studies, particularly in psychology, K-fold cross-validation in which each fold should be a good representative of the entire dataset, the creation of mini-batches for gradient descent in neural network training, and balanced K-cut partitioning. In particular, machine-learning applications involve million-scale datasets and very large values of K, making scalable anticlustering algorithms essential. Existing algorithms are either exact methods that can solve only small instances or heuristic methods, among which the most scalable is the exchange-based heuristic fast_anticlustering. We propose a new algorithm, the Assignment-Based Anticlustering algorithm (ABA), which scales to very large instances. A computational study shows that ABA outperforms fast_anticlustering in both solution quality and running time. Moreover, ABA scales to instances with millions of objects and hundreds of thousands of anticlusters within short running times, beyond what fast_anticlustering can handle. As a balanced K-cut partitioning method for tabular data, ABA is superior to the well-known METIS method in both solution quality and running time. The code of the ABA algorithm is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出Monkey Jump方法，将专家混合风格专业化引入参数高效微调，不引入额外可训练参数，实验表现好且应用广泛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专家混合式参数高效微调会增加内存使用和训练成本，违背核心目标。

Method: 将Transformer块中现有适配器视为隐式专家，用k - means聚类路由，无需梯度和学习参数。

Result: 在多任务实验中表现有竞争力，使用更少可训练参数、更低内存消耗、更快训练速度。

Conclusion: Monkey Jump与架构无关，可应用于任何基于适配器的参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts variants of parameter-efficient fine-tuning enable per-token specialization, but they introduce additional trainable routers and expert parameters, increasing memory usage and training cost. This undermines the core goal of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We propose Monkey Jump, a method that brings mixture-of-experts-style specialization to parameter-efficient fine-tuning without introducing extra trainable parameters for experts or routers. Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects. Across multi-task experiments covering 14 text, 14 image, and 19 video benchmarks, Monkey Jump achieves competitive performance with mixture-of-experts-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods while using 7 to 29 times fewer trainable parameters, up to 48 percent lower memory consumption, and 1.5 to 2 times faster training. Monkey Jump is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning method.

Motivation: 利用图神经网络和RNA - seq数据进行癌症分类，识别关键基因和生物过程，为癌症生物标志物发现提供方法。

Method: 结合TCGA基因表达数据和STRING蛋白质相互作用网络；采用Chebyshev图卷积和加权池化层聚合基因簇；用显著性方法解释模型。

Result: 增加卷积和池化层不能提升分类性能，单池化层F1 - macro分数最高达0.978，多层会导致过平滑和性能下降；模型可通过梯度方法解释。

Conclusion: 更深GNN架构不能提升性能，但分层池化结构为肿瘤生物学提供有价值见解，GNN是癌症生物标志物发现和解释的有前途工具。

Abstract: This study explores the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical pooling and multiple convolution layers for cancer classification based on RNA-seq data. We combine gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with a precomputed STRING protein-protein interaction network to classify tissue origin and distinguish between normal and tumor samples. The model employs Chebyshev graph convolutions (K=2) and weighted pooling layers, aggregating gene clusters into 'supernodes' across multiple coarsening levels. This approach enables dimensionality reduction while preserving meaningful interactions. Saliency methods were applied to interpret the model by identifying key genes and biological processes relevant to cancer. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of convolution and pooling layers did not enhance classification performance. The highest F1-macro score (0.978) was achieved with a single pooling layer. However, adding more layers resulted in over-smoothing and performance degradation. However, the model proved highly interpretable through gradient methods, identifying known cancer-related genes and highlighting enriched biological processes, and its hierarchical structure can be used to develop new explainable architectures. Overall, while deeper GNN architectures did not improve performance, the hierarchical pooling structure provided valuable insights into tumor biology, making GNNs a promising tool for cancer biomarker discovery and interpretation

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效探索客户端的复杂聚类分布，具有优越性。

Abstract: Driven by the growth of Web-scale decentralized services, Federated Clustering (FC) aims to extract knowledge from heterogeneous clients in an unsupervised manner while preserving the clients' privacy, which has emerged as a significant challenge due to the lack of label guidance and the Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of clients. In real scenarios such as personalized recommendation and cross-device user profiling, the global cluster may be fragmented and distributed among different clients, and the clusters may exist at different granularities or even nested. Although Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is considered promising for exploring such distributions, the sophisticated recursive clustering process makes it more computationally expensive and vulnerable to privacy exposure, thus relatively unexplored under the federated learning scenario. This paper introduces an efficient one-shot hierarchical FC framework that performs client-end distribution exploration and server-end distribution aggregation through one-way prototype-level communication from clients to the server. A fine partition mechanism is developed to generate successive clusterlets to describe the complex landscape of the clients' clusters. Then, a multi-granular learning mechanism on the server is proposed to fuse the clusterlets, even when they have inconsistent granularities generated from different clients. It turns out that the complex cluster distributions across clients can be efficiently explored, and extensive experiments comparing state-of-the-art methods on ten public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法大幅减少大生成步长的质量下降，让扩散语言模型兼具高生成速度和输出保真度。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) achieve significant speed by generating multiple tokens in parallel. However, this parallel sampling approach, especially when using fewer inference steps, will introduce strong dependency errors and cause quality to deteriorate rapidly as the generation step size grows. As a result, reliable self-correction becomes essential for maintaining high-quality multi-token generation. To address this, we propose Decoupled Self-Correction (DSC), a novel two-stage methodology. DSC first fully optimizes the DLM's generative ability before freezing the model and training a specialized correction head. This decoupling preserves the model's peak SFT performance and ensures the generated errors used for correction head training are of higher quality. Additionally, we introduce Future-Context Augmentation (FCA) to maximize the correction head's accuracy. FCA generalizes the error training distribution by augmenting samples with ground-truth tokens, effectively training the head to utilize a richer, future-looking context. This mechanism is used for reliably detecting the subtle errors of the high-fidelity base model. Our DSC framework enables the model, at inference time, to jointly generate and revise tokens, thereby correcting errors introduced by multi-token generation and mitigating error accumulation across steps. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces the quality degradation associated with larger generation steps, allowing DLMs to achieve both high generation speed and strong output fidelity.

Conclusion: 建立物理信息树搜索作为计算设计和高维科学优化的可扩展、可解释范式，连接离散决策和连续搜索。

Abstract: High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.

Method: 继承Mega和Megalodon设计，引入时间步衰减归一化、滑动块注意力机制和自适应工作内存等技术组件。

Result: 在70亿参数规模和2万亿训练标记的预训练对比中，Gecko训练损失达1.68，优于Llama2 - 7B和Megalodon - 7B；能稳定处理达400万个标记的序列，检索信息的上下文长度可达注意力窗口的4倍。

Conclusion: Gecko在处理长序列数据时具有更好的效率和长上下文可扩展性，无需上下文扩展技术即可实现长上下文处理和检索。

Abstract: Designing a unified neural network to efficiently and inherently process sequential data with arbitrary lengths is a central and challenging problem in sequence modeling. The design choices in Transformer, including quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation, have limited their ability to scale to long sequences. In this work, we propose Gecko, a neural architecture that inherits the design of Mega and Megalodon (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability to capture long range dependencies, including timestep decay normalization, sliding chunk attention mechanism, and adaptive working memory. In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67). Notably, without relying on any context-extension techniques, Gecko exhibits inherent long-context processing and retrieval capabilities, stably handling sequences of up to 4 million tokens and retrieving information from contexts up to $4\times$ longer than its attention window.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for differential equations with neural networks has shown great potential in scientific computing, but ensuring their stability under input perturbations remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a robust self-supervised neural operator framework that enhances stability through adversarial training while preserving accuracy. We formulate operator learning as a min-max optimization problem, where the model is trained against worst-case input perturbations to achieve consistent performance under both normal and adversarial conditions. We demonstrate that our method not only achieves good performance on standard inputs, but also maintains high fidelity under adversarial perturbed inputs. The results highlight the importance of stability-aware training in operator learning and provide a foundation for developing reliable neural PDE solvers in real-world applications, where input noise and uncertainties are inevitable.

Conclusion: ArenaRL能使大语言模型代理为复杂现实任务生成更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has substantially improved the performance of LLM agents on tasks with verifiable outcomes, but it still struggles on open-ended agent tasks with vast solution spaces (e.g., complex travel planning). Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ArenaRL substantially outperforms standard RL baselines, enabling LLM agents to generate more robust solutions for complex real-world tasks.

Conclusion: LookaHES是复杂决策空间中长程优化的有效工具，代码可在指定链接获取。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a common framework for optimizing black-box functions, yet most existing methods assume static query costs and rely on myopic acquisition strategies. We introduce LookaHES, a nonmyopic BO framework designed for dynamic, history-dependent cost environments, where evaluation costs vary with prior actions, such as travel distance in spatial tasks or edit distance in sequence design. LookaHES combines a multi-step variant of $H$-Entropy Search with pathwise sampling and neural policy optimization, enabling long-horizon planning beyond twenty steps without the exponential complexity of existing nonmyopic methods. The key innovation is the integration of neural policies, including large language models, to effectively navigate structured, combinatorial action spaces such as protein sequences. These policies amortize lookahead planning and can be integrated with domain-specific constraints during rollout. Empirically, LookaHES outperforms strong myopic and nonmyopic baselines across nine synthetic benchmarks from two to eight dimensions and two real-world tasks: geospatial optimization using NASA night-light imagery and protein sequence design with constrained token-level edits. In short, LookaHES provides a general, scalable, and cost-aware solution for robust long-horizon optimization in complex decision spaces, which makes it a useful tool for researchers in machine learning, statistics, and applied domains. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/sangttruong/nonmyopia.

Conclusion: 为工业下一代质量控制工作流程铺平道路。

Abstract: Contemporary industrial Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods require sensing capabilities that operate in occluded, hazardous, or access restricted environments. Yet, the current visual inspection based on optical cameras offers limited quality of service to that respect. In that sense, novel methods for workpiece inspection, suitable, for smart manufacturing are needed. Programmable Wireless Environments (PWE) could help towards that direction, by redefining the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) wave propagation as a controllable inspector entity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Non-Destructive Inspection, leveraging an RF sensing pipeline based on RF wavefront encoding for retrieving workpiece-image entries from a designated database. This approach combines PWE-enabled RF wave manipulation with machine learning (ML) tools trained to produce visual outputs for quality inspection. Specifically, we establish correlation relationships between RF wavefronts and target industrial assets, hence yielding a dataset which links wavefronts to their corresponding images in a structured manner. Subsequently, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) derives visual representations closely matching the database entries. Our results indicate that the proposed method achieves an SSIM 99.5% matching score in visual outputs, paving the way for next-generation quality control workflows in industry.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of the grid carbon intensity factor (CIF) is critical for enabling demand-side management and reducing emissions in modern electricity systems. Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules. Designed with built-in interpretability, the proposed model also enables better understanding of its predictive behavior, as shown in a case study where it adaptively shifts attention to relevant variables and time intervals during a disruptive event.

Result: 在 AEMO 和 ISO - NE 两个数据平台实验，模型表现优于对比模型。

Conclusion: MFRD 模型在 STELF 中有较好效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful method in various applications. However, their application to Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) -- a typical scenario in energy systems -- remains largely unexplored. Considering the nonlinear and fluctuating characteristics of the load data, effectively utilizing the powerful modeling capabilities of diffusion models to enhance STELF accuracy remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model with multi-frequency reconstruction for STELF, referred to as the Multi-Frequency-Reconstruction-based Diffusion (MFRD) model. The MFRD model achieves accurate load forecasting through four key steps: (1) The original data is combined with the decomposed multi-frequency modes to form a new data representation; (2) The diffusion model adds noise to the new data, effectively reducing and weakening the noise in the original data; (3) The reverse process adopts a denoising network that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer to enhance noise removal; and (4) The inference process generates the final predictions based on the trained denoising network. To validate the effectiveness of the MFRD model, we conducted experiments on two data platforms: Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE). The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms the compared models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, utilizing simultaneous denoising to enable global planning and iterative refinement. While these capabilities are particularly advantageous for long-context generation, deploying such models faces a prohibitive memory capacity barrier stemming from severe system inefficiencies. We identify that existing inference systems are ill-suited for this paradigm: unlike autoregressive models constrained by the cumulative KV-cache, dLLMs are bottlenecked by transient activations recomputed at every step. Furthermore, general-purpose memory reuse mechanisms lack the global visibility to adapt to dLLMs' dynamic memory peaks, which toggle between logits and FFNs. To address these mismatches, we propose Mosaic, a memory-efficient inference system that shifts from local, static management to a global, dynamic paradigm. Mosaic integrates a mask-only logits kernel to eliminate redundancy, a lazy chunking optimizer driven by an online heuristic search to adaptively mitigate dynamic peaks, and a global memory manager to resolve fragmentation via virtual addressing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mosaic achieves an average 2.71$\times$ reduction in the memory peak-to-average ratio and increases the maximum inference sequence length supportable on identical hardware by 15.89-32.98$\times$. This scalability is achieved without compromising accuracy and speed, and in fact reducing latency by 4.12%-23.26%.

Conclusion: HELVAE是一种高效有效的多模态VAE模型，避免了子采样问题。

Abstract: Multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely used for weakly supervised generative learning with multiple modalities. Predominant methods aggregate unimodal inference distributions using either a product of experts (PoE), a mixture of experts (MoE), or their combinations to approximate the joint posterior. In this work, we revisit multimodal inference through the lens of probabilistic opinion pooling, an optimization-based approach. We start from Hölder pooling with $α=0.5$, which corresponds to the unique symmetric member of the $α\text{-divergence}$ family, and derive a moment-matching approximation, termed Hellinger. We then leverage such an approximation to propose HELVAE, a multimodal VAE that avoids sub-sampling, yielding an efficient yet effective model that: (i) learns more expressive latent representations as additional modalities are observed; and (ii) empirically achieves better trade-offs between generative coherence and quality, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.

Conclusion: 低复杂度解能带来更好的抽象效果。

Abstract: Learning robust and generalisable abstractions from high-dimensional input data is a central challenge in machine learning and its applications to high-energy physics (HEP). Solutions of lower functional complexity are known to produce abstractions that generalise more effectively and are more robust to input perturbations. In complex hypothesis spaces, inductive biases make such solutions learnable by shaping the loss geometry during optimisation. In a HEP classification task, we show that a soft symmetry respecting inductive bias creates approximate degeneracies in the loss, which we identify as pseudo-Goldstone modes. We quantify functional complexity using metrics derived from first principles Hessian analysis and via compressibility. Our results demonstrate that solutions of lower complexity give rise to abstractions that are more generalisable, robust, and efficiently distillable.

Abstract: We demonstrate CEDAR, an application for automating data science (DS) tasks with an agentic setup. Solving DS problems with LLMs is an underexplored area that has immense market value. The challenges are manifold: task complexities, data sizes, computational limitations, and context restrictions. We show that these can be alleviated via effective context engineering. We first impose structure into the initial prompt with DS-specific input fields, that serve as instructions for the agentic system. The solution is then materialized as an enumerated sequence of interleaved plan and code blocks generated by separate LLM agents, providing a readable structure to the context at any step of the workflow. Function calls for generating these intermediate texts, and for corresponding Python code, ensure that data stays local, and only aggregate statistics and associated instructions are injected into LLM prompts. Fault tolerance and context management are introduced via iterative code generation and smart history rendering. The viability of our agentic data scientist is demonstrated using canonical Kaggle challenges.

Abstract: Open-ended tasks, such as coding problems that are common in computer science education, provide detailed insights into student knowledge. However, training large language models (LLMs) to simulate and predict possible student errors in their responses to these problems can be challenging: they often suffer from mode collapse and fail to fully capture the diversity in syntax, style, and solution approach in student responses. In this work, we present KASER (Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator), a novel approach that aligns errors with student knowledge. We propose a training method based on reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward that reflects three aspects of student code prediction: i) code similarity to the ground-truth, ii) error matching, and iii) code prediction diversity. On two real-world datasets, we perform two levels of evaluation and show that: At the per-student-problem pair level, our method outperforms baselines on code and error prediction; at the per-problem level, our method outperforms baselines on error coverage and simulated code diversity.

Result: PromptMIA在不同基准数据集上持续获得高优势，理论分析给出攻击优势下界；现有防御策略面临挑战，有局限性。

Conclusion: 需要专门针对联邦场景提示调优的防御策略。

Abstract: Membership inference attack (MIA) poses a significant privacy threat in federated learning (FL) as it allows adversaries to determine whether a client's private dataset contains a specific data sample. While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings.

Abstract: Research in machine learning has questioned whether increases in training token counts reliably produce proportional performance gains in large language models. Building on prior work introducing an energy-aware parameter efficiency metric, this study empirically examines the effects of increasing training token counts under fixed hardware and training conditions. The significance of this work lies in the explicit integration of power consumption and execution duration, as reflected by the power sampling frequency, into token-scale analysis. This addresses a gap in prior studies emphasizing performance outcomes while underrepresenting computational and energy costs. Using a repeated-measures experimental design on a constant GPU instance with an identical model architecture, optimizer settings, and epoch counts, a 1.1-billion-parameter TinyLlama model was trained at three token counts (500K, 1M, and 2M). While conventional performance metrics exhibited inconsistent or diminishing returns across token scales, the inclusion of power consumption and execution duration revealed a strictly monotonic decline in training efficiency as token count increased. Repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated a strong effect of token count on parameter efficiency, with all pairwise comparisons remaining significant following Bonferroni correction. These findings indicate that increases in training token counts may be energetically inefficient even when marginal performance improvements are observed, underscoring the importance of efficiency-aware evaluation in large language model training.

Abstract: Real-time traffic prediction is critical for managing transportation systems during hurricane evacuations. Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance. This research provides a generalized and interpretable model for real-time evacuation traffic forecasting, with significant implications for evacuation traffic management.

Method: 在单张A40 GPU（48GB）上训练不到24小时，使用带可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）和低秩自适应（LoRA）。

Result: 最佳结果在AIME 24上Pass@1达到40.0%（较基线绝对提升11.1%），Pass@16达到70.0%；指令调优模型表现好，高度数学对齐模型性能崩溃。

Conclusion: “微预算”机制的成功关键在于适配器容量和模型初始化的相互作用；低预算RL更新对接近任务特定最优解的模型可能有破坏作用。

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning typically rely on massive scale, yet the question remains: can strong reasoning capabilities be induced in small language models ($\leq1.5\text{B}$) under extreme constraints? We investigate this by training models on a single A40 GPU (48GB) for under 24 hours using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We find that the success of this ``micro-budget" regime depends critically on the interplay between adapter capacity and model initialization. While low-rank adapters ($r=8$) consistently fail to capture the complex optimization dynamics of reasoning, high-rank adapters ($r=256$) unlock significant plasticity in standard instruction-tuned models. Our best result achieved an impressive 40.0\% Pass@1 on AIME 24 (an 11.1\% absolute improvement over baseline) and pushed Pass@16 to 70.0\%, demonstrating robust exploration capabilities. However, this plasticity is not universal: while instruction-tuned models utilized the budget to elongate their chain-of-thought and maximize reward, heavily math-aligned models suffered performance collapse, suggesting that noisy, low-budget RL updates can act as destructive interference for models already residing near a task-specific optimum.

Abstract: Complex AI systems make better predictions but often lack transparency, limiting trustworthiness, interpretability, and safe deployment. Common post hoc AI explainers, such as LIME, SHAP, HSIC, and SAGE, are model agnostic but are too restricted in one significant regard: they tend to misrank correlated features and require costly perturbations, which do not scale to high dimensional data. We introduce ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a theoretically grounded, simple, and reliable metric for explaining the contribution of input features to model outputs, which remains stable and consistent under noise and sampling variations. We demonstrate that ExCIR captures dependencies arising from correlated features through a lightweight single pass formulation. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient. To this end, we further extend ExCIR with an information theoretic foundation that unifies the correlation ratio with Canonical Correlation Analysis under mutual information bounds, enabling multi output and class conditioned explainability at scale.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models show strong promise for new biomedical prediction tasks, but concerns about trustworthiness have hindered their clinical adoption. In particular, it is often unclear whether a model relies on true clinical cues or on spurious hierarchical correlations in the data. This paper introduces a simple yet broadly applicable trustworthiness test grounded in stochastic proof-by-contradiction. Instead of just showing high test performance, our approach trains and tests on spurious labels carefully permuted based on a potential outcomes framework. A truly trustworthy model should fail under such label permutation; comparable accuracy across real and permuted labels indicates overfitting, shortcut learning, or data leakage. Our approach quantifies this behavior through interpretable Fisher-style p-values, which are well understood by domain experts across medical and life sciences. We evaluate our approach on multiple new bacterial diagnostics to separate tasks and models learning genuine causal relationships from those driven by dataset artifacts or statistical coincidences. Our work establishes a foundation to build rigor and trust between ML and life-science research communities, moving ML models one step closer to clinical adoption.

Abstract: Early identification of student success is crucial for enabling timely interventions, reducing dropout rates, and promoting on time graduation. In educational settings, AI powered systems have become essential for predicting student performance due to their advanced analytical capabilities. However, effectively leveraging diverse student data to uncover latent and complex patterns remains a key challenge. While prior studies have explored this area, the potential of dynamic data features and multi category entities has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a framework that integrates heterogeneous graph deep learning models to enhance early and continuous student performance prediction, using traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison. Our approach employs a graph metapath structure and incorporates dynamic assessment features, which progressively influence the student success prediction task. Experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset demonstrate promising results, achieving a 68.6% validation F1 score with only 7% of the semester completed, and reaching up to 89.5% near the semester's end. Our approach outperforms top machine learning models by 4.7% in validation F1 score during the critical early 7% of the semester, underscoring the value of dynamic features and heterogeneous graph representations in student success prediction.

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Deep learning models for radiology interpretation increasingly rely on multi-institutional data, yet privacy regulations and distribution shift across hospitals limit central data pooling. Federated learning (FL) allows hospitals to collaboratively train models without sharing raw images, but current FL algorithms typically assume a static data distribution. In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework. EWC constrains updates along parameters deemed important for previous tasks, while a memory of latent prototypes preserves class structure without storing raw images. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) at each client adds calibrated Gaussian noise to clipped gradients, providing formal privacy guarantees for individual radiographs.

Abstract: Wide-spread adoption of unmanned vehicle technologies requires the ability to predict the motion of the combined vehicle operation from observations. While the general prediction of such motion for an arbitrary control mechanism is difficult, for a particular choice of control, the dynamics reduces to the Lie-Poisson equations [33,34]. Our goal is to learn the phase-space dynamics and predict the motion solely from observations, without any knowledge of the control Hamiltonian or the nature of interaction between vehicles. To achieve that goal, we propose the Control Optimal Lie-Poisson Neural Networks (CO-LPNets) for learning and predicting the dynamics of the system from data. Our methods learn the mapping of the phase space through the composition of Poisson maps, which are obtained as flows from Hamiltonians that could be integrated explicitly. CO-LPNets preserve the Poisson bracket and thus preserve Casimirs to machine precision. We discuss the completeness of the derived neural networks and their efficiency in approximating the dynamics. To illustrate the power of the method, we apply these techniques to systems of $N=3$ particles evolving on ${\rm SO}(3)$ group, which describe coupled rigid bodies rotating about their center of mass, and ${\rm SE}(3)$ group, applicable to the movement of unmanned air and water vehicles. Numerical results demonstrate that CO-LPNets learn the dynamics in phase space from data points and reproduce trajectories, with good accuracy, over hundreds of time steps. The method uses a limited number of points ($\sim200$/dimension) and parameters ($\sim 1000$ in our case), demonstrating potential for practical applications and edge deployment.

Abstract: The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the gold standard for quantifying mental workload; however, due to its complexity and non-portability, it can be constraining. ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation. These outcomes form a basis for light, interpretable machine learning models that are implemented through wearable biosensors in non-lab environments. Synthetic HRV inclusion enhances robustness, particularly in sparse data situations. Overall, this work is an initiation for building low-cost, explainable, and real-time cognitive monitoring systems for mental health, education, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on ageing and clinical populations.

Conclusion: OES方法可有效提升GNN在金融欺诈检测中的性能，减少训练时间，缓解过拟合和过平滑问题。

Abstract: Financial fraud is always a major problem in the field of finance, as it can cause significant consequences. As a result, many approaches have been designed to detect it, and lately Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as a competent candidate. However, when trained with a large amount of data, they are slow and computationally demanding. In addition, GNNs may need a deep architecture to detect complex fraud patterns, but doing so may make them suffer from problems such as over-fitting or over-smoothing. Over-fitting leads to reduced generalisation of the model on unseen data, while over-smoothing causes all nodes' features to converge to a fixed point due to excessive aggregation of information from neighbouring nodes. In this research, I propose an approach called One-Side Edge Sampling (OES) that can potentially reduce training duration as well as the effects of over-smoothing and over-fitting. The approach leverages predictive confidence in an edge classification task to sample edges from the input graph during a certain number of epochs. To explain why OES can alleviate over-smoothing, I perform a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. In addition, to validate the effect of OES, I conduct experiments using different GNNs on two datasets. The results show that OES can empirically outperform backbone models in both shallow and deep architectures while also reducing training time.

Motivation: 现有Wasserstein - Fisher - Rao (WFR) 求解器不稳定、计算昂贵且难扩展，需新方法。

Result: 在单细胞生物学中实现更准确稳健的轨迹推断，在效率、稳定性和重建精度上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: WFR - FM为从不平衡快照学习动力系统建立统一高效范式。

Abstract: The Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) metric extends dynamic optimal transport (OT) by coupling displacement with change of mass, providing a principled geometry for modeling unbalanced snapshot dynamics. Existing WFR solvers, however, are often unstable, computationally expensive, and difficult to scale. Here we introduce WFR Flow Matching (WFR-FM), a simulation-free training algorithm that unifies flow matching with dynamic unbalanced OT. Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency, stability, and reconstruction accuracy. Overall, WFR-FM establishes a unified and efficient paradigm for learning dynamical systems from unbalanced snapshots, where not only states but also mass evolve over time.

Motivation: 大规模MoE模型训练需高成本GPU，低成本硬件无法直接用于大模型训练

Method: 提出MoE - DisCo框架，分解MoE模型，用无监督聚类分割数据，独立并行训练后集成微调

Result: 该方法在多项指标上匹配或超全参数训练，在不同数据集上降低Qwen1.5 - MoE - 2.7B和Llama - MoE - 3.5B模型训练成本47.6% - 69.5%

Conclusion: MoE - DisCo框架是大规模MoE模型低成本有效训练方案

Abstract: Training large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically requires high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs (e.g., A100), and their high cost has become a major barrier to large-model training. In contrast, affordable hardware is low-cost but constrained by memory capacity and bandwidth, making it unsuitable for direct LLM training. To address this, we propose MoE-DisCo (Mixture-of-Experts with Disentangled Clustering and Coordination), a staged training framework. MoE-DisCo decomposes the MoE model into multiple dense submodels, each consisting of a shared backbone and a single expert, and partitions the training data into subsets using unsupervised clustering. Each submodel is trained independently and in parallel on its assigned data subset using low-cost devices, without any inter-device communication. Subsequently, all experts are integrated into a complete MoE model and fine-tuned globally for a short period on high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs. Experiments show that our method matches or even surpasses full-parameter training in performance across multiple downstream tasks, loss function, and perplexity (PPL), while reducing training cost by 47.6 percent to 69.5 percent on Qwen1.5-MoE-2.7B and Llama-MoE-3.5B across different datasets.

Conclusion: U - MASK方法有效解决了数据稀缺、非平稳个性化中的不可能三角问题，可在多种场景提升性能。

Abstract: Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.

Abstract: Most multimodal models treat every negative pair alike, ignoring the ambiguous negatives that differ from the positive by only a small detail. We propose Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL), a lightweight add-on that turns these borderline cases into a curriculum signal. A Boundary-aware Negative Sampler gradually raises difficulty, while a Contrastive Local Attention loss highlights where the mismatch occurs. The two modules are fully differentiable and work with any off-the-shelf dual encoder. Theory predicts a fast O(1/n) error rate; practice shows up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and new SOTA on four large-scale benchmarks, all without extra labels.

Conclusion: 所提方法结合扩散模型生成能力和MLLMs语义理解能力，为训练MLLMs提供了强大且可泛化的自动增强策略，无需人工标注和额外监督。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet their effectiveness on multimodal sentiment analysis remains constrained by the scarcity of high-quality training data, which limits accurate multimodal understanding and generalization. To alleviate this bottleneck, we leverage diffusion models to perform semantics-preserving augmentation on the video and audio modalities, expanding the multimodal training distribution. However, increasing data quantity alone is insufficient, as diffusion-generated samples exhibit substantial quality variation and noisy augmentations may degrade performance. We therefore propose DaQ-MSA (Denoising and Qualifying Diffusion Augmentations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis), which introduces a quality scoring module to evaluate the reliability of augmented samples and assign adaptive training weights. By down-weighting low-quality samples and emphasizing high-fidelity ones, DaQ-MSA enables more stable learning. By integrating the generative capability of diffusion models with the semantic understanding of MLLMs, our approach provides a robust and generalizable automated augmentation strategy for training MLLMs without any human annotation or additional supervision.

Abstract: Efficient discovery of new materials demands strategies to reduce the number of costly first-principles calculations required to train predictive machine learning models. We develop and validate an active learning framework that iteratively selects informative training structures for machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) from large, heterogeneous materials databases, specifically the Materials Project and OQMD. Our framework integrates compositional and property-based descriptors with a neural network ensemble model, enabling real-time uncertainty quantification via Query-by-Committee. We systematically compare four selection strategies: random sampling (baseline), uncertainty-based sampling, diversity-based sampling (k-means clustering with farthest-point refinement), and a hybrid approach balancing both objectives. Experiments across four representative material systems (elemental carbon, silicon, iron, and a titanium-oxide compound) with 5 random seeds per configuration demonstrate that diversity sampling consistently achieves competitive or superior performance, with particularly strong advantages on complex systems like titanium-oxide (10.9% improvement, p=0.008). Our results show that intelligent data selection strategies can achieve target accuracy with 5-13% fewer labeled samples compared to random baselines. The entire pipeline executes on Google Colab in under 4 hours per system using less than 8 GB of RAM, thereby democratizing MLIP development for researchers globally with limited computational resources. Our open-source code and detailed experimental configurations are available on GitHub. This multi-system evaluation establishes practical guidelines for data-efficient MLIP training and highlights promising future directions including integration with symmetry-aware neural network architectures.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, a process enabling pre-trained models to remove the influence of specific training samples, has attracted significant attention in recent years. Although extensive research has focused on developing efficient machine unlearning strategies, we argue that these methods mainly aim at removing samples rather than removing samples' influence on the model, thus overlooking the fundamental definition of machine unlearning. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of existing unlearning schemes when the training dataset includes many samples similar to those targeted for unlearning. Specifically, we evaluate: Do existing unlearning methods truly adhere to the original definition of machine unlearning and effectively eliminate all influence of target samples when similar samples are present in the training dataset? Our extensive experiments, conducted on four carefully constructed datasets with thorough analysis, reveal a notable gap between the expected and actual performance of most existing unlearning methods for image and language models, even for the retraining-from-scratch baseline. Additionally, we also explore potential solutions to enhance current unlearning approaches.

Abstract: Robust hydrological simulation is key for sustainable development, water management strategies, and climate change adaptation. In recent years, deep learning methods have been demonstrated to outperform mechanistic models at the task of hydrological discharge simulation. Adoption of these methods has been catalysed by the proliferation of large sample hydrology datasets, consisting of the observed discharge and meteorological drivers, along with geological and topographical catchment descriptors. Deep learning methods infer rainfall-runoff characteristics that have been shown to generalise across catchments, benefitting from the data diversity in large datasets. Despite this, application to catchments in Africa has been limited. The lack of adoption of deep learning methodologies is primarily due to sparsity or lack of the spatiotemporal observational data required to enable downstream model training. We therefore investigate the application of deep learning models, including LSTMs, for hydrological discharge simulation in the transboundary Limpopo River basin, emphasising application to data scarce regions. We conduct a number of computational experiments primarily focused on assessing the impact of varying the LSTM model input data on performance. Results confirm that data constraints remain the largest obstacle to deep learning applications across African river basins. We further outline the impact of human influence on data-driven modelling which is a commonly overlooked aspect of data-driven large-sample hydrology approaches and investigate solutions for model adaptation under smaller datasets. Additionally, we include recommendations for future efforts towards seasonal hydrological discharge prediction and direct comparison or inclusion of SWAT model outputs, as well as architectural improvements.

Method: 采用二阶敏感度分析将高敏感度异常值与大量权重分布严格分离，使用Hessian - Masked Decoupling策略隔离敏感参数并对其余部分进行向量量化，引入残差稀疏反馈机制纠正量化误差。

Conclusion: HAS - VQ是带宽受限环境中无损压缩的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource- constrained devices. However, standard integer quantization (e.g., INT4) fundamentally degrades per- formance by imposing a uniform grid on the heavy-tailed distribution of weight parameters, particularly in smaller-scale models (e.g., <2B parameters). We introduce HAS-VQ (Hessian-Adaptive Sparse Vec- tor Quantization), a compression framework that strictly decouples high-sensitivity outliers from the bulk weight distribution using second-order sensitivity analysis. HAS-VQ employs a Hessian-Masked Decoupling strategy to isolate sensitive parameters, followed by robust Vector Quantization (VQ) of the remaining dense body. Crucially, we introduce a residual sparse feedback mechanism that corrects quan- tization errors in the most sensitive dimensions, ensuring exact reconstruction of outliers. We evaluate HAS-VQ on SmolLM2-1.7B, demonstrating two distinct regimes of superiority: (1) Pareto Dominance over Integer Baselines: At 4.23 effective bits-per-parameter (BPP), we achieve a perplexity of 14.23, significantly outperforming the standard INT4 baseline (20.03 PPL at 4.71 BPP). (2) High-Fidelity Compression: Relative to the FP16 baseline, HAS-VQ achieves a 2.3x reduction in model size (7.03 BPP) while maintaining statistically indistinguishable perplexity (10.12 vs. 10.04), effectively offering a lossless compression alternative for bandwidth-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 所提方法能解决牛顿法在非独立同分布数据删除时可认证遗忘的低效无效问题。

Abstract: The Newton method has been widely adopted to achieve certified unlearning. A critical assumption in existing approaches is that the data requested for unlearning are selected i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed). However,the problem of certified unlearning under non-i.i.d. deletions remains largely unexplored. In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets. We then propose a better certified unlearning approach by performing a distribution-aware certified unlearning framework based on iterative Newton updates constrained by a trust region. Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning. To demonstrate its practical effectiveness under distribution shift, we also conduct extensive experiments across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a comprehensive assessment of our approach.

Abstract: We propose a novel analysis of the Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD) algorithm with constant step size, interpreting the iterates of the algorithm as a Markov chain. We show that DSGD converges to a stationary distribution, with its bias, to first order, decomposable into two components: one due to decentralization (growing with the graph's spectral gap and clients' heterogeneity) and one due to stochasticity. Remarkably, the variance of local parameters is, at the first-order, inversely proportional to the number of clients, regardless of the network topology and even when clients' iterates are not averaged at the end. As a consequence of our analysis, we obtain non-asymptotic convergence bounds for clients' local iterates, confirming that DSGD has linear speed-up in the number of clients, and that the network topology only impacts higher-order terms.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).
  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.
  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset. This work advances the field of molecular imaging by demonstrating the potential of AI-driven radiogenomics for precision oncology, supporting non-invasive, accurate, and interpretable prediction of clinically actionable molecular biomarkers in GBM.

Motivation: 现有基准测试只能衡量模型是否正确，无法衡量其可靠性，特别是对于代理AI系统，单条重新表述的提示可能引发连锁故障，且现有评估未涵盖这种不稳定性。

Method: 提出语义稳定性（SS），通过释义一致性（PC@k）衡量，即生成k个释义，对每个进行贪心解码并计算模式一致性。

Result: 密度的Qwen3 - 0.6B一致性仅23.8%，稀疏性为32%时，一致性跃升至55.9%；相图显示方差降低快于偏差积累的最佳点，以及稳定性落向错误答案的区域。

Conclusion: 语义稳定性SS可作为诊断方差驱动的不可靠性的指标，但不是提高正确性的方法。

Abstract: Benchmarks measure whether a model is correct. They do not measure whether a model is reliable. This distinction is largely academic for single-shot inference, but becomes critical for agentic AI systems, where a single rephrased prompt can trigger cascading failures in multi-step execution. Yet this form of instability is not captured by existing evaluations.
  Hallucinations live in variance: they arise when semantically equivalent prompts activate inconsistent internal pathways, producing divergent outputs. Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge. We formalize this through Semantic Stability (SS), measured via Paraphrase Consistency (PC@k): generate k paraphrases, greedy decode each, compute mode agreement. SS is a diagnostic for variance-driven unreliability, not a method for improving correctness.
  We show that a dense Qwen3-0.6B agrees with itself only 23.8% of the time; at 32% sparsity, agreement jumps to 55.9%. A phase diagram reveals the sweet spot where variance reduction outpaces bias accumulation, and regimes where stability collapses onto wrong answers.

Motivation: 语言模型在高风险场景的安全性面临挑战，先前研究表明预训练期间的干预可提升安全性，本文旨在探讨预训练中安全干预的引入时机。

Method: 固定底层数据，改变安全课程设置，即干预分别在0%、20%、60%的预训练令牌预算后引入。

Result: 早引入能产生更鲁棒的模型，不过拒率不增加，下游微调后优势明显，模型可控性提升，内部表征被重塑。

Conclusion: 建议在预训练早期纳入安全信号，使模型对下游微调、越狱攻击更具鲁棒性，推理过程更可靠。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models in high-stakes settings remains a pressing challenge, as aligned behaviors are often brittle and easily undone by adversarial pressure or downstream finetuning. Prior work has shown that interventions applied during pretraining, such as rephrasing harmful content, can substantially improve the safety of the resulting models. In this paper, we study the fundamental question: "When during pretraining should safety interventions be introduced?" We keep the underlying data fixed and vary only the choice of a safety curriculum: the timing of these interventions, i.e., after 0%, 20%, or 60% of the pretraining token budget. We find that introducing interventions earlier generally yields more robust models with no increase in overrefusal rates, with the clearest benefits appearing after downstream, benign finetuning. We also see clear benefits in the steerability of models towards safer generations. Finally, we observe that earlier interventions reshape internal representations: linear probes more cleanly separate safe vs harmful examples. Overall, these results argue for incorporating safety signals early in pretraining, producing models that are more robust to downstream finetuning and jailbreaking, and more reliable under both standard and safety-aware inference procedures.

Motivation: 强化学习中的对抗鲁棒性难以实现，因为扰动影响整个轨迹，不同强度攻击效果不同，且合适强度因状态而异。

Result: 自适应调整攻击强度，中间α值可在保留标称性能的同时提高跨半径鲁棒性，优于固定和随机半径基线。

Conclusion: α - 奖励保持攻击能有效应对强化学习中的对抗鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in RL is difficult because perturbations affect entire trajectories: strong attacks can break learning, while weak attacks yield little robustness, and the appropriate strength varies by state. We propose $α$-reward-preserving attacks, which adapt the strength of the adversary so that an $α$ fraction of the nominal-to-worst-case return gap remains achievable at each state. In deep RL, we use a gradient-based attack direction and learn a state-dependent magnitude $η\le η_{\mathcal B}$ selected via a critic $Q^π_α((s,a),η)$ trained off-policy over diverse radii. This adaptive tuning calibrates attack strength and, with intermediate $α$, improves robustness across radii while preserving nominal performance, outperforming fixed- and random-radius baselines.

Abstract: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) are inherited arrhythmia syndromes associated with sudden cardiac death. Deep learning shows promise for ECG interpretation, but multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification with clinically grounded interpretability remains underdeveloped. Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence. These findings support potential utility for automated ECG screening pending validation.

Conclusion: SyntheFluor - RL在识别可合成荧光团用于进一步开发方面有效。

Abstract: Developing new fluorophores for advanced imaging techniques requires exploring new chemical space. While generative AI approaches have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reaction constraints. Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties. Of the 19 molecules, 14 were synthesized and 13 were experimentally confirmed. The top three were characterized, with the lead compound featuring a benzothiadiazole chromophore and exhibiting strong fluorescence (PLQY = 0.62), a large Stokes shift (97 nm), and a long excited-state lifetime (11.5 ns). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SyntheFluor-RL in the identification of synthetically accessible fluorophores for further development.

Conclusion: Veto方法有效解决了现有知识蒸馏方法的局限性，具有更好的性能

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring knowledge from large language models to smaller student models; however, conventional supervised KD often suffers from a distribution mismatch between training and inference. While on-policy KD approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by learning directly from student-generated outputs, they frequently encounter training instabilities because the distributional gap between the novice student and the expert teacher is often too wide to bridge directly. These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes. To address these limitations, we propose Veto, an objective-level reformulation that constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space. Unlike prior methods that mix data samples, Veto creates an intermediate target distribution that promotes alignment between the teacher and the student. By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity. Extensive experiments across various reasoning and generation tasks demonstrate that Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing on-policy baselines.

Abstract: Offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) combines the strengths of learning from diverse datasets in offline RL with the adaptability to new tasks of meta-RL, promising safe and efficient knowledge acquisition by RL agents. However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties. FLORA integrates a return feedback mechanism to adaptively adjust feature components. Furthermore, to learn precise task representations, FLORA explicitly models the complex task distribution using a chain of invertible transformations. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that FLORA achieves rapid adaptation and meta-policy improvement compared to baselines across various environments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务中，策略优化存在奖励信号稀疏问题，现有方法如 GRPO 指导有限，PRMs 单独使用有过早崩溃风险。

Method: 通过语义线索分割推理序列，将 PRM 分数归一化为 token 级优势，并通过位置参数偏移使分布与结果优势对齐。

Result: 在 MATH500 上，相比 GRPO，仅使用八次回滚且无价值网络，PRPO 使 Qwen2.5 - Math - 1.5B 准确率从 61.2% 提升到 64.4%。

Conclusion: PRPO 在无评判优化中实现了高效的细粒度功劳分配。

Abstract: Policy optimization for large language models often suffers from sparse reward signals in multi-step reasoning tasks. Critic-free methods like GRPO assign a single normalized outcome reward to all tokens, providing limited guidance for intermediate reasoning . While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer dense feedback, they risk premature collapse when used alone, as early low-reward tokens can drive policies toward truncated outputs. We introduce Process Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), which combines outcome reliability with process-level guidance in a critic-free framework. PRPO segments reasoning sequences based on semantic clues, normalizes PRM scores into token-level advantages, and aligns their distribution with outcome advantages through location-parameter shift. On MATH500, PRPO improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B accuracy from 61.2% to 64.4% over GRPO using only eight rollouts and no value network, demonstrating efficient fine-grained credit assignment within critic-free optimization.

Each article may earn up to two badges, each linked to verified code in its corresponding public repository. We describe the motivation, related initiatives, a formal framework, the potential impact, possible limitations, and alternative views.

TL;DR: 提出知识感知压缩框架FASC及依赖违规分数ρ，实验表明FASC在知识密集型基准测试上比基于方差方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型激活压缩方法（如SVD）对梯度不敏感，不能有效保留事实知识。

Method: 引入FASC框架，通过直接建模激活 - 梯度耦合选择子空间，利用Fisher信息矩阵识别关键维度，提出依赖违规分数ρ来量化激活 - 梯度耦合。

Result: 在Mistral - 7B和Llama - 3 - 8B上实验，FASC在50%秩约简时比基于方差方法在知识密集型基准上多保留6 - 8%的准确率，使7B模型达到13B未压缩模型的事实召回率。

Conclusion: ρ是存储知识的基本信号，高ρ层仅在模型训练中内化事实关联时出现。

Abstract: Post-training activation compression is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware. However, standard methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are gradient-blind: they preserve high-variance dimensions regardless of their impact on factual knowledge preservation. We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, which often reside in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (\r{ho}) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model. Our analysis reveals that \r{ho} serves as a fundamental signal of stored knowledge, with high-\r{ho} layers emerging only when models internalize factual associations during training.

Conclusion: 前向和后向推理目标提供不同且互补学习信号，前向提升解题能力，后向提升验证校准。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities yet frequently generate plausible but incorrect solutions, a phenomenon commonly termed hallucination. This paper investigates the effect of training objective composition on reasoning reliability through Direct Preference Optimization. Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%. Notably, both training variants reduce acknowledgement rate compared to the baseline, suggesting that preference optimization increases model confidence in its outputs. These findings indicate that forward and backward reasoning objectives provide distinct and complementary learning signals: forward training improves problem-solving capability, while backward training improves verification calibration. The complete training and evaluation pipeline, implemented efficiently through Low-Rank Adaptation, is released to facilitate further research.

Motivation: 现有防御方法在大语言模型微调时存在不足，仅依赖启发式实例级评估，忽略数据分布全局几何且未明确抵制有害模式。

Method: 引入Safety Optimal Transport (SOT) 框架，将安全微调从实例级过滤挑战转变为基于最优传输的分布级对齐任务，采用双参考“推拉”权重学习机制。

Result: 在不同模型家族和领域的大量实验表明，SOT显著增强了模型安全性，同时保持了有竞争力的下游性能。

Conclusion: SOT在大语言模型微调中能实现比基线更好的安全 - 效用权衡。

Abstract: The inherent safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is prone to erosion during fine-tuning, even when using seemingly innocuous datasets. While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CalPro能在分布变化下保持良好的覆盖率，表现优于标准共形方法，可应用于多种结构化回归任务。

Abstract: Deep protein structure predictors such as AlphaFold provide confidence estimates (e.g., pLDDT) that are often miscalibrated and degrade under distribution shifts across experimental modalities, temporal changes, and intrinsically disordered regions. We introduce CalPro, a prior-aware evidential-conformal framework for shift-robust uncertainty quantification. CalPro combines (i) a geometric evidential head that outputs Normal-Inverse-Gamma predictive distributions via a graph-based architecture; (ii) a differentiable conformal layer that enables end-to-end training with finite-sample coverage guarantees; and (iii) domain priors (disorder, flexibility) encoded as soft constraints. We derive structure-aware coverage guarantees under distribution shift using PAC-Bayesian bounds over ambiguity sets, and show that CalPro maintains near-nominal coverage while producing tighter intervals than standard conformal methods in regions where priors are informative. Empirically, CalPro exhibits at most 5% coverage degradation across modalities (vs. 15-25% for baselines), reduces calibration error by 30-50%, and improves downstream ligand-docking success by 25%. Beyond proteins, CalPro applies to structured regression tasks in which priors encode local reliability, validated on non-biological benchmarks.

Conclusion: MAESTRO能有效扩展GRPO到开放域，优化奖励标量化问题。

Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an efficient paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy is primarily confined to domains with verifiable ground truths. Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation.

Abstract: Accurate energy time-series forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid stability and promoting the integration of renewable energy, yet it faces significant challenges from complex temporal dependencies and the heterogeneity of multi-source data. To address these issues, we propose DDT, a novel and robust deep learning framework for high-precision time-series forecasting. At its core, DDT introduces two key innovations. First, we design a dual-masking mechanism that synergistically combines a strict causal mask with a data-driven dynamic mask. This novel design ensures theoretical causal consistency while adaptively focusing on the most salient historical information, overcoming the rigidity of traditional masking techniques. Second, our architecture features a dual-expert system that decouples the modeling of temporal dynamics and cross-variable correlations into parallel, specialized pathways, which are then intelligently integrated through a dynamic gated fusion module. We conducted extensive experiments on 7 challenging energy benchmark datasets, including ETTh, Electricity, and Solar. The results demonstrate that DDT consistently outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines across all prediction horizons, establishing a new benchmark for the task.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In noisy physical reservoirs, the classical information-processing capacity $C_{\mathrm{ip}}$ quantifies how well a linear readout can realize tasks measurable from the input history, yet $C_{\mathrm{ip}}$ can be far smaller than the observed rank of the readout covariance. We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{rank}(Σ_{XX})\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $Σ_{XX}\in \mathbb{R}^{\rm d\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $Σ_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is essential for understanding catalytic mechanisms and guiding enzyme engineering.However, existing deep learning-based enzyme-substrate interaction (ESI) predictors often exhibit performance degradation on sequence-divergent, out-of-distribution (OOD) cases, limiting robustness under biologically relevant perturbations.We propose O$^2$DENet, a lightweight, plug-and-play module that enhances OOD generalization via biologically and chemically informed perturbation augmentation and invariant representation learning.O$^2$DENet introduces enzyme-substrate perturbations and enforces consistency between original and augmented enzyme-substrate-pair representations to encourage invariance to distributional shifts.When integrated with representative ESI models, O$^2$DENet consistently improves predictive performance for both $k_{cat}$ and $K_m$ across stringent sequence-identity-based OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results among the evaluated methods in terms of accuracy and robustness metrics.Overall, O$^2$DENet provides a general and effective strategy to enhance the stability and deployability of data-driven enzyme kinetics predictors for real-world enzyme engineering applications.

TL;DR: 提出KAFUSE方法解决现有多视图无监督特征选择方法问题，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图无监督特征选择方法忽略特征间复杂非线性依赖且未考虑样本局部邻域清晰度差异，限制特征选择效果。

Method: 采用带正交约束的核对齐减少特征冗余，对不同视图相似度图堆叠形成的张量各切片进行样本级融合学习跨视图一致相似度图，将两步集成到统一模型。

Result: 在真实多视图数据集上的大量实验表明KAFUSE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KAFUSE能有效解决现有方法的问题，在多视图无监督特征选择上表现更优。

Abstract: Although multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has demonstrated success in dimensionality reduction for unlabeled multi-view data, most existing methods reduce feature redundancy by focusing on linear correlations among features but often overlook complex nonlinear dependencies. This limits the effectiveness of feature selection. In addition, existing methods fuse similarity graphs from multiple views by employing sample-invariant weights to preserve local structure. However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion. These two steps are integrated into a unified model for feature selection, enabling mutual enhancement between them. Extensive experiments on real multi-view datasets demonstrate the superiority of KAFUSE over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MUCE及相关改进和指标为局部可解释性提供实用方案，增强预测模型可解释性，支持更可信透明决策。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models has led to their characterization as black boxes due to the difficulty of explaining their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出BEAT - Net框架，将心电图诊断问题转化为语言建模任务，在准确率、鲁棒性、数据效率和可解释性方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习心电图诊断监督方法将记录视为无差别的1D信号或2D图像，导致数据效率低和不透明，与医学推理不符。

Method: 提出BEAT - Net框架，采用QRS标记化策略将连续信号转换为心跳序列，通过专门的编码器分解心脏生理学特征。

Result: 在三个大规模基准测试中，BEAT - Net达到主流CNN架构的诊断准确率，提升了鲁棒性，数据效率高，仅需30 - 35%标注数据，学习的注意力机制提供了可解释性。

Conclusion: 整合生物先验知识是数据密集型大规模预训练的高效且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, prevalent supervised methods typically treat recordings as undifferentiated one-dimensional (1D) signals or two-dimensional (2D) images. This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.

TL;DR: 当前基于可验证奖励的强化学习训练大语言模型推理任务时，近端策略优化（PPO）存在优势估计不可靠问题，本文提出分段优势估计（SAE）解决该问题并取得较好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO 应用于稀疏奖励的基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）方案时，优势估计不可靠，即广义优势估计（GAE）会在每一个标记上聚合时引入显著偏差。

Method: 提出分段优势估计（SAE），用低概率标记作为启发式边界将生成序列划分为连贯子段，仅从这些信息丰富的段转换中选择性计算方差降低的优势估计。

Result: 实验表明 SAE 在最终得分、训练稳定性和样本效率方面有显著改善，且在多个模型规模上效果一致，与近似真实优势的相关性更高。

Conclusion: SAE 能有效缓解 RLVR 中 GAE 可能产生的偏差，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is increasingly driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), where Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) provides a principled framework for stable policy updates. However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了用于参数偏微分方程（PDEs）的组合神经算子（CompNO）框架，通过学习基础块库并组装成特定任务求解器，在多个PDEs问题上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏微分方程的数值解计算成本高，现有科学基础模型（SFMs）存在可解释性有限和预训练成本高的问题。

Method: 引入CompNO框架，先学习基础块库，再通过轻量级适配块组装成特定任务求解器，并使用专用边界条件算子。

Result: 在PDEBench套件的多个方程上，CompNO比强基线模型有更低的相对L2误差，能精确满足边界条件，且在不同参数范围内泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 组合神经算子为PDEs的基础模型提供了可扩展且具有物理解释性的途径。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical phenomena, but their numerical solution remains computationally demanding, especially when repeated simulations are required across many parameter settings. Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.

We introduce a method that represents each patient as a matrix built from aggregated embeddings of all their notes, enabling robust patient similarity computation based on their latent low-rank representations. Using clinical notes of 4,267 Czech breast-cancer patients and expert similarity labels from Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, we evaluate several matrix-based similarity measures and analyze their strengths and limitations across different similarity facets, such as clinical history, treatment, and adverse events. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the presented method for downstream tasks, such as personalized therapy recommendations or toxicity warnings.

Motivation: 现代推理模型普遍交替使用SFT和RL训练，但缺乏理论证明它们是否可解耦，因此开展研究。

Method: 从理论上证明两种训练顺序（SFT - then - RL和RL - then - SFT）下无法解耦，并通过Qwen3 - 0.6B进行实验验证。

Result: 理论证明了两种顺序下的耦合情况，Qwen3 - 0.6B实验证明确实有性能下降。

Conclusion: SFT和RL在训练中不能解耦，否则会损失先前的性能。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗、法律等系统应用受限，传统方法无法捕捉细粒度、分布式能力编码，需更好理解其能力编码。

Method: 提出SCALPEL框架，将能力表示为低秩参数子空间，训练LoRA适配器降低区分正误答案能力，同时保留通用语言建模质量。

Result: 在不同任务实验中，SCALPEL成功移除目标能力，保留通用能力，揭示能力呈低秩结构，可通过参数空间干预选择性消融。

Conclusion: SCALPEL为理解大语言模型能力编码提供细粒度见解，有助于深入了解能力在参数空间的分布。

Abstract: Large language models excel across diverse domains, yet their deployment in healthcare, legal systems, and autonomous decision-making remains limited by incomplete understanding of their internal mechanisms. As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.

Conclusion: PLANET v2.0效率和准确性俱佳，有望成为虚拟筛选工作流程的实用工具之一，且可免费获取。

Abstract: Drug discovery represents a time-consuming and financially intensive process, and virtual screening can accelerate it. Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) can be studied with spectral fitting to provide physical constraints on accretion in extreme gravitational environments. Traditional methods of spectral fitting such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) face limitations due to computational times. We introduce a probabilistic model, utilizing a variational autoencoder with a normalizing flow, trained to adopt a physical latent space. This neural network produces predictions for spectral-model parameters as well as their full probability distributions. Our implementations result in a significant improvement in spectral reconstructions over a previous deterministic model while performing three orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.

Abstract: Global optimization of large-scale, complex systems such as multi-physics black-box simulations and real-world industrial systems is important but challenging. This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems.

Abstract: As models grow more capable, human supervision breaks down: labels don't scale, outputs can be gamed, and training doesn't generalize. Scalable oversight requires steering methods that are internal, self-supervised, and transfer out-of-distribution; existing methods satisfy some but not all three. We introduce AntiPaSTO, which separates representations along an anti-parallel axis ($α=\pm1$ produce opposite shifts), with coherence constraints preventing collapse. Human input is minimal: two contrasting words inserted into template sentences, no preference labels. Using 800 such pairs on Gemma-3-1B, AntiPaSTO beats prompting baselines by $6.9\times$ on DailyDilemmas and maintains bidirectional control where prompting triggers refusal.

Result: 实验证明框架有效，即使部分任务标注也能进行鲁棒多任务学习。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力实现鲁棒多任务学习。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is critical in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, enabling simultaneous handling of diverse tasks. However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated.

Abstract: The emergence of fine-grained numerical formats like NVFP4 presents new opportunities for efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16. Our code is available at https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant .

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动ICD编码存在标签空间大、类别极度不平衡问题，影响精确预测。

Method: 引入LabGraph框架，将ICD编码转化为图生成任务，结合对抗域适应、基于图的强化学习和扰动正则化，并使用标签图鉴别器提供自适应奖励反馈。

Result: 在基准数据集实验中，LabGraph在micro - F1、micro - AUC和P@K指标上始终优于先前方法。

Conclusion: LabGraph能有效增强模型鲁棒性和泛化性，是解决ICD编码问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Automated ICD coding involves assigning standardized diagnostic codes to clinical narratives. The vast label space and extreme class imbalance continue to challenge precise prediction. To address these issues, LabGraph is introduced -- a unified framework that reformulates ICD coding as a graph generation task. By combining adversarial domain adaptation, graph-based reinforcement learning, and perturbation regularization, LabGraph effectively enhances model robustness and generalization. In addition, a label graph discriminator dynamically evaluates each generated code, providing adaptive reward feedback during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LabGraph consistently outperforms previous approaches on micro-F1, micro-AUC, and P@K.

TL;DR: 提出基于LTT范式的FM生成解码器用于低延迟无线图像解码，在多数据集和信道上实验表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典分层设计和JSCC在低延迟下进行无线图像传输困难，扩散式生成解码器解码延迟高，需要低延迟解码方法。

Method: 提出LTT范式下的FM生成解码器，构建高斯平滑路径并推导教师速度场，训练神经网络学生向量场，通过线性MMSE均衡和奇异值域处理将瑞利衰落和MIMO信道映射为等效AWGN信道。

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion - MNIST和DIV2K数据集及AWGN、Rayleigh和MIMO信道实验中，优于JPEG2000+LDPC、DeepJSCC和扩散式基线方法，少量ODE步骤就能获得良好感知质量。

Conclusion: LTT为跨不同信道的生成式无线图像解码提供了确定性、物理解释性和计算高效的框架。

Abstract: Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.

Motivation: 将奇异学习理论应用到深度强化学习领域，探索其中的贝叶斯相变规律。

Method: 理论证明广义后验在策略上的集中由局部学习系数（LLC）控制；在网格世界环境中进行实验验证。

Result: 理论上预测强化学习中的贝叶斯相变从高后悔度简单策略到低后悔度复杂策略；实验上SGD训练的相变表现为后悔度急剧下降而LLC增加，且LLC能检测到相变。

Conclusion: LLC能捕捉底层算法的变化而非仅性能变化。

Abstract: Singular learning theory characterizes Bayesian learning as an evolving tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, with transitions between qualitatively different solutions as sample size increases. We extend this theory to deep reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of the generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as "opposing staircases" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance.

Motivation: 医学时间序列数据解读因高标注成本致数据稀缺，传统对比学习难捕捉复杂时间模式，需提升诊断准确性和泛化性。

Method: 提出CoDAC框架，利用外部健康数据，引入基于Transformer自编码器的CDE量化异常信号，通过DMCF自适应加权不同时间视图，编码器结合扩张卷积和多头注意力。

Result: 在多个数据集实验中，CoDAC各指标表现优越，优于现有基线，消融实验验证CDE和DMCF关键作用。

Conclusion: CoDAC为医学时间序列诊断提供稳健且可解释方案，有效缓解数据稀缺挑战。

Abstract: Medical time series data, such as EEG and ECG, are vital for diagnosing neurological and cardiovascular diseases. However, their precise interpretation faces significant challenges due to high annotation costs, leading to data scarcity, and the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in capturing complex temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability. Ablation studies further validate the critical contributions of CDE and DMCF. CoDAC offers a robust and interpretable solution for medical time series diagnosis, effectively mitigating data scarcity challenges.

Conclusion: 所提TFEC学习框架在多变量时间序列聚类任务中有优越性。

Abstract: Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering is crucial for signal processing and data analysis. Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型方法难以兼顾效率和性能，存在准确性 - 并行性权衡问题。

Method: 提出d3LLM，训练时引入伪轨迹蒸馏，推理时采用基于熵的多块解码和KV缓存刷新机制，还引入新指标AUP。

Result: d3LLM比vanilla LLaDA/Dream快10倍，比自回归模型快5倍，且精度无大幅下降。

Conclusion: d3LLM能有效平衡扩散大语言模型的准确性和并行性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop.

Conclusion: 漂移感知学习有新前景，潜在应用超血栓发现，可用于医疗 AI 稀缺数据场景。

Abstract: In an ideal medical environment, real-time coagulation monitoring can enable early detection and prompt remediation of risks. However, traditional Thromboelastography (TEG), a widely employed diagnostic modality, can only provide such outputs after nearly 1 hour of measurement. The delay might lead to elevated mortality rates. These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis. We develop MDFE to facilitate integration of varied temporal signals using multi-domain learning, and jointly learn high-level temporal interactions together with attentions via HLA; furthermore, the parameterized DAM we designed maintains the stability of the computed vital signs. PSR evaluates with 4 TEG-specialized data sets and establishes remarkable perfor-mance -- predictions of R2 > 0.98 for coagulation traits and error reduction around half compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and halving the inferencing time too. Drift-aware learning suggests a new future, with potential uses well be-yond thrombophilia discovery towards medical AI applica-tions with data scarcity.

Result: FLAD能无缝集成到各种持续学习范式中，在不同实验设置中始终优于标准和锐度感知优化器。

Conclusion: FLAD在持续学习中有效且实用。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to sequentially learn multiple tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. Recent studies have shown that optimizing towards flatter loss minima can improve model generalization. However, existing sharpness-aware methods for CL suffer from two key limitations: (1) they treat sharpness regularization as a unified signal without distinguishing the contributions of its components. and (2) they introduce substantial computational overhead that impedes practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FLAD, a novel optimization framework that decomposes sharpness-aware perturbations into gradient-aligned and stochastic-noise components, and show that retaining only the noise component promotes generalization. We further introduce a lightweight scheduling scheme that enables FLAD to maintain significant performance gains even under constrained training time. FLAD can be seamlessly integrated into various CL paradigms and consistently outperforms standard and sharpness-aware optimizers in diverse experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in CL.

Conclusion: 新方法能提高学习表示的域不变性，实现更好的分布外泛化，同时保持强分布内任务性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training with contrastive learning is a powerful method for learning from sparsely labeled data. However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure.

Result: 在多尺度函数逼近等实验中，Free - RBF - KAN精度与原KAN相当，且训练和推理更快。

Conclusion: Free - RBF - KAN在计算效率和自适应分辨率之间取得平衡，适用于高维结构化建模任务。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown strong potential for efficiently approximating complex nonlinear functions. However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks.

Result: 评估发现模型在表达信心时不考虑成本，在高惩罚条件下无战略响应，即使高惩罚时也很少弃权，导致效用崩溃。

Conclusion: 校准的口头信心分数可能不足以创建可信和可解释的AI系统，当前模型缺乏将不确定性信号转化为最优和风险敏感决策的战略能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.

Abstract: We introduce DT-ICU, a multimodal digital twin framework for continuous risk estimation in intensive care. DT-ICU integrates variable-length clinical time series with static patient information in a unified multitask architecture, enabling predictions to be updated as new observations accumulate over the ICU stay. We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care. The source code and trained model weights for DT-ICU are publicly available at https://github.com/GUO-W/DT-ICU-release.

Conclusion: 无论使用最优改进还是首次改进策略，随机抽样都比系统探索更高效。

Abstract: Local search is a fundamental method in operations research and combinatorial optimisation. It has been widely applied to a variety of challenging problems, including multi-objective optimisation where multiple, often conflicting, objectives need to be simultaneously considered. In multi-objective local search algorithms, a common practice is to maintain an archive of all non-dominated solutions found so far, from which the algorithm iteratively samples a solution to explore its neighbourhood. A central issue in this process is how to explore the neighbourhood of a selected solution. In general, there are two main approaches: 1) systematic exploration and 2) random sampling. The former systematically explores the solution's neighbours until a stopping condition is met -- for example, when the neighbourhood is exhausted (i.e., the best improvement strategy) or once a better solution is found (i.e., first improvement). In contrast, the latter randomly selects and evaluates only one neighbour of the solution. One may think systematic exploration may be more efficient, as it prevents from revisiting the same neighbours multiple times. In this paper, however, we show that this may not be the case. We first empirically demonstrate that the random sampling method is consistently faster than the systematic exploration method across a range of multi-objective problems. We then give an intuitive explanation for this phenomenon using toy examples, showing that the superior performance of the random sampling method relies on the distribution of ``good neighbours''. Next, we show that the number of such neighbours follows a certain probability distribution during the search. Lastly, building on this distribution, we provide a theoretical insight for why random sampling is more efficient than systematic exploration, regardless of whether the best improvement or first improvement strategy is used.

Conclusion: 所提算法能高效解决F4M优化问题，具有较好的性能。

Abstract: Few-for-many (F4M) optimization, recently introduced as a novel paradigm in multi-objective optimization, aims to find a small set of solutions that effectively handle a large number of conflicting objectives. Unlike traditional many-objective optimization methods, which typically attempt comprehensive coverage of the Pareto front, F4M optimization emphasizes finding a small representative solution set to efficiently address high-dimensional objective spaces. Motivated by the computational complexity and practical relevance of F4M optimization, this paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm explicitly tailored for efficiently solving F4M optimization problems. Inspired by SMS-EMOA, our proposed approach employs a $(μ+1)$-evolution strategy guided by the objective of F4M optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate rigorous performance assessment, we propose a novel benchmark test suite specifically designed for F4M optimization by leveraging the similarity between the R2 indicator and F4M formulations. Our test suite is highly flexible, allowing any existing multi-objective optimization problem to be transformed into a corresponding F4M instance via scalarization using the weighted Tchebycheff function. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, especially on instances involving a large number of objectives. The source code of the proposed algorithm will be released publicly. Source code is available at https://github.com/MOL-SZU/SoM-EMOA.

Conclusion: 用局部可塑性训练的紧凑反馈路径可在最小、机制透明的环境中支持再生和连续学习相关动态。

Abstract: Feedback-rich neural architectures can regenerate earlier representations and inject temporal context, making them a natural setting for strictly local synaptic plasticity. We ask whether a minimal, backpropagation-free feedback--Hebbian system can already express interpretable continual-learning--relevant behaviors under controlled training schedules. We introduce a compact prediction--reconstruction architecture with two feedforward layers for supervised association learning and two dedicated feedback layers trained to reconstruct earlier activity and re-inject it as additive temporal context. All synapses are updated by a unified local rule combining centered Hebbian covariance, Oja-style stabilization, and a local supervised drive where targets are available, requiring no weight transport or global error backpropagation. On a small two-pair association task, we characterize learning through layer-wise activity snapshots, connectivity trajectories (row/column means of learned weights), and a normalized retention index across phases. Under sequential A->B training, forward output connectivity exhibits a long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of the earlier association while feedback connectivity preserves an A-related trace during acquisition of B. Under deterministic interleaving A,B,A,B,..., both associations are concurrently maintained rather than sequentially suppressed. Architectural controls and rule-term ablations isolate the role of dedicated feedback in regeneration and co-maintenance, and the role of the local supervised term in output selectivity and unlearning. Together, the results show that a compact feedback pathway trained with local plasticity can support regeneration and continual-learning--relevant dynamics in a minimal, mechanistically transparent setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出ANTR方法解决基于代理模型校准的计算成本高及现有方法的局限性问题，实验表明其在校准精度和计算效率上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 校准基于代理的模型（ABMs）存在计算成本高问题，现有替代辅助进化算法（SAEAs）有难以替代原评估函数和无法在多任务间共享优化经验的局限性。

Method: 提出ANTR方法，用可预训练的神经密度估计器替代传统替代模型，结合多样性搜索策略和自适应信任区域方法。

Result: 在两个基于ABM的金融市场模拟器实验中，ANTR在校准精度和计算效率上显著优于传统元启发式算法和最先进的SAEAs，尤其在多市场条件的批量校准场景中。

Conclusion: ANTR能有效解决ABMs校准的计算成本问题和现有SAEAs的局限性。

Abstract: Calibrating Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is an important optimization problem for simulating the complex social systems, where the goal is to identify the optimal parameter of a given ABM by minimizing the discrepancy between the simulated data and the real-world observations. Unfortunately, it suffers from the extensive computational costs of iterative evaluations, which involves the expensive simulation with the candidate parameter. While Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely adopted to alleviate the computational burden, existing methods face two key limitations: 1) surrogating the original evaluation function is hard due the nonlinear yet multi-modal nature of the ABMs, and 2) the commonly used surrogates cannot share the optimization experience among multiple calibration tasks, making the batched calibration less effective. To address these issues, this work proposes Automatic posterior transformation with Negatively Correlated Search and Adaptive Trust-Region (ANTR). ANTR first replaces the traditional surrogates with a pretrainable neural density estimator that directly models the posterior distribution of the parameters given observed data, thereby aligning the optimization objective with parameter-space accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate a diversity-preserving search strategy to prevent premature convergence and an adaptive trust-region method to efficiently allocate computational resources. We take two representative ABM-based financial market simulators as the test bench as due to the high non-linearity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed ANTR significantly outperforms conventional metaheuristics and state-of-the-art SAEAs in both calibration accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in batch calibration scenarios across multiple market conditions.

Motivation: 探索神经形态计算在FPGA数字信号处理设计中的应用。

Method: 分析神经形态计算基础，用Verilog HDL在Vivado中有无神经形态计算实现滤波器。

Result: 神经形态计算可提供低延迟和突触可塑性，能降低功耗、提高效率，但降低数值精度。

Conclusion: 神经形态计算在数字信号处理有低延迟、节能优点，但存在数值精度问题。

Abstract: In this paper, the foundations of neuromorphic computing, spiking neural networks (SNNs) and memristors, are analyzed and discussed. Neuromorphic computing is then applied to FPGA design for digital signal processing (DSP). Finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are implemented with and without neuromorphic computing in Vivado using Verilog HDL. The results suggest that neuromorphic computing can provide low-latency and synaptic plasticity thereby enabling continuous on-chip learning. Due to their parallel and event-driven nature, neuromorphic computing can reduce power consumption by eliminating von Neumann bottlenecks and improve efficiency, but at the cost of reduced numeric precision.

Motivation: 传统ACO方法在复杂环境中存在盲目搜索和收敛慢的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出PFACO算法，采用三种策略：基于节点欧氏距离集中初始信息素分布；在迭代中强化优质解以加速收敛并保持多样性；引入前瞻性机制惩罚多余路径转弯。

Result: 实验表明PFACO在收敛速度和解决方案质量上一直优于对比的ACO算法。

Conclusion: PFACO算法的三种策略提高了全局优化能力，显著提升不同优化问题的收敛速度和解决方案质量。

Abstract: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a prominent swarm intelligence algorithm extensively applied to path planning. However, traditional ACO methods often exhibit shortcomings, such as blind search behavior and slow convergence within complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Pheromone-Focused Ant Colony Optimization (PFACO) algorithm, which introduces three key strategies to enhance the problem-solving ability of the ant colony. First, the initial pheromone distribution is concentrated in more promising regions based on the Euclidean distances of nodes to the start and end points, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Second, promising solutions are reinforced during colony iterations to intensify pheromone deposition along high-quality paths, accelerating convergence while maintaining solution diversity. Third, a forward-looking mechanism is implemented to penalize redundant path turns, promoting smoother and more efficient solutions. These strategies collectively produce the focused pheromones to guide the ant colony's search, which enhances the global optimization capabilities of the PFACO algorithm, significantly improving convergence speed and solution quality across diverse optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that PFACO consistently outperforms comparative ACO algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.

Result: 对成本 - 性能权衡进行建模并通过实验和模拟验证结果。

Conclusion: 讨论了设计边缘系统和开发高效资源与工作负载管理算法的实际意义。

Abstract: Edge computing provides a cloud-like architecture where small-scale resources are distributed near the network edge, enabling applications on resource-constrained devices to offload latency-critical computations to these resources. While some recent work showed that the resource constraints of the edge could result in higher end-to-end latency under medium to high utilization due to higher queuing delays, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work on modeling the trade-offs of deploying on edge versus cloud infrastructures in the presence of mobility. Understanding the costs and trade-offs of this architecture is important for network designers, as the architecture is now adopted to be part of 5G and beyond networks in the form of the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). In this paper we focus on quantifying and estimating the cost of edge computing. Using closed-form queuing models, we explore the cost-performance trade-offs in the presence of different systems dynamics. We model how workload mobility and workload variations influence these trade- offs, and validate our results with realistic experiments and simulations. Finally, we discuss the practical implications for designing edge systems and developing algorithms for efficient resource and workload management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件测试中将需求转化为可执行测试脚本是手动且易出错的，大语言模型生成代码时会出现幻觉问题。

Method: 提出 Autonomous QA Agent，这是一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的系统，将不同格式文件导入向量数据库，生成前检索相关上下文。

Result: 在 20 个电商测试场景中，RAG 方法语法有效性达 100%，执行成功率达 90%，优于标准大语言模型的 30%。

Conclusion: 虽然评估局限于单一领域，但该方法通过结合实际 DOM 结构显著减少幻觉，展示了 RAG 用于自动 UI 测试的潜力。

Abstract: Software testing is critical in the software development lifecycle, yet translating requirements into executable test scripts remains manual and error-prone. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, they often hallucinate non-existent UI elements. We present the Autonomous QA Agent, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that grounds Selenium script generation in project-specific documentation and HTML structure. By ingesting diverse formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML) into a vector database, our system retrieves relevant context before generation. Evaluation on 20 e-commerce test scenarios shows our RAG approach achieves 100% (20/20) syntax validity and 90% (18/20, 95% CI: [85%, 95%], p < 0.001) execution success, compared to 30% for standard LLM generation. While our evaluation is limited to a single domain, our method significantly reduces hallucinations by grounding generation in actual DOM structure, demonstrating RAG's potential for automated UI testing.

TL;DR: 介绍了名为Contract2Plan的经过验证的GenAI到优化器的管道，用于采购和库存规划，强调验证在基于合同的规划系统中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的提取在采购和库存规划中仅提取或仅使用LLM的决策管道很脆弱，容易产生不可行的计划或违反合同的情况，因此需要改进。

Method: 引入Contract2Plan管道，插入基于求解器的合规门，检索条款证据，提取约束模式，编译约束为BOM感知的MILP，并使用求解器诊断进行验证。

Result: 通过自包含的合成微基准测试显示，仅提取规划存在重尾遗憾和MOQ违规情况。

Conclusion: 验证应作为基于合同的规划系统的重要组成部分。

Abstract: Procurement and inventory planning is governed not only by demand forecasts and bills of materials (BOMs), but also by operational terms in contracts and supplier documents (e.g., MOQs, lead times, price tiers, allocation caps, substitution approvals). LLM-based extraction can speed up structuring these terms, but extraction-only or LLM-only decision pipelines are brittle: missed clauses, unit errors, and unresolved conflicts can yield infeasible plans or silent contract violations, amplified by BOM coupling. We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation. A self-contained synthetic micro-benchmark (500 instances; T=5) computed by exact enumeration under an execution model with MOQ uplift and emergency purchases shows heavy-tailed regret and nontrivial MOQ-violation incidence for extraction-only planning, motivating verification as a first-class component of contract-grounded planning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性方法召回率达到平台期，因其将特征视为线性独立，忽略上下文依赖和指标间关系。

Method: 应用多头自注意力机制作为后确定性评分细化机制，学习特征间上下文权重，动态调整文件重要性。

Result: 200个测试用例显示，自注意力机制使Top - 50召回率从约62 - 65%提升到78 - 82%，专家验证主观准确性从6.5/10提升到8.6/10。

Conclusion: 该方法缩小了确定性自动化和专家判断的推理能力差距，提高了仓库感知工作量估计的召回率。

Abstract: The identification and ranking of impacted files within software reposi-tories is a key challenge in change impact analysis. Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment. This transformation bridges the reasoning capability gap between deterministic automation and expert judgment, improving recall in repository-aware effort estimation.

Motivation: 企业面临网络安全漏洞增加，传统优先级框架如CVSS存在不足，无法考虑利用概率、合规紧迫性和运营影响，导致修复效率低下和延迟。

Method: 引入RiskBridge框架，采用概率性零日暴露模拟（ZDES）模型预测近期利用可能性，策略即代码引擎将监管要求转化为自动化SLA逻辑，基于ROI的优化器最大化每次修复工作的累积风险降低。

Result: 使用实时CVE数据集的实验评估显示，与现有商业基线相比，剩余风险降低88%，SLA合规性提高18天，修复效率提高35%。

Conclusion: RiskBridge是实用且可审计的决策智能系统，统一了概率建模、合规推理和优化分析，代表了现代企业环境中自动化、可解释和以业务为中心的漏洞管理方向。

Abstract: Enterprises are confronted with an unprece- dented escalation in cybersecurity vulnerabil- ities, with thousands of new CVEs disclosed each month. Conventional prioritization frame- works such as CVSS offer static severity met- rics that fail to account for exploit probabil- ity, compliance urgency, and operational im- pact, resulting in inefficient and delayed re- mediation. This paper introduces RiskBridge, an explainable and compliance-aware vulner- ability management framework that integrates multi-source intelligence from CVSS v4, EPSS, and CISA KEV to produce dynamic, business- aligned patch priorities. RiskBridge employs a probabilistic Zero-Day Exposure Simulation (ZDES) model to fore- cast near-term exploit likelihood, a Policy-as- Code Engine to translate regulatory mandates (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST SP 800-53) into auto- mated SLA logic, and an ROI-driven Opti- mizer to maximize cumulative risk reduction per remediation effort. Experimental evalua- tions using live CVE datasets demonstrate an 88% reduction in residual risk, an 18-day improvement in SLA compliance, and a 35% increase in remediation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art commercial baselines. These findings validate RiskBridge as a prac- tical and auditable decision-intelligence sys- tem that unifies probabilistic modeling, com- pliance reasoning, and optimization analytics. The framework represents a step toward auto- mated, explainable, and business-centric vul- nerability management in modern enterprise environments

Motivation: 目前对于SATD在当代基于大语言模型（LLM）系统中的表现和演变知之甚少，因此开展实证研究。

Method: 复制并扩展先前关于ML技术债务的工作到现代基于LLM的系统，对比477个仓库（每类159个）中SATD的普遍性，对SATD的引入和消除进行生存分析，对377个SATD实例进行定性分析，将SATD映射到LLM开发流程阶段。

Result: LLM仓库积累SATD的速度与ML系统相似（3.95% vs. 4.10%），但LLM仓库无债务时长是ML仓库的2.4倍（中位数492天 vs. 204天），之后快速积累债务；发现三种LLM开发特有的技术债务形式：模型栈变通方案债务、模型依赖债务和性能优化债务；债务集中在LLM开发流程特定阶段。

Conclusion: 对LLM时代的SATD有了更深入认识，发现新的技术债务形式及积累特点。

Abstract: Self-admitted technical debt (SATD), referring to comments flagged by developers that explicitly acknowledge suboptimal code or incomplete functionality, has received extensive attention in machine learning (ML) and traditional (Non-ML) software. However, little is known about how SATD manifests and evolves in contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, whose architectures, workflows, and dependencies differ fundamentally from both traditional and pre-LLM ML software. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of SATD in the LLM era, replicating and extending prior work on ML technical debt to modern LLM-based systems. We compare SATD prevalence across LLM, ML, and non-ML repositories across a total of 477 repositories (159 per category). We perform survival analysis of SATD introduction and removal to understand the dynamics of technical debt across different development paradigms. Surprisingly, despite their architectural complexity, our results reveal that LLM repositories accumulate SATD at similar rates to ML systems (3.95% vs. 4.10%). However, we observe that LLM repositories remain debt-free 2.4x longer than ML repositories (a median of 492 days vs. 204 days), and then start to accumulate technical debt rapidly. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of 377 SATD instances reveals three new forms of technical debt unique to LLM-based development that have not been reported in prior research: Model-Stack Workaround Debt, Model Dependency Debt, and Performance Optimization Debt. Finally, by mapping SATD to stages of the LLM development pipeline, we observe that debt concentrates

Abstract: EDA development and innovation has been constrained by scarcity of expert engineering resources. While leading LLMs have demonstrated excellent performance in coding and scientific reasoning tasks, their capacity to advance EDA technology itself has been largely untested.

Our contributions include (i) a closed-loop LLM framework for EDA code changes; (ii) a task suite and evaluation protocol on OpenROAD for PPA-oriented improvements; and (iii) end-to-end demonstrations with minimal human oversight. Experiments in OpenROAD achieve routed wirelength reductions of up to 5.9%, and effective clock period reductions of up to 10.0%.

Abstract: Quantum computing has become an active research field in recent years, as its applications in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and materials science are promising. Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization. This indicates a maturing field where developers are increasingly using high-level building blocks to solve real-world problems.

Result: 在自主无人机系统上展示SAFER，显著提高需求不一致检测，提升安全工程流程效率和可靠性。

Conclusion: 生成式AI需辅以形式化模型并系统查询，以提供有意义的早期安全需求规范和稳健安全架构。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for Foundational Analysis of Safety Engineering Requirements (SAFER), a model-driven methodology supported by Generative AI to improve the generation and analysis of safety requirements for complex safety-critical systems. Safety requirements are often specified by multiple stakeholders with uncoordinated objectives, leading to gaps, duplications, and contradictions that jeopardize system safety and compliance. Existing approaches are largely informal and insufficient for addressing these challenges. SAFER enhances Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) by consuming requirement specification models and generating the following results: (1) mapping requirements to system functions, (2) identifying functions with insufficient requirement specifications, (3) detecting duplicate requirements, and (4) identifying contradictions within requirement sets. SAFER provides structured analysis, reporting, and decision support for safety engineers. We demonstrate SAFER on an autonomous drone system, significantly improving the detection of requirement inconsistencies, enhancing both efficiency and reliability of the safety engineering process. We show that Generative AI must be augmented by formal models and queried systematically, to provide meaningful early-stage safety requirement specifications and robust safety architectures.

Motivation: 自动智能代理AI系统发展超出现有架构思维，传统运维原则不适用于该类系统，需新架构思维应对运行时可靠性挑战。

Result: CHANGE框架为架构AgentOps平台管理智能代理AI系统生命周期提供基础，并通过客户支持系统场景说明。

Conclusion: CHANGE框架重新定义了适应不确定性和持续进化的软件架构。

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic AI systems has outpaced the architectural thinking required to operate them effectively. These agents differ fundamentally from traditional software: their behavior is not fixed at deployment but continuously shaped by experience, feedback, and context. Applying operational principles inherited from DevOps or MLOps, built for deterministic software and traditional ML systems, assumes that system behavior can be managed through versioning, monitoring, and rollback. This assumption breaks down for Agentic AI systems whose learning trajectories diverge over time. This introduces non-determinism making system reliability a challenge at runtime. We argue that architecting such systems requires a shift from managing control loops to enabling dynamic co-evolution among agents, infrastructure, and human oversight. To guide this shift, we introduce CHANGE, a conceptual framework comprising six capabilities for operationalizing Agentic AI systems: Contextualize, Harmonize, Anticipate, Negotiate, Generate, and Evolve. CHANGE provides a foundation for architecting an AgentOps platform to manage the lifecycle of evolving Agentic AI systems, illustrated through a customer-support system scenario. In doing so, CHANGE redefines software architecture for an era where adaptation to uncertainty and continuous evolution are inherent properties of the system.

Motivation: 代码适应中解决CtxBugs是关键挑战，LLMs解决CtxBugs的能力是其实践应用的重大障碍，需评估其处理此类错误的能力。

Method: 提出CtxBugGen框架，通过四步生成CtxBugs，基于其构建的基准对四个先进LLMs进行实证研究。

Result: LLMs在解决CtxBugs上表现不佳，最佳表现的Kimi - K2的Pass@1为55.93%，仅解决52.47%的CtxBugs，CtxBugs使LLMs适应性能最多下降30%。

Conclusion: 研究凸显LLMs跨上下文推理的关键弱点，强调需新方法增强其上下文感知以实现可靠代码适应。

Abstract: Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs. Our study highlights a critical weakness in LLMs' cross-context reasoning and emphasize the need for new methods to enhance their context awareness for reliable code adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Fixturize框架解决大语言模型生成单元测试时忽视测试夹具构建的问题，还引入FixtureEval基准进行评估，结果显示该框架效果显著，表明测试夹具感知是现代自动测试流程的关键缺失部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在自动生成单元测试时，常忽略构建必要的测试夹具，需要解决此局限。

Method: 提出Fixturize诊断框架，通过迭代、反馈驱动过程识别依赖函数并合成测试夹具；引入FixtureEval基准进行评估，包含600个不同编程语言的函数，有明确的依赖标签。

Result: Fixturize识别测试夹具依赖的准确率达88.38%-97.00%，平均提升套件通过率18.03%-42.86%；与现有测试工具集成时，分别平均提升行/分支覆盖率16.85%/24.08%和31.54%/119.66%。

Conclusion: 测试夹具感知是现代自动测试流程中必不可少但缺失的部分。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced automated unit test generation but face a critical limitation: they often neglect to construct the necessary test fixtures, which are the environmental setups required for a test to run. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Fixturize, a diagnostic framework that proactively identifies fixture-dependent functions and synthesizes test fixtures accordingly through an iterative, feedback-driven process, thereby improving the quality of auto-generated test suites of existing approaches. For rigorous evaluation, the authors introduce FixtureEval, a dedicated benchmark comprising 600 curated functions across two Programming Languages (PLs), i.e., Python and Java, with explicit fixture dependency labels, enabling both the corresponding classification and generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that Fixturize is highly effective, achieving 88.38%-97.00% accuracy across benchmarks in identifying the dependence of test fixtures and significantly enhancing the Suite Pass rate (SuitePS) by 18.03%-42.86% on average across both PLs with the auto-generated fixtures. Owing to the maintenance of test fixtures, Fixturize further improves line/branch coverage when integrated with existing testing tools of both LLM-based and Search-based by 16.85%/24.08% and 31.54%/119.66% on average, respectively. The findings establish fixture awareness as an essential, missing component in modern auto-testing pipelines.

Conclusion: 本研究不追求普遍化，而是提供区域创新生态中敏捷研发项目技术质量管控的探索性基线。

Abstract: Managing technical quality in agile Research and Development (R&D) software projects represents a persistent challenge, particularly in contexts characterized by high technical uncertainty and experimental pressure. This exploratory pilot survey explores how agile R&D software teams report the use of practices and metrics related to technical quality control within Scrum-based environments. The study employed a structured questionnaire administered to professionals from Science and Technology Institutions (STIs) located in Manaus, Brazil, aiming to capture reported practices, perceptions of quality, and recurrent challenges. Quantitative data were complemented by qualitative responses to support contextual interpretation. The results indicate that although practices such as automated testing, code review, and continuous integration are widely acknowledged, their reported application is often inconsistent across iterations. Gaps were also observed in the monitoring of technical quality metrics and in the reporting of mechanisms for assessing technical debt from a business perspective. Rather than aiming for generalization, this study offers an exploratory baseline that describes how technical quality is managed in agile R&D projects within a regional innovation ecosystem.

Motivation: 机器学习软件用于高风险决策，确保软件在不同敏感群体表现一致需评估分离性，但评估分离性需测试数据点的真实标签，因而研究能否在比较判断测试数据上进行评估。

Method: 定义比较判断测试数据上的比较分离概念及评估指标，理论和实证证明二元分类中比较分离与分离等价，分析评估两者达相同统计功效所需的数据点和数据对数量。

Result: 在二元分类问题中，比较分离与分离等价，且分析出了评估所需数据点和数据对数量。

Conclusion: 首次探索了比较判断测试数据上的公平性评估，证明了使用该数据进行模型评估的可行性和实际益处。

Abstract: This research seeks to benefit the software engineering society by proposing comparative separation, a novel group fairness notion to evaluate the fairness of machine learning software on comparative judgment test data. Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data. It shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of using comparative judgment test data for model evaluations.

Motivation: 自主软件工程代理存在“封闭世界”局限，且现实世界问题跟踪数据非结构化、碎片化，阻碍获取开放世界的人类历史经验。

Method: 采用经验治理，将人类经验转化为代理友好的经验卡，并引入代理经验搜索策略实现逻辑驱动的人类专业知识检索。

Result: 生成13.5万张经验卡，使SWE - bench Verified上的解决率提高4.65%。

Conclusion: MemGovern作为插件式方法，为代理友好的内存基础设施提供了解决方案。

Abstract: While autonomous software engineering (SWE) agents are reshaping programming paradigms, they currently suffer from a "closed-world" limitation: they attempt to fix bugs from scratch or solely using local context, ignoring the immense historical human experience available on platforms like GitHub. Accessing this open-world experience is hindered by the unstructured and fragmented nature of real-world issue-tracking data. In this paper, we introduce MemGovern, a framework designed to govern and transform raw GitHub data into actionable experiential memory for agents. MemGovern employs experience governance to convert human experience into agent-friendly experience cards and introduces an agentic experience search strategy that enables logic-driven retrieval of human expertise. By producing 135K governed experience cards, MemGovern achieves a significant performance boost, improving resolution rates on the SWE-bench Verified by 4.65%. As a plug-in approach, MemGovern provides a solution for agent-friendly memory infrastructure.

TL;DR: 介绍PenForge框架，可动态构建专家代理进行渗透测试，在零日漏洞场景下有3倍于现有技术的成功率，还指出未来工作方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的渗透测试方法存在不足，单通用代理在复杂场景表现差，而专业代理无法适应多种漏洞类型。

Method: PenForge在测试时动态构建专家代理，将潜在攻击面的自动侦察与动态实例化的代理相结合进行上下文感知的漏洞利用。

Result: PenForge在零日漏洞场景的CVE - Bench上达到30.0%（12/40）的漏洞利用成功率，是现有技术的3倍。

Conclusion: PenForge体现了动态构建代理的早期范式转变思想，是迈向可扩展和有效大语言模型驱动渗透测试的一步，还提出三个未来工作方向。

Abstract: Penetration testing is essential for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications before real adversaries can exploit them. Recent work has explored automating this process with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, but existing approaches either rely on a single generic agent that struggles in complex scenarios or narrowly specialized agents that cannot adapt to diverse vulnerability types. We therefore introduce PenForge, a framework that dynamically constructs expert agents during testing rather than relying on those prepared beforehand. By integrating automated reconnaissance of potential attack surfaces with agents instantiated on the fly for context-aware exploitation, PenForge achieves a 30.0% exploit success rate (12/40) on CVE-Bench in the particularly challenging zero-day setting, which is a 3 times improvement over the state-of-the-art. Our analysis also identifies three opportunities for future work: (1) supplying richer tool-usage knowledge to improve exploitation effectiveness; (2) extending benchmarks to include more vulnerabilities and attack types; and (3) fostering developer trust by incorporating explainable mechanisms and human review. As an emerging result with substantial potential impact, PenForge embodies the early-stage yet paradigm-shifting idea of on-the-fly agent construction, marking its promise as a step toward scalable and effective LLM-driven penetration testing.

Motivation: 传统日志解析器难以应对日志语义变化和数据稀缺问题，基于大语言模型的解析器存在示例学习能力未充分利用及查询耗时成本高的挑战。

Method: 提出MicLog框架，采用零样本到k样本的渐进元示例学习范式，结合加权DBSCAN候选采样和改进的BM25示例选择，利用多级预查询缓存加速解析。

Result: 在Loghub - 2.0上评估，MicLog比现有最佳解析器的解析准确率高10.3%，解析时间减少42.4%。

Conclusion: MicLog框架有效解决了基于大语言模型的日志解析器面临的问题，提高了性能。

Abstract: Log parsing converts semi-structured logs into structured templates, forming a critical foundation for downstream analysis. Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates. Evaluated on Loghub-2.0, MicLog achieves 10.3% higher parsing accuracy than the state-of-the-art parser while reducing parsing time by 42.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI工具开始重塑软件工程活动，但在敏捷环境中的采用情况研究不足，本研究旨在调查敏捷实践者在现实组织环境中采用该工具的情况。

Method: 在三个德国组织进行探索性多案例研究，进行17次半结构化访谈和文档分析，采用跨案例主题分析识别采用模式。

Result: 生成式AI主要用于创意任务、文档和代码协助，有提高效率和增强创造力等好处，也存在数据隐私、验证工作和缺乏治理等障碍，障碍源于技术 - 组织 - 环境（TOE）三个维度的失调。

Conclusion: 生成式AI有增强敏捷角色的潜力，但需要跨TOE维度对齐，包括明确政策、数据保护措施和用户培训，以实现负责任和有效的集成。

Abstract: Context: The rapid emergence of generative AI (GenAI) tools has begun to reshape various software engineering activities. Yet, their adoption within agile environments remains underexplored. Objective: This study investigates how agile practitioners adopt GenAI tools in real-world organizational contexts, focusing on regulatory conditions, use cases, benefits, and barriers. Method: An exploratory multiple case study was conducted in three German organizations, involving 17 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. A cross-case thematic analysis was applied to identify GenAI adoption patterns. Results: Findings reveal that GenAI is primarily used for creative tasks, documentation, and code assistance. Benefits include efficiency gains and enhanced creativity, while barriers relate to data privacy, validation effort, and lack of governance. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we find that these barriers stem from misalignments across the three dimensions. Regulatory pressures are often translated into policies without accounting for actual technological usage patterns or organizational constraints. This leads to systematic gaps between policy and practice. Conclusion: GenAI offers significant potential to augment agile roles but requires alignment across TOE dimensions, including clear policies, data protection measures, and user training to ensure responsible and effective integration.

Conclusion: 当前生态既有发展势头又很脆弱，需改进测试、文档和维护以确保长期可靠性和可持续性。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of multi-agent AI systems (MAS), including LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen, has shaped how large language model (LLM) applications are developed and orchestrated. However, little is known about how these systems evolve and are maintained in practice. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of open-source MAS, analyzing over 42K unique commits and over 4.7K resolved issues across eight leading systems. Our analysis identifies three distinct development profiles: sustained, steady, and burst-driven. These profiles reflect substantial variation in ecosystem maturity. Perfective commits constitute 40.8% of all changes, suggesting that feature enhancement is prioritized over corrective maintenance (27.4%) and adaptive updates (24.3%). Data about issues shows that the most frequent concerns involve bugs (22%), infrastructure (14%), and agent coordination challenges (10%). Issue reporting also increased sharply across all frameworks starting in 2023. Median resolution times range from under one day to about two weeks, with distributions skewed toward fast responses but a minority of issues requiring extended attention. These results highlight both the momentum and the fragility of the current ecosystem, emphasizing the need for improved testing infrastructure, documentation quality, and maintenance practices to ensure long-term reliability and sustainability.

Abstract: Decision-making is a core engineering design activity that conveys the engineer's knowledge and translates it into courses of action. Capturing this form of knowledge can reap potential benefits for the engineering teams and enhance development efficiency. Despite its clear value, traditional decision capture often requires a significant amount of effort and still falls short of capturing the necessary context for reuse. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) can be a promising solution to address these challenges by embedding decisions directly within system models, which can reduce the capture workload while maintaining explicit links to requirements, behaviors, and architectural elements. This article discusses a lightweight framework for integrating decision capture into MBSE workflows by representing decision alternatives as system model slices. Using a simplified industry example from aircraft architecture, we discuss the main challenges associated with decision capture and propose preliminary solutions to address these challenges.

Motivation: 现有提升软件公平性方法多为黑箱，无法让利益相关者根据需求平衡公平性和有效性，因此提出FairRF方法。

Method: 在11种不同场景下，将FairRF与26种不同基线进行对比实验，使用5种有效性和3种公平性指标，还分析了6种公平性定义。

Result: FairRF能显著提升基分类器的公平性，保持一致的预测有效性，在所有公平性定义下优化效果更稳定，克服了现有交叉偏差缓解方法。

Conclusion: FairRF是有效缓解偏差的方法，能让利益相关者根据特定需求开发公平软件系统。

Abstract: Background: The wide adoption of AI- and ML-based systems in sensitive domains raises severe concerns about their fairness. Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation. Conclusions: FairRF is an effective approach for bias mitigation also allowing stakeholders to adapt the development of fair software systems based on their specific needs.

Result: 模型句法准确性高但语义有缺陷；Qwen3 - Coder - 30B表现最佳；顶尖模型接近本科生平均水平但远低于顶级人类设计师；参数规模等影响性能，设计复杂度等降低性能；分析出常见失败模式。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在面向对象设计任务上有进步空间，参数规模、代码专业化和指令调优等对性能影响显著。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven extensive evaluations in software engineering. however, most prior work concentrates on code-level tasks, leaving software design capabilities underexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating 29 LLMs on object-oriented design (OOD) tasks. Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it. Bad case analysis reveals common failure modes, including keyword misuse, missing classes or relationships, and omitted methods.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型融入软件开发工作流，开发者在代码注释留下AI参与痕迹，部分显示技术缺陷，需分析其对技术债的影响。

Method: 分析2022年11月至2025年7月公开的基于Python和JavaScript的GitHub仓库中6540条提及LLM的代码注释。

Result: 找出81条自我承认技术债（SATD）的注释，开发者常提及延迟测试、适应性不完全和对AI生成代码理解有限。

Conclusion: 提出GenAI - Induced Self - admitted Technical debt（GIST）概念，用于描述开发者在使用AI生成代码时对其行为或正确性表示不确定的情况。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini become integrated into software development workflows, developers increasingly leave traces of AI involvement in their code comments. Among these, some comments explicitly acknowledge both the use of generative AI and the presence of technical shortcomings. Analyzing 6,540 LLM-referencing code comments from public Python and JavaScript-based GitHub repositories (November 2022-July 2025), we identified 81 that also self-admit technical debt(SATD). Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges. We term GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST) as a proposed conceptual lens to describe recurring cases where developers incorporate AI-generated code while explicitly expressing uncertainty about its behavior or correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂机器学习模型用于金融预测时，其相比简单模型何时表现更优尚不明确，需探究先进信号处理和深度学习技术能否从投资者订单流提取超过简单特征工程的预测价值。

Method: 使用包含2020 - 2024年2439只韩国股票279万条观测数据的综合数据集，采用独立成分分析（ICA）恢复潜在市场驱动因素、小波相干分析表征多尺度相关结构，以及带注意力机制的长短时记忆网络（LSTM）进行非线性预测。

Result: 使用市值归一化流的简约线性模型夏普比率达1.30，累计回报率272.6%；完整的ICA - 小波 - LSTM流程夏普比率仅0.07，累计回报率 - 5.1%；原始LSTM模型预测准确率47.5%，不如随机预测。

Conclusion: 在低信噪比金融环境中，特定领域特征工程比算法复杂性带来更高边际回报，为深度学习在金融预测中的应用设定了重要边界条件。

Abstract: The application of machine learning to financial prediction has accelerated dramatically, yet the conditions under which complex models outperform simple alternatives remain poorly understood. This paper investigates whether advanced signal processing and deep learning techniques can extract predictive value from investor order flows beyond what simple feature engineering achieves. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2.79 million observations spanning 2,439 Korean equities from 2020--2024, we apply three methodologies: \textit{Independent Component Analysis} (ICA) to recover latent market drivers, \textit{Wavelet Coherence} analysis to characterize multi-scale correlation structure, and \textit{Long Short-Term Memory} (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms for non-linear prediction. Our results reveal a striking finding: a parsimonious linear model using market capitalization-normalized flows (``Matched Filter'' preprocessing) achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.30 and cumulative return of 272.6\%, while the full ICA-Wavelet-LSTM pipeline generates a Sharpe ratio of only 0.07 with a cumulative return of $-5.1\%$. The raw LSTM model collapsed to predicting the unconditional mean, achieving a hit rate of 47.5\% -- worse than random. We conclude that in low signal-to-noise financial environments, domain-specific feature engineering yields substantially higher marginal returns than algorithmic complexity. These findings establish important boundary conditions for the application of deep learning to financial prediction.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting.
  We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.

*Zeusu Sato*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 本文在统一概率框架内重新审视延长投资期限和分散投资时机能降低风险的观点，明确了风险和不确定性的定义，分析结果表明上述常见观点存在概念误区，但特定条件下采用这些策略并非非理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 投资教育和实践中声称延长投资期限和分散投资时机可降低风险，但缺乏对风险的精确定义及风险与不确定性的清晰区分，本文旨在重新审视这些观点。

Method: 在统一概率框架下，定义期望层面的风险，引入有效投资暴露概念以进行不同投资期限和日程的有意义比较。

Result: 在固定收益过程中，延长投资期限不改变单位暴露基础上的期望风险、期望回报和风险回报比；不同投资时机策略导致不同暴露情况，一次性投资和成本平均法在相等回报暴露下风险有差异，但差异不随投资期限增加而增大。

Conclusion: 常见的长期投资和成本平均法观点在概念上有误导性，但在预算或时机限制下采用这些策略并非不理性。

Abstract: It is widely claimed in investment education and practice that extending the investment horizon reduces risk, and that diversifying investment timing, for example through dollar-cost averaging (DCA), further mitigates investment risk. Although such claims are intuitively appealing, they are often stated without precise definitions of risk or a clear separation between risk and uncertainty.
  This paper revisits these two beliefs within a unified probabilistic framework. We define risk at the expectation level as a property of the generating distribution of cumulative investment outcomes, and distinguish it from uncertainty, understood as the dispersion of realized outcomes across possible paths. To enable meaningful comparisons across horizons and investment schedules, we introduce the notion of effective investment exposure, defined as time-integrated invested capital.
  Under stationary return processes with finite variance, we show that extending the investment horizon does not alter expected risk, expected return, or the risk-return ratio on a per-unit-exposure basis. In contrast, different investment timing strategies can induce distinct exposure profiles over time. As a result, lump-sum investment and dollar-cost averaging may differ not only in uncertainty but also in expected risk when compared at equal return exposure, although the resulting risk differences are of constant order and do not grow with the investment horizon.
  These results clarify why common narratives surrounding long-horizon investment and dollar-cost averaging are conceptually misleading, while also explaining why adopting such strategies under budgetary or timing constraints need not be regarded as irrational.

Abstract: Financial markets are complex adaptive systems characterized by collective behavior and abrupt regime shifts, particularly during crises. This paper studies time-varying dependencies in Nordic equity markets and examines whether correlation-eigenstructure dynamics can be exploited for regime-aware portfolio construction. Using two decades of daily data for the OMXS30, OMXC20, and OMXH25 universes, pronounced regime dependence in rolling correlation matrices is documented: crisis episodes are characterized by sharp increases in the leading eigenvalue and counter-cyclical behavior in the second eigenvalue. Eigenportfolio regressions further support a market-factor interpretation of the dominant eigenmode. Building on these findings, an adaptive portfolio allocation framework is proposed, combining correlation-matrix cleaning, an eigenvalue-ratio crisis indicator and long-only minimum-variance optimization with constraints that bound exposures to dominant eigenmodes. Backtesting results indicate improved downside protection and risk-adjusted performance during stress regimes, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art benchmarks in tranquil periods.

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了基于网络的风险如何改变经典分散化结果，为将系统连通性纳入投资组合选择提供了透明的理论基础。

Abstract: The classical mean-variance framework characterizes portfolio risk solely through return variance and the covariance matrix, implicitly assuming that all relevant sources of risk are captured by second moments. In modern financial markets, however, shocks often propagate through complex networks of interconnections, giving rise to systemic and spillover risks that variance alone does not reflect.
  This paper develops a unified portfolio optimization framework that incorporates connectedness risk alongside expected return and variance. Using a quadratic measure of network spillovers derived from a connectedness matrix, we formulate a three-objective optimization problem and characterize the resulting three-dimensional efficient surface. We establish existence, uniqueness, and continuity of optimal portfolios under mild regularity conditions and derive closed-form solutions when short-selling is allowed. The trade-off between variance and connectedness is shown to be strictly monotone except in degenerate cases, yielding a well-defined risk-risk frontier.
  Under simultaneous diagonalizability of the covariance and connectedness matrices, we prove a three-fund separation theorem: all efficient portfolios can be expressed as affine combinations of a minimum-variance portfolio, a minimum-connectedness portfolio, and the tangency portfolio. The framework clarifies how network-based risk alters classical diversification results and provides a transparent theoretical foundation for incorporating systemic connectedness into portfolio choice.

Conclusion: 该框架为低违约环境中的信用风险评估提供了连贯且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a meta-learning framework for credit risk assessment of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that explicitly addresses the temporal misalignment of credit scoring models.
  The approach aligns financial statement reference dates with evaluation dates, mitigating bias arising from publication delays and asynchronous data sources. It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays. Empirical validation shows that the framework effectively captures credit risk evolution over time, improving temporal consistency and predictive stability relative to standard ensemble methods.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可从所有观察到的索赔轨迹学习，避免监督方法的局限性，在未决索赔准备金评估中表现良好，尤其适用于推动大部分负债的不成熟索赔段。

Abstract: Outstanding claim liabilities are revised repeatedly as claims develop, yet most modern reserving models are trained as one-shot predictors and typically learn only from settled claims. We formulate individual claims reserving as a claim-level Markov decision process in which an agent sequentially updates outstanding claim liability (OCL) estimates over development, using continuous actions and a reward design that balances accuracy with stable reserve revisions. A key advantage of this reinforcement learning (RL) approach is that it can learn from all observed claim trajectories, including claims that remain open at valuation, thereby avoiding the reduced sample size and selection effects inherent in supervised methods trained on ultimate outcomes only. We also introduce practical components needed for actuarial use -- initialisation of new claims, temporally consistent tuning via a rolling-settlement scheme, and an importance-weighting mechanism to mitigate portfolio-level underestimation driven by the rarity of large claims. On CAS and SPLICE synthetic general insurance datasets, the proposed Soft Actor-Critic implementation delivers competitive claim-level accuracy and strong aggregate OCL performance, particularly for the immature claim segments that drive most of the liability.

Abstract: Stock prediction, a subject closely related to people's investment activities in fully dynamic and live environments, has been widely studied. Current large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, exhibiting expert-level performance through advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. In this paper, we introduce PriceSeer, a live, dynamic, and data-uncontaminated benchmark specifically designed for LLMs performing stock prediction tasks. Specifically, PriceSeer includes 110 U.S. stocks from 11 industrial sectors, with each containing 249 historical data points. Our benchmark implements both internal and external information expansion, where LLMs receive extra financial indicators, news, and fake news to perform stock price prediction. We evaluate six cutting-edge LLMs under different prediction horizons, demonstrating their potential in generating investment strategies after obtaining accurate price predictions for different sectors. Additionally, we provide analyses of LLMs' suboptimal performance in long-term predictions, including the vulnerability to fake news and specific industries. The code and evaluation data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/BobLiang2113/PriceSeer.

Abstract: Current asset pricing research exhibits a significant gap: a lack of sufficient cross-market validation regarding short-term trading-based factors. Against this backdrop, the development of the Chinese A-share market which is characterized by its retail-investor dominance, policy sensitivity, and high-frequency active trading -- has given rise to specific short-term trading-based factors. This study systematically examines the universality of factors from the Alpha191 library in the U.S. market, addressing the challenge of high-dimensional factor screening through the double-selection LASSO algorithm an established method for cross-market, high-dimensional research. After controlling for 151 fundamental factors from the U.S. equity factor zoo, 17 Alpha191 factors selected by this procedure exhibit significant incremental explanatory power for the cross-section of U.S. stock returns at the 5% level. Together these findings demonstrate that short-term trading-based factors, originating from the unique structure of the Chinese A-share market, provide incremental information not captured by existing mainstream pricing models, thereby enhancing the explanation of cross-sectional return differences.

Abstract: A new wave of work on covariance cleaning and nonlinear shrinkage has delivered asymptotically optimal analytical solutions for large covariance matrices. Building on this progress, these ideas have been generalized to empirical cross-covariance matrices, whose singular-value shrinkage characterizes comovements between one set of assets and another. Existing analytical cross-covariance cleaners are derived under strong stationarity and large-sample assumptions, and they typically rely on mesoscopic regularity conditions such as bounded spectra; macroscopic common modes (e.g., a global market factor) violate these conditions. When applied to real equity returns, where dependence structures drift over time and global modes are prominent, we find that these theoretically optimal formulas do not translate into robust out-of-sample performance. We address this gap by designing a random-matrix-inspired neural architecture that operates in the empirical singular-vector basis and learns a nonlinear mapping from empirical singular values to their corresponding cleaned values. By construction, the network can recover the analytical solution as a special case, yet it remains flexible enough to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and mode-driven distortions. Trained on a long history of equity returns, the proposed method achieves a more favorable bias-variance trade-off than purely analytical cleaners and delivers systematically lower out-of-sample cross-covariance prediction errors. Our results demonstrate that combining random-matrix theory with machine learning makes asymptotic theories practically effective in realistic time-varying markets.

Abstract: Applying Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression to the eigenvalue problem $(\mathcal{L}-λ)u = 0$ poses a fundamental challenge, where the null source term results in a trivial predictive mean and a degenerate marginal likelihood. Drawing inspiration from system identification, we construct a transfer function-type indicator for the unknown eigenvalue/eigenfunction using the physics-informed Gaussian Process posterior. We demonstrate that the posterior covariance is only non-trivial when $λ$ corresponds to an eigenvalue of the partial differential operator $\mathcal{L}$, reflecting the existence of a non-trivial eigenspace, and any sample from the posterior lies in the eigenspace of the linear operator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several numerical examples with both linear and non-linear eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment for diffusion models aims to adapt a pre-trained diffusion model toward a target distribution without retraining the base score network, thereby preserving the generative capacity of the base model while enforcing desired properties at the inference time. A central mechanism for achieving such alignment is guidance, which modifies the sampling dynamics through an additional drift term. In this work, we introduce Doob's matching, a novel framework for guidance estimation grounded in Doob's $h$-transform. Our approach formulates guidance as the gradient of logarithm of an underlying Doob's $h$-function and employs gradient-penalized regression to simultaneously estimate both the $h$-function and its gradient, resulting in a consistent estimator of the guidance. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the estimated guidance. Moreover, we analyze the resulting controllable diffusion processes and prove non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the generated distributions in the 2-Wasserstein distance.

Abstract: Individualized treatment regimes (ITRs) aim to improve clinical outcomes by assigning treatment based on patient-specific characteristics. However, existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional covariates, limiting accuracy, interpretability, and real-world applicability. We propose a novel sufficient dimension reduction approach that directly targets the contrast between potential outcomes and identifies a low-dimensional subspace of the covariates capturing treatment effect heterogeneity. This reduced representation enables more accurate estimation of optimal ITRs through outcome-weighted learning. To accommodate observational data, our method incorporates kernel-based covariate balancing, allowing treatment assignment to depend on the full covariate set and avoiding the restrictive assumption that the subspace sufficient for modeling heterogeneous treatment effects is also sufficient for confounding adjustment. We show that the proposed method achieves universal consistency, i.e., its risk converges to the Bayes risk, under mild regularity conditions. We demonstrate its finite sample performance through simulations and an analysis of intensive care unit sepsis patient data to determine who should receive transthoracic echocardiography.

Abstract: The success of deep neural networks largely depends on the statistical structure of the training data. While learning dynamics and generalization on isotropic data are well-established, the impact of pronounced anisotropy on these crucial aspects is not yet fully understood. We examine the impact of data anisotropy, represented by a spiked covariance structure, a canonical yet tractable model, on the learning dynamics and generalization error of a two-layer linear network in a linear regression setting. Our analysis reveals that the learning dynamics proceed in two distinct phases, governed initially by the input-output correlation and subsequently by other principal directions of the data structure. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the generalization error, quantifying how the alignment of the spike structure of the data with the learning task improves performance. Our findings offer deep theoretical insights into how data anisotropy shapes the learning trajectory and final performance, providing a foundation for understanding complex interactions in more advanced network architectures.

Abstract: Matching markets face increasing needs to learn the matching qualities between demand and supply for effective design of matching policies. In practice, the matching rewards are high-dimensional due to the growing diversity of participants. We leverage a natural low-rank matrix structure of the matching rewards in these two-sided markets, and propose to utilize matrix completion to accelerate reward learning with limited offline data. A unique property for matrix completion in this setting is that the entries of the reward matrix are observed with matching interference -- i.e., the entries are not observed independently but dependently due to matching or budget constraints. Such matching dependence renders unique technical challenges, such as sub-optimality or inapplicability of the existing analytical tools in the matrix completion literature, since they typically rely on sample independence. In this paper, we first show that standard nuclear norm regularization remains theoretically effective under matching interference. We provide a near-optimal Frobenius norm guarantee in this setting, coupled with a new analytical technique. Next, to guide certain matching decisions, we develop a novel ``double-enhanced'' estimator, based off the nuclear norm estimator, with a near-optimal entry-wise guarantee. Our double-enhancement procedure can apply to broader sampling schemes even with dependence, which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we extend our approach to online learning settings with matching constraints such as optimal matching and stable matching, and present improved regret bounds in matrix dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our methods using both synthetic data and real data of labor markets.

Abstract: Traditional filtering algorithms for state estimation -- such as classical Kalman filtering, unscented Kalman filtering, and particle filters - show performance degradation when applied to nonlinear systems whose uncertainty follows arbitrary non-Gaussian, and potentially multi-modal distributions. This study reviews recent approaches to state estimation via nonlinear filtering based on conditional normalizing flows, where the conditional embedding is generated by standard MLP architectures, transformers or selective state-space models (like Mamba-SSM). In addition, we test the effectiveness of an optimal-transport-inspired kinetic loss term in mitigating overparameterization in flows consisting of a large collection of transformations. We investigate the performance of these approaches on applications relevant to autonomous driving and patient population dynamics, paying special attention to how they handle time inversion and chained predictions.

Conclusion: Local EGOP学习算法能适应感兴趣函数的规律性，具有较好的学习和回归效果。

Abstract: We introduce the setting of continuous index learning, in which a function of many variables varies only along a small number of directions at each point. For efficient estimation, it is beneficial for a learning algorithm to adapt, near each point $x$, to the subspace that captures the local variability of the function $f$. We pose this task as kernel adaptation along a manifold with noise, and introduce Local EGOP learning, a recursive algorithm that utilizes the Expected Gradient Outer Product (EGOP) quadratic form as both a metric and inverse-covariance of our target distribution. We prove that Local EGOP learning adapts to the regularity of the function of interest, showing that under a supervised noisy manifold hypothesis, intrinsic dimensional learning rates are achieved for arbitrarily high-dimensional noise. Empirically, we compare our algorithm to the feature learning capabilities of deep learning. Additionally, we demonstrate improved regression quality compared to two-layer neural networks in the continuous single-index setting.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in matching algorithms is a key challenge in allocating scarce resources and positions. Focusing on Optimal Transport (OT), we introduce a novel notion of group fairness requiring that the probability of matching two individuals from any two given groups in the OT plan satisfies a predefined target. We first propose \texttt{FairSinkhorn}, a modified Sinkhorn algorithm to compute perfectly fair transport plans efficiently. Since exact fairness can significantly degrade matching quality in practice, we then develop two relaxation strategies. The first one involves solving a penalised OT problem, for which we derive novel finite-sample complexity guarantees. This result is of independent interest as it can be generalized to arbitrary convex penalties. Our second strategy leverages bilevel optimization to learn a ground cost that induces a fair OT solution, and we establish a bound guaranteeing that the learned cost yields fair matchings on unseen data. Finally, we present empirical results that illustrate the trade-offs between fairness and performance.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Learning models that can handle distribution shifts is a key challenge in domain generalization. Invariance learning, an approach that focuses on identifying features invariant across environments, improves model generalization by capturing stable relationships, which may represent causal effects when the data distribution is encoded within a structural equation model (SEM) and satisfies modularity conditions. This has led to a growing body of work that builds on invariance learning, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity across environments to develop methods that provide causal explanations while enhancing robust prediction. However, in many practical scenarios, obtaining complete outcome data from each environment is challenging due to the high cost or complexity of data collection. This limitation in available data hinders the development of models that fully leverage environmental heterogeneity, making it crucial to address missing outcomes to improve both causal insights and robust prediction. In this work, we derive an estimator from the invariance objective under missing outcomes. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees on variable selection property and $\ell_2$ error convergence rates, which are influenced by the proportion of missing data and the quality of imputation models across environments. We evaluate the performance of the new estimator through extensive simulations and demonstrate its application using the UCI Bike Sharing dataset to predict the count of bike rentals. The results show that despite relying on a biased imputation model, the estimator is efficient and achieves lower prediction error, provided the bias is within a reasonable range.

Conclusion: CovRT在解决过拟合问题上比CART的经验风险最小化准则更稳健，预测准确性相当甚至更优。

Abstract: Decision trees are powerful machine learning algorithms, widely used in fields such as economics and medicine for their simplicity and interpretability. However, decision trees such as CART are prone to overfitting, especially when grown deep or the sample size is small. Conventional methods to reduce overfitting include pre-pruning and post-pruning, which constrain the growth of uninformative branches. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach by introducing a covariance-driven splitting criterion for regression trees (CovRT). This method is more robust to overfitting than the empirical risk minimization criterion used in CART, as it produces more balanced and stable splits and more effectively identifies covariates with true signals. We establish an oracle inequality of CovRT and prove that its predictive accuracy is comparable to that of CART in high-dimensional settings. We find that CovRT achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to CART in both simulations and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: 这是ρ - 后验推理首个有严格有限样本保证的实际实现方法

Abstract: The $ρ$-posterior framework provides universal Bayesian estimation with explicit contamination rates and optimal convergence guarantees, but has remained computationally difficult due to an optimization over reference distributions that precludes intractable posterior computation. We develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that recovers these theoretical guarantees through temperature-dependent Gibbs posteriors, deriving finite-sample oracle inequalities with explicit rates and introducing tractable variational approximations that inherit the robustness properties of exact $ρ$-posteriors. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves theoretical contamination rates while remaining computationally feasible, providing the first practical implementation of $ρ$-posterior inference with rigorous finite-sample guarantees.

Abstract: Over-smoothing and over-squashing have been extensively studied in the literature on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over the past years. We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation.

Abstract: Clustering with bandit feedback refers to the problem of partitioning a set of items, where the clustering algorithm can sequentially query the items to receive noisy observations. The problem is formally posed as the task of partitioning the arms of an N-armed stochastic bandit according to their underlying distributions, grouping two arms together if and only if they share the same distribution, using samples collected sequentially and adaptively. This setting has gained attention in recent years due to its applicability in recommendation systems and crowdsourcing. Existing works on clustering with bandit feedback rely on a strong assumption that the underlying distributions are sub-Gaussian. As a consequence, the existing methods mainly cover settings with linearly-separable clusters, which has little practical relevance. We introduce a framework of ``nonparametric clustering with bandit feedback'', where the underlying arm distributions are not constrained to any parametric, and hence, it is applicable for active clustering of real-world datasets. We adopt a kernel-based approach, which allows us to reformulate the nonparametric problem as the task of clustering the arms according to their kernel mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Building on this formulation, we introduce the KABC algorithm with theoretical correctness guarantees and analyze its sampling budget. We introduce a notion of signal-to-noise ratio for this problem that depends on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the arm distributions and on their variance in the RKHS. Our algorithm is adaptive to this unknown quantity: it does not require it as an input yet achieves instance-dependent guarantees.

Abstract: This paper develops an approach for multi-step forecasting of dynamical systems by integrating probabilistic input forecasting with physics-informed output prediction. Accurate multi-step forecasting of time series systems is important for the automatic control and optimization of physical processes, enabling more precise decision-making. While mechanistic-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed for time series forecasting, they face significant limitations. Incomplete knowledge of process mathematical models limits mechanistic-based direct employment, while purely data-driven ML models struggle with dynamic environments, leading to poor generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-level strategy for physics-informed forecasting of dynamical systems. On the first level, input variables are forecast using a hybrid method that integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) network into probabilistic state transition models (STMs). On the second level, these stochastically predicted inputs are sequentially fed into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to generate multi-step output predictions. The experimental results of the paper demonstrate that the hybrid input forecasting models achieve a higher log-likelihood and lower mean squared errors (MSE) compared to conventional STMs. Furthermore, the PINNs driven by the input forecasting models outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of MSE and log-likelihood, exhibiting stronger generalization and forecasting performance across multiple test cases.

Abstract: In large-scale statistical modeling, reducing data size through subsampling is essential for balancing computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. We propose a new method, Principal Component Analysis guided Quantile Sampling (PCA-QS), which projects data onto principal components and applies quantile-based sampling to retain representative and diverse subsets. Compared with uniform random sampling, leverage score sampling, and coreset methods, PCA-QS consistently achieves lower mean squared error and better preservation of key data characteristics, while also being computationally efficient. This approach is adaptable to a variety of data scenarios and shows strong potential for broad applications in statistical computing.

Conclusion: 不同的Gibbs采样器变体在谱性质继承上有特定规律，并非所有变体间都能继承几何遍历性或谱间隙。

Abstract: Connections of a spectral nature are formed between Gibbs samplers and their blocked and collapsed variants. The solidarity principle of the spectral gap for full Gibbs samplers is generalized to different cycles and mixtures of Gibbs steps. This generalized solidarity principle is employed to establish that every cycle and mixture of Gibbs steps, which includes blocked Gibbs samplers and collapsed Gibbs samplers, inherits a spectral gap from a full Gibbs sampler. Exact relations between the spectra corresponding to blocked and collapsed variants of a Gibbs sampler are also established. An example is given to show that a blocked or collapsed Gibbs sampler does not in general inherit geometric ergodicity or a spectral gap from another blocked or collapsed Gibbs sampler.

Abstract: Marginal effects analysis is fundamental to interpreting statistical models, yet existing implementations face computational constraints that limit analysis at scale. We introduce two Julia packages that address this gap. Margins.jl provides a clean two-function API organizing analysis around a 2-by-2 framework: evaluation context (population vs profile) by analytical target (effects vs predictions). The package supports interaction analysis through second differences, elasticity measures, categorical mixtures for representative profiles, and robust standard errors. FormulaCompiler.jl provides the computational foundation, transforming statistical formulas into zero-allocation, type-specialized evaluators that enable O(p) per-row computation independent of dataset size. Together, these packages achieve 622x average speedup and 460x memory reduction compared to R's marginaleffects package, with successful computation of average marginal effects and delta-method standard errors on 500,000 observations where R fails due to memory exhaustion, providing the first comprehensive and efficient marginal effects implementation for Julia's statistical ecosystem.

Abstract: The identification of patient subgroups with comparable event-risk dynamics plays a key role in supporting informed decision-making in clinical research. In such settings, it is important to account for the inherent dependence that arises when individuals are nested within higher-level units, such as hospitals. Existing survival models account for group-level heterogeneity through frailty terms but do not uncover latent patient subgroups, while most clustering methods ignore hierarchical structure and are not estimated jointly with survival outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new framework that simultaneously performs patient clustering and shared-frailty survival modeling through a penalized likelihood approach. The proposed methodology adaptively learns a patient-to-patient similarity matrix via a modified version of spectral clustering, enabling cluster formation directly from estimated risk profiles while accounting for group membership. A simulation study highlights the proposed model's ability to recover latent clusters and to correctly estimate hazard parameters. We apply our method to a large cohort of heart-failure patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 2020 and 2021 in the Lombardy region (Italy), identifying clinically meaningful subgroups characterized by distinct risk profiles and highlighting the role of respiratory comorbidities and hospital-level variability in shaping mortality outcomes. This framework provides a flexible and interpretable tool for risk-based patient stratification in hierarchical data settings.

Abstract: Indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) are essential in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) when head-to-head clinical trials are absent. A common challenge arises when attempting to compare a treatment with available individual patient data (IPD) against a competitor with only reported aggregate-level data (ALD), particularly when trial populations differ in effect modifiers. While methods such as Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) and Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC) exist to adjust for these cross-trial differences, software implementations have often been fragmented or limited in scope. This article introduces outstandR, an R package designed to provide a comprehensive and unified framework for population-adjusted indirect comparison (PAIC). Beyond standard weighting and regression approaches, outstandR implements advanced G-computation methods within both maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, and Multiple Imputation Marginalization (MIM) to address non-collapsibility and missing data. By streamlining the workflow of covariate simulation, model standardization, and contrast estimation, outstandR enables robust and compatible evidence synthesis in complex decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion: CVST框架结合MR - VLRC方案在MIMO信道下的无线视频传输中表现出色，具有更好的性能和部署灵活性。

Abstract: The evolution of semantic communications has profoundly impacted wireless video transmission, whose applications dominate driver of modern bandwidth consumption. However, most existing schemes are predominantly optimized for simple additive white Gaussian noise or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the ubiquitous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environments that critically hinder practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose the context video semantic transmission (CVST) framework under MIMO channels. Building upon an efficient contextual video transmission backbone, CVST effectively learns a context-channel correlation map to explicitly formulate the relationships between feature groups and MIMO subchannels. Leveraging these channel-aware features, we design a multi-reference entropy coding mechanism, enabling channel state-aware variable length coding. Furthermore, CVST incorporates a checkerboard-based feature modulation strategy to achieve multiple rate points within a single trained model, thereby enhancing deployment flexibility. These innovations constitute our multi-reference variable length and rate coding (MR-VLRC) scheme. By integrating contextual transmission with MR-VLRC, CVST demonstrates substantial performance gains over various standardized separated coding methods and recent wireless video semantic communication approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/xie233333/CVST.

Abstract: Jamming attacks pose a critical threat to wireless networks, particularly in cell-free massive MIMO systems, where distributed access points and user equipment (UE) create complex, time-varying topologies. This paper proposes a novel jamming detection framework leveraging dynamic graphs and graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to address this challenge. By modeling the network as a dynamic graph, we capture evolving communication links and detect jamming attacks as anomalies in the graph evolution. A GCN-Transformer-based model, trained with supervised learning, learns graph embeddings to identify malicious interference. Performance evaluation in simulated scenarios with moving UEs, varying jamming conditions and channel fadings, demonstrates the method's effectiveness, which is assessed through accuracy and F1 score metrics, achieving promising results for effective jamming detection.

Abstract: This work aims to rigorously define the values of perception, prediction, communication, and common sense in decision making. The defined quantities are decision-theoretic, but have information-theoretic analogues, e.g., they share some simple but key mathematical properties with Shannon entropy and mutual information, and can reduce to these quantities in particular settings. One interesting observation is that, the value of perception without prediction can be negative, while the value of perception together with prediction and the value of prediction alone are always nonnegative. The defined quantities suggest answers to practical questions arising in the design of autonomous decision-making systems. Example questions include: Do we need to observe and predict the behavior of a particular agent? How important is it? What is the best order to observe and predict the agents? The defined quantities may also provide insights to cognitive science and neural science, toward the understanding of how natural decision makers make use of information gained from different sources and operations.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning based solution for jamming communications using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum technology in a 16 channel radio environment is presented. Deep Q Network based transmitter continuously selects the next frequency hopping channel while facing first order reactive jamming, which uses observed transition statistics to predict and interrupt transmissions. Through self training, the proposed agent learns a uniform random frequency hopping policy that effectively neutralizes the predictive advantage of the jamming. In the presence of Rayleigh fading and additive noise, the impact of forward error correction Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem type codes is systematically evaluated, demonstrating that even moderate redundancy significantly reduces packet loss. Extensive visualization of the learning dynamics, channel utilization distribution, epsilon greedy decay, cumulative reward, BER and SNR evolution, and detailed packet loss tables confirms convergence to a near optimal jamming strategy. The results provide a practical framework for autonomous resilient communications in modern electronic warfare scenarios.

TL;DR: 为解决环境感知无线网络中通道知识地图（CKM）构建难题，本文引入基于线性传输引导流匹配（LT - GFM）的框架，模拟CKM生成过程为确定性常微分方程，适用于多种地图构建，模拟结果显示其有高分布保真度和快推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法在构建CKM时依赖迭代随机采样，速度慢无法满足实时无线应用需求，需在高保真和高效CKM构建间找到平衡。

Method: 引入基于LT - GFM的框架，将CKM生成过程建模为确定性常微分方程，采用统一架构，适用于多种地图构建，集成环境语义和强制厄米对称性实现物理信息的CKM构建。

Result: 模拟结果表明，LT - GFM实现了优越的分布保真度，弗雷歇初始距离（FID）显著降低，与DDPMs相比推理速度提高了25倍。

Conclusion: LT - GFM能在有效缩短推理步骤的同时，实现较高的CKM构建分布保真度，适用于多种地图构建。

Abstract: The efficient construction of accurate channel knowledge maps (CKMs) is crucial for unleashing the full potential of environment-aware wireless networks, yet it remains a difficult ill-posed problem due to the sparsity of available location-specific channel knowledge data. Although diffusion-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been exploited for CKM construction, they rely on iterative stochastic sampling, rendering them too slow for real-time wireless applications. To bridge the gap between high fidelity and efficient CKM construction, this letter introduces a novel framework based on linear transport guided flow matching (LT-GFM). Deviating from the noise-removal paradigm of diffusion models, our approach models the CKM generation process as a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) that follows linear optimal transport paths, thereby drastically reducing the number of required inference steps. We propose a unified architecture that is applicable to not only the conventional channel gain map (CGM) construction, but also the more challenging spatial correlation map (SCM) construction. To achieve physics-informed CKM constructions, we integrate environmental semantics (e.g., building masks) for edge recovery and enforce Hermitian symmetry for property of the SCM. Simulation results verify that LT-GFM achieves superior distributional fidelity with significantly lower Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and accelerates inference speed by a factor of 25 compared to DDPMs.

Motivation: Transformer信道解码器如ECCT在信道解码中经验性能强，但泛化行为理论不明，因此研究ECCT的泛化性能。

Method: 建立乘性噪声估计误差和误码率的联系，通过逐位Rademacher复杂度推导泛化误差上界；分析基于奇偶校验的掩码注意力的稀疏性。

Result: 所推导的边界刻画了其与码长、模型参数和训练集大小的依赖关系，适用于单层和多层ECCT；基于奇偶校验的掩码注意力能减少覆盖数，使泛化边界更紧。

Conclusion: 本工作首次为此类解码器提供了理论泛化保证。

Abstract: Transformer channel decoders, such as the Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT), have shown strong empirical performance in channel decoding, yet their generalization behavior remains theoretically unclear. This paper studies the generalization performance of ECCT from a learning-theoretic perspective. By establishing a connection between multiplicative noise estimation errors and bit-error-rate (BER), we derive an upper bound on the generalization gap via bit-wise Rademacher complexity. The resulting bound characterizes the dependence on code length, model parameters, and training set size, and applies to both single-layer and multi-layer ECCTs. We further show that parity-check-based masked attention induces sparsity that reduces the covering number, leading to a tighter generalization bound. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first theoretical generalization guarantees for this class of decoders.

Abstract: Generative AI systems often display highly uneven performance across tasks that appear ``nearby'': they can be excellent on one prompt and confidently wrong on another with only small changes in wording or context. We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about \emph{local} reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model ``knows'' scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering ``where the model works'' is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible.

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Event Graphs (SEG)处理长视频问答，在多视频多问题上验证效果，展示符号时间图优势并将开源相关内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型处理长视频问答时难以在实用令牌和计算预算内对长时间素材推理，现有系统在时间覆盖和成本间权衡。

Method: 利用YOLOv11检测和跟踪对象，将邻近模式转换为事件并组织成Temporal Scene Graph (TSG)，推理时用查询感知修剪模块识别相关事件，将小的子图语言化后传给Gemini 2.5 Flash生成答案。

Result: 在5个YouTube视频和120个自动生成问题上，SEG准确率65.0%，仅用3.47k令牌，相比全日志基线减少91.4%令牌使用；短上下文基线准确率仅2.5%。

Conclusion: 符号时间图可作为现成视觉语言模型的有效即插即用记忆层，在长视频问答中保持长距离推理能力，大幅提高令牌和成本效率。

Abstract: Long-form video question answering remains challenging for modern vision-language models, which struggle to reason over hour-scale footage without exceeding practical token and compute budgets. Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient. Code, logs, and event-extraction tools will be released for reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有工作在利用视觉语言模型辅助强化学习时，忽略了强化学习生成的交互数据对视觉语言模型的提升潜力。

Method: 提出COVR框架，用强化学习生成的数据微调视觉语言模型，再用增强后的视觉语言模型通过动作先验指导策略学习；引入探索驱动动态过滤模块和回报感知自适应损失权重模块，设计渐进式微调策略。

Result: COVR在各种具有挑战性的视觉控制任务中取得了良好的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的COVR框架能有效实现视觉语言模型和强化学习策略的相互增强，提升视觉强化学习性能。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from poor sample efficiency due to high-dimensional observations in complex tasks. While existing works have shown that vision-language models (VLMs) can assist RL, they often focus on knowledge distillation from the VLM to RL, overlooking the potential of RL-generated interaction data to enhance the VLM. To address this, we propose COVR, a collaborative optimization framework that enables the mutual enhancement of the VLM and RL policies. Specifically, COVR fine-tunes the VLM with RL-generated data to enhance the semantic reasoning ability consistent with the target task, and uses the enhanced VLM to further guide policy learning via action priors. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL. We further design a progressive fine-tuning strategy to reduce resource consumption. Extensive experiments show that COVR achieves strong performance across various challenging visual control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉 - 语言基准的问题多结构良好、提示明确，而实际用户查询常不规范、信息不足，需新基准评估模型在真实情况的表现。

Method: 引入HAERAE - Vision基准，包含653个来自韩国在线社区的真实视觉问题及对应改写，评估39个VLM，并对比查询明确化和网络搜索的效果。

Result: 即使是最先进模型对原始查询准确率不足50%，查询明确化可提升8 - 22个百分点，小模型受益最大，未搜索的明确查询比有搜索的不明确查询表现好。

Conclusion: VLM的困难很大程度源于自然查询的不明确，而非模型能力，当前基准评估与实际部署有差距。

Abstract: Current vision-language benchmarks predominantly feature well-structured questions with clear, explicit prompts. However, real user queries are often informal and underspecified. Users naturally leave much unsaid, relying on images to convey context. We introduce HAERAE-Vision, a benchmark of 653 real-world visual questions from Korean online communities (0.76% survival from 86K candidates), each paired with an explicit rewrite, yielding 1,306 query variants in total. Evaluating 39 VLMs, we find that even state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieve under 50% on the original queries. Crucially, query explicitation alone yields 8 to 22 point improvements, with smaller models benefiting most. We further show that even with web search, under-specified queries underperform explicit queries without search, revealing that current retrieval cannot compensate for what users leave unsaid. Our findings demonstrate that a substantial portion of VLM difficulty stem from natural query under-specification instead of model capability, highlighting a critical gap between benchmark evaluation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: We present Akasha 2, a state-of-the-art multimodal architecture that integrates Hamiltonian State Space Duality (H-SSD) with Visual-Language Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (VL-JEPA). The system leverages the Mamba-3 Selective State Space Model (SSM) augmented by a Sparse Mixture of Hamiltonian Experts (SMoE-HE) that enforces latent physical conservation laws through symplectic integration. For visual synthesis, we introduce Hamiltonian Flow Matching (HFM) and persistent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling ultra-low latency (<50ms) on mobile hardware. This work establishes a new paradigm in latent world models, achieving unprecedented spatiotemporal coherence through a holographic memory architecture. Our approach demonstrates that incorporating physics-inspired inductive biases into neural architectures yields significant improvements: state-of-the-art video prediction (FVD: 287), 4x faster visual synthesis than diffusion models, and 3-18x inference speedup over transformer baselines while maintaining energy conservation over extended horizons.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has raised concerns about their potential to generate copyrighted, inappropriate, or sensitive imagery learned from massive training corpora. As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm. Extensive experiments across three distinct unlearning tasks demonstrate that FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning, improving forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality.

Result: 在多个公共基准上的大量实验表明，SAPL显著优于现有方法，实现了最先进的定位性能。

Conclusion: SAPL方法在恶意图像篡改定位方面有效且性能优越。

Abstract: Malicious image manipulation threatens public safety and requires efficient localization methods. Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance.

Abstract: The scarcity and low diversity of well-annotated automotive radar datasets often limit the performance of deep-learning-based environmental perception. To overcome these challenges, we propose a conditional generative framework for synthesizing realistic Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar Range-Azimuth Maps. Our approach leverages a generative diffusion model to generate radar data for multiple object categories, including pedestrians, cars, and cyclists. Specifically, conditioning is achieved via Confidence Maps, where each channel represents a semantic class and encodes Gaussian-distributed annotations at target locations. To address radar-specific characteristics, we incorporate Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization into the generative process. Experiments on the ROD2021 dataset demonstrate that signal reconstruction quality improves by \SI{3.6}{dB} in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods, while training with a combination of real and synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared with conventional image-processing-based augmentation. These results indicate that our generative framework not only produces physically plausible and diverse radar spectrum but also substantially improves model generalization in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Training video-language models is often prohibitively expensive due to the high cost of processing long frame sequences and the limited availability of annotated long videos. We present VideoWeave, a simple yet effective approach to improve data efficiency by constructing synthetic long-context training samples that splice together short, captioned videos from existing datasets. Rather than modifying model architectures or optimization objectives, VideoWeave reorganizes available video-text pairs to expand temporal diversity within fixed compute. We systematically study how different data composition strategies like random versus visually clustered splicing and caption enrichment affect downstream performance on downstream video question answering. Under identical compute constraints, models trained with VideoWeave achieve higher accuracy than conventional video finetuning. Our results highlight that reorganizing training data, rather than altering architectures, may offer a simple and scalable path for training video-language models. We link our code for all experiments here.

Abstract: Understanding student behavior in the classroom is essential to improve both pedagogical quality and student engagement. Existing methods for predicting student engagement typically require substantial annotated data to model the diversity of student behaviors, yet privacy concerns often restrict researchers to their own proprietary datasets. Moreover, the classroom context, represented in peers' actions, is ignored. To address the aforementioned limitation, we propose a novel three-stage framework for video-based student engagement measurement. First, we explore the few-shot adaptation of the vision-language model for student action recognition, which is fine-tuned to distinguish among action categories with a few training samples. Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments. Each segment is assigned an action category via the fine-tuned VLM model, generating a sequence of action predictions. Finally, we leverage the large language model to classify this entire sequence of actions, together with the classroom context, as belonging to an engaged or disengaged student. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying student engagement.

Abstract: Modern computer vision architectures, from CNNs to Transformers, predominantly rely on the stacking of heuristic modules: spatial mixers (Attention/Conv) followed by channel mixers (FFNs). In this work, we challenge this paradigm by returning to mathematical first principles. We propose the \textbf{Clifford Algebra Network (CAN)}, also referred to as CliffordNet, a vision backbone grounded purely in Geometric Algebra. Instead of engineering separate modules for mixing and memory, we derive a unified interaction mechanism based on the \textbf{Clifford Geometric Product} ($uv = u \cdot v + u \wedge v$). This operation ensures algebraic completeness regarding the Geometric Product by simultaneously capturing feature coherence (via the generalized inner product) and structural variation (via the exterior wedge product).
  Implemented via an efficient sparse rolling mechanism with \textbf{strict linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(N)$}, our model reveals a surprising emergent property: the geometric interaction is so representationally dense that standard Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) become redundant. Empirically, CliffordNet establishes a new Pareto frontier: our \textbf{Nano} variant achieves \textbf{76.41\%} accuracy on CIFAR-100 with only \textbf{1.4M} parameters, effectively matching the heavy-weight ResNet-18 (11.2M) with \textbf{$8\times$ fewer parameters}, while our \textbf{Base} variant sets a new SOTA for tiny models at \textbf{78.05\%}. Our results suggest that global understanding can emerge solely from rigorous, algebraically complete local interactions, potentially signaling a shift where \textit{geometry is all you need}.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications that require reliable visual grounding. However, these models often hallucinate details that are not present in the image to satisfy user prompts. While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效集成VLMs和语义占用范式，传统VLMs有令牌爆炸和时空推理受限问题，语义占用难以与VLMs高效集成。

Method: 提出SparseOccVLA模型，从轻量级稀疏占用编码器生成占用查询，映射到语言空间由LLM推理，还引入LLM引导的锚定 - 扩散规划器。

Result: 在OmniDrive - nuScenes上CIDEr相对提升7%，在Occ3D - nuScenes上mIoU分数提升0.5，在nuScenes基准上达到最先进的开环规划指标。

Conclusion: SparseOccVLA具有强大的整体能力。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level reasoning , whereas semantic occupancy provides fine-grained details. Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability.

Conclusion: VVTRec能在不引入过多计算开销的情况下，通过利用多模态信息提升成像效果。

Abstract: Radio astronomy is an indispensable discipline for observing distant celestial objects. Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement. Our experiments demonstrate that VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead.

Conclusion: 所提零样本框架能在不使用动物表情数据的情况下，实现人类到动物的面部表情迁移。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot framework for transferring human facial expressions to 3D animal face meshes. Our method combines intrinsic geometric descriptors (HKS/WKS) with a mesh-agnostic latent embedding that disentangles facial identity and expression. The ID latent space captures species-independent facial structure, while the expression latent space encodes deformation patterns that generalize across humans and animals. Trained only with human expression pairs, the model learns the embeddings, decoupling, and recoupling of cross-identity expressions, enabling expression transfer without requiring animal expression data. To enforce geometric consistency, we employ Jacobian loss together with vertex-position and Laplacian losses. Experiments show that our approach achieves plausible cross-species expression transfer, effectively narrowing the geometric gap between human and animal facial shapes.

Conclusion: LLMTrack框架有效可行，能解决传统多目标跟踪系统的不足，实现语义多目标跟踪的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) systems have achieved remarkable precision in localization and association, effectively answering \textit{where} and \textit{who}. However, they often function as autistic observers, capable of tracing geometric paths but blind to the semantic \textit{what} and \textit{why} behind object behaviors. To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.

Abstract: Organoids, sophisticated in vitro models of human tissues, are crucial for medical research due to their ability to simulate organ functions and assess drug responses accurately. Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training. By addressing overlap at both pseudo-label and synthesis levels, our work advances scalable, label-efficient organoid analysis, unlocking new potential for high-throughput applications in precision medicine.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models enhance understanding and interaction with audiovisual content, making it more accessible, searchable, and useful for a wide range of fields such as education, surveillance, entertainment, and content creation. Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \textbf{4\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling. Qualitative analysis further highlights that query-based selection, using SMI functions, consistently picks frames better aligned with the question. We opine that such query-based frame selection can enhance accuracy in a wide range of tasks that rely on only a subset of video frames.

Abstract: Iris recognition is a mature biometric technology offering remarkable precision and speed, and allowing for large-scale deployments to populations exceeding a billion enrolled users (e.g., AADHAAR in India). However, in forensic applications, a human expert may be needed to review and confirm a positive identification before an iris matching result can be presented as evidence in court, especially in cases where processed samples are degraded (e.g., in post-mortem cases) or where there is a need to judge whether the sample is authentic, rather than a result of a presentation attack.
  This paper presents a study that examines human performance in iris verification in two controlled scenarios: (a) under varying pupil sizes, with and without a linear/nonlinear alignment of the pupil size between compared images, and (b) when both genuine and impostor iris image pairs are synthetically generated. The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.
  We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works.

Conclusion: 现有多模态大语言模型在以自我为中心的临床意图理解方面有待提升。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) require egocentric clinical intent understanding for real-world deployment, yet existing benchmarks fail to evaluate this critical capability. To address these challenges, we introduce MedGaze-Bench, the first benchmark leveraging clinician gaze as a Cognitive Cursor to assess intent understanding across surgery, emergency simulation, and diagnostic interpretation. Our benchmark addresses three fundamental challenges: visual homogeneity of anatomical structures, strict temporal-causal dependencies in clinical workflows, and implicit adherence to safety protocols. We propose a Three-Dimensional Clinical Intent Framework evaluating: (1) Spatial Intent: discriminating precise targets amid visual noise, (2) Temporal Intent: inferring causal rationale through retrospective and prospective reasoning, and (3) Standard Intent: verifying protocol compliance through safety checks. Beyond accuracy metrics, we introduce Trap QA mechanisms to stress-test clinical reliability by penalizing hallucinations and cognitive sycophancy. Experiments reveal current MLLMs struggle with egocentric intent due to over-reliance on global features, leading to fabricated observations and uncritical acceptance of invalid instructions.

Result: SpatialNav在离散和连续环境的综合实验中显著优于现有的零样本智能体，缩小了与最先进的基于学习的方法的差距。

Conclusion: 全局空间表征对可泛化导航至关重要。

Abstract: Although learning-based vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents can learn spatial knowledge implicitly from large-scale training data, zero-shot VLN agents lack this process, relying primarily on local observations for navigation, which leads to inefficient exploration and a significant performance gap. To deal with the problem, we consider a zero-shot VLN setting that agents are allowed to fully explore the environment before task execution. Then, we construct the Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to explicitly capture global spatial structure and semantics in the explored environment. Based on the SSG, we introduce SpatialNav, a zero-shot VLN agent that integrates an agent-centric spatial map, a compass-aligned visual representation, and a remote object localization strategy for efficient navigation. Comprehensive experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents and clearly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Such results highlight the importance of global spatial representations for generalizable navigation.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides robust all-weather imaging capabilities; however, translating SAR observations into photo-realistic optical images remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem. Current approaches are often hindered by the inherent speckle noise and geometric distortions of SAR data, which frequently result in semantic misinterpretation, ambiguous texture synthesis, and structural hallucinations. To address these limitations, a novel SAR-to-Optical (S2O) translation framework is proposed, integrating three core technical contributions: (i) Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment, which establishes an Optical-Aware SAR Encoder by distilling robust semantic priors from an Optical Teacher into a SAR Student (ii) Semantically-Grounded Generative Guidance, realized by a Semantically-Grounded ControlNet that integrates class-aware text prompts for global context with hierarchical visual prompts for local spatial guidance; and (iii) an Uncertainty-Aware Objective, which explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty to dynamically modulate the reconstruction focus, effectively mitigating artifacts caused by speckle-induced ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: MedGround是将医学语言与可验证视觉证据关联的可扩展、数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can generate convincing clinical narratives, yet frequently struggle to visually ground their statements. We posit this limitation arises from the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale clinical referring-localization pairs. To address this, we introduce MedGround, an automated pipeline that transforms segmentation resources into high-quality medical referring grounding data. Leveraging expert masks as spatial anchors, MedGround precisely derives localization targets, extracts shape and spatial cues, and guides VLMs to synthesize natural, clinically grounded queries that reflect morphology and location. To ensure data rigor, a multi-stage verification system integrates strict formatting checks, geometry- and medical-prior rules, and image-based visual judging to filter out ambiguous or visually unsupported samples. Finally, we present MedGround-35K, a novel multimodal medical dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLMs trained with MedGround-35K consistently achieve improved referring grounding performance, enhance multi-object semantic disambiguation, and exhibit strong generalization to unseen grounding settings. This work highlights MedGround as a scalable, data-driven approach to anchor medical language to verifiable visual evidence. Dataset and code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

Result: 提出的显著性方法在VGG16和Resnet18网络的ImageNet - S数据集上，在所有Quantus显著性指标类别上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 单调性可通过上述两种方式提升神经网络的可解释性。

Abstract: It has been demonstrated in various contexts that monotonicity leads to better explainability in neural networks. However, not every function can be well approximated by a monotone neural network. We demonstrate that monotonicity can still be used in two ways to boost explainability. First, we use an adaptation of the decomposition of a trained ReLU network into two monotone and convex parts, thereby overcoming numerical obstacles from an inherent blowup of the weights in this procedure. Our proposed saliency methods -- SplitCAM and SplitLRP -- improve on state of the art results on both VGG16 and Resnet18 networks on ImageNet-S across all Quantus saliency metric categories. Second, we exhibit that training a model as the difference between two monotone neural networks results in a system with strong self-explainability properties.

Abstract: We present MixRI, a lightweight network that solves the CAD-based novel object pose estimation problem in RGB images. It can be instantly applied to a novel object at test time without finetuning. We design our network to meet the demands of real-world applications, emphasizing reduced memory requirements and fast inference time. Unlike existing works that utilize many reference images and have large network parameters, we directly match points based on the multi-view information between the query and reference images with a lightweight network. Thanks to our reference image fusion strategy, we significantly decrease the number of reference images, thus decreasing the time needed to process these images and the memory required to store them. Furthermore, with our lightweight network, our method requires less inference time. Though with fewer reference images, experiments on seven core datasets in the BOP challenge show that our method achieves comparable results with other methods that require more reference images and larger network parameters.

Conclusion: 强调针对多模态模型社会偏差评估需进行可控的反事实审计，任务设计是关键因素。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in socially consequential settings, raising concerns about social bias driven by demographic cues. A central challenge in measuring such social bias is attribution under visual confounding: real-world images entangle race and gender with correlated factors such as background and clothing, obscuring attribution. We propose a \textbf{face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm} that isolates demographic effects while preserving real-image realism. Starting from real photographs, we generate counterfactual variants by editing only facial attributes related to race and gender, keeping all other visual factors fixed. Based on this paradigm, we construct \textbf{FOCUS}, a dataset of 480 scene-matched counterfactual images across six occupations and ten demographic groups, and propose \textbf{REFLECT}, a benchmark comprising three decision-oriented tasks: two-alternative forced choice, multiple-choice socioeconomic inference, and numeric salary recommendation. Experiments on five state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that demographic disparities persist under strict visual control and vary substantially across task formulations. These findings underscore the necessity of controlled, counterfactual audits and highlight task design as a critical factor in evaluating social bias in multimodal models.

Motivation: 现实视频问答场景中需跨帧线索提取、迭代检索和多跳推理验证，现有缺乏相关基准。

Method: 构建VideoDR基准，对多模型在两种范式下评估。

Result: Agentic范式不总优于Workflow，其效果依赖模型在长检索链中维持初始视频锚点的能力。

Conclusion: VideoDR为研究开放网络环境下视频智能体提供系统基准，揭示下一代视频深度研究智能体的关键挑战。

Abstract: In real-world video question answering scenarios, videos often provide only localized visual cues, while verifiable answers are distributed across the open web; models therefore need to jointly perform cross-frame clue extraction, iterative retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning-based verification. To bridge this gap, we construct the first video deep research benchmark, VideoDR. VideoDR centers on video-conditioned open-domain video question answering, requiring cross-frame visual anchor extraction, interactive web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over joint video-web evidence; through rigorous human annotation and quality control, we obtain high-quality video deep research samples spanning six semantic domains. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains. Further analysis indicates that goal drift and long-horizon consistency are the core bottlenecks. In sum, VideoDR provides a systematic benchmark for studying video agents in open-web settings and reveals the key challenges for next-generation video deep research agents.

Result: 在SketchJudge上评估显示，先进MLLMs远落后于人类。

Conclusion: 验证了SketchJudge可有效揭示当前视觉 - 语言对齐在符号和嘈杂环境中的脆弱性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual understanding, they often struggle when faced with the unstructured and ambiguous nature of human-generated sketches. This limitation is particularly pronounced in the underexplored task of visual grading, where models should not only solve a problem but also diagnose errors in hand-drawn diagrams. Such diagnostic capabilities depend on complex structural, semantic, and metacognitive reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SketchJudge, a novel benchmark tailored for evaluating MLLMs as graders of hand-drawn STEM diagrams. SketchJudge encompasses 1,015 hand-drawn student responses across four domains: geometry, physics, charts, and flowcharts, featuring diverse stylistic variations and distinct error types. Evaluations on SketchJudge demonstrate that even advanced MLLMs lag significantly behind humans, validating the benchmark's effectiveness in exposing the fragility of current vision-language alignment in symbolic and noisy contexts. All data, code, and evaluation scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/yuhangsu82/SketchJudge.

Motivation: 医学高光谱成像在深度学习中易受对抗攻击，需找出脆弱原因并提出攻击方法以凸显其脆弱性。

Method: 提出针对医学HSI的对抗攻击框架，包括利用相邻像素空间相关性的局部像素依赖攻击和扰动分层光谱 - 空间尺度特征的多尺度信息攻击。

Result: 在Brain和MDC数据集上实验，攻击显著降低分类性能，尤其在肿瘤区域，且视觉上难以察觉。

Conclusion: 所提方法揭示医学HSI模型独特脆弱性，强调临床应用中需具备鲁棒、结构感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Medical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables accurate disease diagnosis by capturing rich spectral-spatial tissue information, but recent advances in deep learning have exposed its vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we identify two fundamental causes of this fragility: the reliance on local pixel dependencies for preserving tissue structure and the dependence on multiscale spectral-spatial representations for hierarchical feature encoding. Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales. Experiments on the Brain and MDC datasets demonstrate that our attacks significantly degrade classification performance, especially in tumor regions, while remaining visually imperceptible. Compared with existing methods, our approach reveals the unique vulnerabilities of medical HSI models and underscores the need for robust, structure-aware defenses in clinical applications.

Motivation: 低剂量PET成像会增加噪声，降低图像质量和诊断可靠性，且现有扩散模型难以在低信噪比等情况下保证解剖结构一致性。

Method: 提出WCC - Net，通过小波表示引入频域结构先验，通过轻量级控制分支将小波结构指导信息注入预训练扩散骨干网络。

Result: WCC - Net在内部1/20剂量测试集上比强扩散基线PSNR提高1.21dB，SSIM提高0.008，减少结构失真和强度误差，且能很好泛化到未见过的剂量水平。

Conclusion: WCC - Net在低剂量PET图像去噪中表现出色，能有效提高图像质量及解剖结构一致性，优于CNN、GAN和扩散模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Low-dose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging reduces patient radiation exposure but suffers from increased noise that degrades image quality and diagnostic reliability. Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines. On the internal 1/20-dose test set, WCC-Net improves PSNR by +1.21 dB and SSIM by +0.008 over a strong diffusion baseline, while reducing structural distortion (GMSD) and intensity error (NMAE). Moreover, WCC-Net generalizes robustly to unseen dose levels (1/50 and 1/4), achieving superior quantitative performance and improved volumetric anatomical consistency.

Result: 在六个医学VQA基准测试中，MedVistaGym - R1 - 8B比同类工具增强模型高出19.10%至24.21%。

Conclusion: 结构化智能体训练能解锁医学图像分析中有效的工具集成推理，而非仅依赖工具访问。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on general image understanding but struggle to think with medical images, especially when performing multi-step reasoning through iterative visual interaction. Medical VLMs often rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, preventing models from re-examining, verifying, or refining visual evidence during reasoning. While tool-integrated reasoning offers a promising path forward, open-source VLMs lack the training infrastructure to learn effective tool selection, invocation, and coordination in multi-modal medical reasoning. We introduce MedVistaGym, a scalable and interactive training environment that incentivizes tool-integrated visual reasoning for medical image analysis. MedVistaGym equips VLMs to determine when and which tools to invoke, localize task-relevant image regions, and integrate single or multiple sub-image evidence into interleaved multimodal reasoning within a unified, executable interface for agentic training. Using MedVistaGym, we train MedVistaGym-R1 to interleave tool use with agentic reasoning through trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Across six medical VQA benchmarks, MedVistaGym-R1-8B exceeds comparably sized tool-augmented baselines by 19.10% to 24.21%, demonstrating that structured agentic training--not tool access alone--unlocks effective tool-integrated reasoning for medical image analysis.

Result: 学习到的模型提高了识别准确率，减轻旧类灾难性遗忘和新类过拟合。

Conclusion: 所提方法在流行基准测试上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally learn models from a small amount of novel data, which requires strong representation and adaptation ability of models learned under few-example supervision to avoid catastrophic forgetting on old classes and overfitting to novel classes. This work proposes a generative co-memory regularization approach to facilitate FSCIL. In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

Motivation: 现有多模态假新闻检测方法依赖静态融合或大语言模型，存在计算冗余和幻觉风险，视觉基础薄弱。

Method: 提出DIVER框架，先通过语言分析建立文本基线，利用模态内一致性过滤不可靠声明，文本证据不足时引入视觉信息，通过模态间对齐验证决定是否深入检查，有显著跨模态语义差异时调用细粒度视觉工具提取证据，通过不确定性感知融合迭代聚合证据。

Result: 在Weibo、Weibo21和GossipCop上实验表明，DIVER平均比现有基线方法高2.72%，推理延迟降低4.12秒。

Conclusion: DIVER框架在多模态假新闻检测中有效且高效，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection is crucial for mitigating adversarial misinformation. Existing methods, relying on static fusion or LLMs, face computational redundancy and hallucination risks due to weak visual foundations. To address this, we propose DIVER (Dynamic Iterative Visual Evidence Reasoning), a framework grounded in a progressive, evidence-driven reasoning paradigm. DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning. Experiments on Weibo, Weibo21, and GossipCop demonstrate that DIVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 2.72\%, while optimizing inference efficiency with a reduced latency of 4.12 s.

Result: 与现有方法相比，实现了更好的反射去除和分离性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效提升单图像反射去除效果。

Abstract: Glass surfaces create complex interactions of reflected and transmitted light, making single-image reflection removal (SIRR) challenging. Existing datasets suffer from limited physical realism in synthetic data or insufficient scale in real captures. We introduce a synthetic dataset generation framework that path-traces 3D glass models over real background imagery to create physically accurate reflection scenarios with varied glass properties, camera settings, and post-processing effects. To leverage the capabilities of Large Multimodal Model (LMM), we concatenate the image layers into a single composite input, apply joint captioning, and fine-tune the model using task-specific LoRA rather than full-parameter training. This enables our approach to achieve improved reflection removal and separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VISA - Mark为保留可靠性的多模态水印建立了新标准。

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases, while some semantic-aware methods incur prohibitive inference latency due to rejection sampling. In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input. These weights guide an adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation mechanism, concentrating watermark strength specifically on visually-supported tokens. By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (96.88% AUC) and robust attack resilience (99.3%) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multimodal watermarking.

Conclusion: PulseMind能较好满足现实临床诊断需求，具有一定优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical multi-modal models focus on specialized image analysis like dermatology, pathology, or radiology. However, they do not fully capture the complexity of real-world clinical diagnostics, which involve heterogeneous inputs and require ongoing contextual understanding during patient-physician interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PulseMind, a new family of multi-modal diagnostic models that integrates a systematically curated dataset, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, and a tailored training framework. Specifically, we first construct a diagnostic dataset, MediScope, which comprises 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images, spanning over 10 major clinical departments and more than 200 sub-specialties. Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO). Compared to absolute score rewards, CRPO uses relative preference signals from multi-dimensional com-parisons to provide stable and human-aligned training guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseMind achieves competitive performance on both the diagnostic consultation benchmark and public medical benchmarks.

Result: 在LLaVA和Qwen - VL模型族的多模态基准测试中，DualPD无需训练即可提升准确率。

Conclusion: DualPD有效且具有可泛化性，代码将在发表时发布。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, their internal reasoning often exhibits a critical inconsistency: although deeper layers may attend to the correct visual regions, final predictions are frequently misled by noisy attention from earlier layers. This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability. The code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 所提DiCo方法有效提升3D血管分割性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new dynamic collaborative network for semi-supervised 3D vessel segmentation, termed DiCo. Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies. Experiments demonstrate that our DiCo method sets new state-of-the-art performance on three 3D vessel segmentation benchmarks. The code repository address is https://github.com/xujiaommcome/DiCo

Abstract: Immersive telepresence aims to transform human interaction in AR/VR applications by enabling lifelike full-body holographic representations for enhanced remote collaboration. However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: 统一的几何基础能有效增强大语言模型的精细运动推理能力。

Abstract: Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.

Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition has advanced with the development of contrastive learning methods. However, most of contrastive paradigms are inherently discriminative and often struggle to capture the variability and uncertainty intrinsic to human motion. To address this issue, we propose a variational contrastive learning framework that integrates probabilistic latent modeling with contrastive self-supervised learning. This formulation enables the learning of structured and semantically meaningful representations that generalize across different datasets and supervision levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in low-label regimes. Moreover, qualitative analyses show that the features provided by our method are more relevant given the motion and sample characteristics, with more focus on important skeleton joints, when compared to the other methods.

Motivation: 现有数据集多关注常见视觉场景，缺乏对模型在非常识场景语义理解能力的测试，需新基准。

Method: 设计半自动化流程，利用大语言模型、少样本提示工程和文本到图像生成合成非常识图像 - 文本样本，用选择题测试模型。

Conclusion: 揭示了视觉语言模型的关键弱点，为开发有真实视觉语义推理能力的鲁棒模型提供诊断工具和研究方向。

Abstract: We propose UAIT (Uncommon-sense Action Image-Text) dataset, a new evaluation benchmark designed to test the semantic understanding ability of visual language models (VLMs) in uncommon-sense action scenes. Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: Transformer自注意力复杂度高，线性注意力应用有问题，提出Multi - Head Linear Attention (MHLA)，在多领域验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力复杂度高限制大规模应用，线性注意力直接应用性能下降，现有修复方法引入额外计算开销，且存在全局上下文崩溃问题。

Method: 提出Multi - Head Linear Attention (MHLA)，沿token维度在划分的头内计算注意力以保留表示多样性。

Result: 在相同时间复杂度下，在ImageNet分类上提升3.6%，NLP上提升6.3%，图像生成上提升12.6%，视频生成上提升41%。

Conclusion: MHLA能保持线性复杂度，恢复softmax注意力的表达能力，在多领域有效。

Abstract: While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.

Abstract: Multilayer (or multiple) networks are widely used to represent diverse patterns of relationships among objects in increasingly complex real-world systems. Identifying a common invariant subspace across network layers has become an active area of research, as such a subspace can filter out layer-specific noise, facilitate cross-network comparisons, reduce dimensionality, and extract shared structural features of scientific interest. One statistical approach to detecting a common subspace is hypothesis testing, which evaluates whether the observed networks share a common latent structure. In this paper, we propose an empirical likelihood (EL) based test for this purpose. The null hypothesis states that all network layers share the same invariant subspace, whereas under the alternative hypothesis at least two layers differ in their subspaces. We study the asymptotic behavior of the proposed test via Monte Carlo approximation and assess its finite-sample performance through extensive simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory size and power, and its practical utility is further illustrated with a real-data application.

Result: 通过大量模拟实验表明，CGHS与惩罚似然方法相比，持续提高了估计精度。

Conclusion: CGHS框架填补了频率学派基于Lasso方法未解决的空白，可有效处理带删失和缺失的高斯数据。

Abstract: Gaussian graphical models provide a powerful framework for studying conditional dependencies in multivariate data, with widespread applications spanning biomedical, environmental sciences, and other data-rich scientific domains. While the Graphical Horseshoe (GHS) method has emerged as a state-of-the-art Bayesian method for sparse precision matrix estimation, existing approaches assume fully observed data and thus fail in the presence of censoring or missingness, which are pervasive in real-world studies. In this paper, we develop the Censored Graphical Horseshoe (CGHS), a novel Bayesian framework that extends the GHS to censored and arbitrarily missing Gaussian data. By introducing a latent-variable representation, CGHS accommodates incomplete observations while retaining the adaptive global-local shrinkage properties of the Horseshoe prior. We derive efficient Gibbs samplers for posterior computation and establish new theoretical results on posterior behavior under censoring and missingness, filling a gap not addressed by frequentist Lasso-based methods. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that CGHS consistently improves estimation accuracy compared to penalized likelihood approaches. Our methods are implemented in the package GHScenmis available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/ghscenmis .

Motivation: 随机森林因局部划分，只能可靠捕捉有边缘效应协变量的交互，需新方法更好利用无边缘效应协变量的交互。

Method: 在UFOs中，优化每棵树前几次划分形成“树根”以捕捉交互，其余部分正常生长；提出基于树根袋外划分准则值的特征重要性指标；引入协变量代表树根。

Result: 仿真研究中，新特征重要性指标能可靠识别无边缘效应的交互协变量；真实数据对比中，UFOs有更高判别和预测精度；代表树根能可靠重现协变量真实效应类型。

Conclusion: UFOs在捕捉无边缘效应协变量交互方面优于随机森林，相关方法有效且可解释。

Abstract: Random forests (RFs) are widely used for prediction and variable importance analysis and are often believed to capture any types of interactions via recursive splitting. However, since the splits are chosen locally, interactions are only reliably captured when at least one involved covariate has a marginal effect. We introduce unity forests (UFOs), an RF variant designed to better exploit interactions involving covariates without marginal effects. In UFOs, the first few splits of each tree are optimized jointly across a random covariate subset to form a "tree root" capturing such interactions; the remainder is grown conventionally. We further propose the unity variable importance measure (VIM), which is based on out-of-bag split criterion values from the tree roots. Here, only a small fraction of tree root splits with the highest in-bag criterion values are considered per covariate, reflecting that covariates with purely interaction-based effects are discriminative only if a split in an interacting covariate occurred earlier in the tree. Finally, we introduce covariate-representative tree roots (CRTRs), which select representative tree roots per covariate and provide interpretable insight into the conditions - marginal or interactive - under which each covariate has its strongest effects. In a simulation study, the unity VIM reliably identified interacting covariates without marginal effects, unlike conventional RF-based VIMs. In a large-scale real-data comparison, UFOs achieved higher discrimination and predictive accuracy than standard RFs, with comparable calibration. The CRTRs reproduced the covariates' true effect types reliably in simulated data and provided interesting insights in a real data analysis.

Abstract: A targeted learning (TL) framework is developed to estimate the difference in the restricted mean survival time (RMST) for a clinical trial with time-to-event outcomes. The approach starts by defining the target estimand as the RMST difference between investigational and control treatments. Next, an efficient estimation method is introduced: a targeted minimum loss estimator (TMLE) utilizing pseudo-observations. Moreover, a version of the copy reference (CR) approach is developed to perform a sensitivity analysis for right-censoring. The proposed TL framework is demonstrated using a real data application.

Abstract: Covariate shift arises when covariate distributions differ between source and target populations while the conditional distribution of the response remains invariant, and it underlies problems in missing data and causal inference. We propose a minimum Wasserstein distance estimation framework for inference under covariate shift that avoids explicit modeling of outcome regressions or importance weights. The resulting W-estimator admits a closed-form expression and is numerically equivalent to the classical 1-nearest neighbor estimator, yielding a new optimal transport interpretation of nearest neighbor methods. We establish root-$n$ asymptotic normality and show that the estimator is not asymptotically linear, leading to super-efficiency relative to the semiparametric efficient estimator under covariate shift in certain regimes, and uniformly in missing data problems. Numerical simulations, along with an analysis of a rainfall dataset, underscore the exceptional performance of our W-estimator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) iteratively fits a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate to accumulated evaluations and selects new queries via an acquisition function such as expected improvement (EI). In practice, BO often concentrates evaluations near the current incumbent, causing the surrogate to become overconfident and to understate predictive uncertainty in the region guiding subsequent decisions. We develop a robust GP-based BO via tempered posterior updates, which downweight the likelihood by a power $α\in (0,1]$ to mitigate overconfidence under local misspecification. We establish cumulative regret bounds for tempered BO under a family of generalized improvement rules, including EI, and show that tempering yields strictly sharper worst-case regret guarantees than the standard posterior $(α=1)$, with the most favorable guarantees occurring near the classical EI choice.
  Motivated by our theoretic findings, we propose a prequential procedure for selecting $α$ online: it decreases $α$ when realized prediction errors exceed model-implied uncertainty and returns $α$ toward one as calibration improves. Empirical results demonstrate that tempering provides a practical yet theoretically grounded tool for stabilizing BO surrogates under localized sampling.

Method: 提出统一IPC运行时套件，集成软硬件内存卸载到共享内存通信，刻画卸载策略与IPC执行的交互，引入多种IPC模式，通过异步流水线、选择性缓存注入和混合协调实现卸载通用化。

Result: 在实际工作负载评估中，指令计数最多减少22%，吞吐量最多提高2.1倍，延迟最多降低72%。

Conclusion: 协调的IPC卸载能在现代数据密集型系统中带来切实的端到端效率提升。

Abstract: As multimodal and AI-driven services exchange hundreds of megabytes per request, existing IPC runtimes spend a growing share of CPU cycles on memory copies. Although both hardware and software mechanisms are exploring memory offloading, current IPC stacks lack a unified runtime model to coordinate them effectively.
  This paper presents a unified IPC runtime suite that integrates both hardware- and software-based memory offloading into shared-memory communication. The system characterizes the interaction between offload strategies and IPC execution, including synchronization, cache visibility, and concurrency, and introduces multiple IPC modes that balance throughput, latency, and CPU efficiency.
  Through asynchronous pipelining, selective cache injection, and hybrid coordination, the system turns offloading from a device-specific feature into a general system capability. Evaluations on real-world workloads show instruction count reductions of up to 22%, throughput improvements of up to 2.1x, and latency reductions of up to 72%, demonstrating that coordinated IPC offloading can deliver tangible end-to-end efficiency gains in modern data-intensive systems.

Conclusion: NanoCockpit框架能有效解决纳米无人机资源利用问题，提升控制性能。

Abstract: Autonomous nano-drones, powered by vision-based tiny machine learning (TinyML) models, are a novel technology gaining momentum thanks to their broad applicability and pushing scientific advancement on resource-limited embedded systems. Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\% to 100\%).

Result: 在三个数据集上评估，70米行程平均漂移率5.9%，平均绝对轨迹误差1.36米，保持校准预测边界。

Abstract: Inertial localization is particularly valuable in GPS-denied environments such as indoors. However, localization using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) suffers from drift caused by motion-process noise and sensor biases. This paper introduces Uncertainty-aware Map-constrained Inertial Localization (UMLoc), an end-to-end framework that jointly models IMU uncertainty and map constraints to achieve drift-resilient positioning. UMLoc integrates two coupled modules: (1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) quantile regressor, which estimates the specific quantiles needed to define 68%, 90%, and 95% prediction intervals serving as a measure of localization uncertainty and (2) a Conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) with cross-attention that fuses IMU dynamic data with distance-based floor-plan maps to generate geometrically feasible trajectories. The modules are trained jointly, allowing uncertainty estimates to propagate through the CGAN during trajectory generation. UMLoc was evaluated on three datasets, including a newly collected 2-hour indoor benchmark with time-aligned IMU data, ground-truth poses and floor-plan maps. Results show that the method achieves a mean drift ratio of 5.9% over a 70 m travel distance and an average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 1.36 m, while maintaining calibrated prediction bounds.

Abstract: Utilizing functional elements in an industrial environment, such as displays and interactive valves, provide effective possibilities for robot training. When preparing simulations for robots or applications that involve high-level scene understanding, the simulation environment must be equally detailed. Although CAD files for such environments deliver an exact description of the geometry and visuals, they usually lack semantic, relational and functional information, thus limiting the simulation and training possibilities. A 3D scene graph can organize semantic, spatial and functional information by enriching the environment through a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). In this paper we present an offline approach to creating detailed 3D scene graphs from CAD environments. This will serve as a foundation to include the relations of functional and actionable elements, which then can be used for dynamic simulation and reasoning. Key results of this research include both quantitative results of the generated semantic labels as well as qualitative results of the scene graph, especially in hindsight of pipe structures and identified functional relations.

Abstract: Post-training algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning can push the limits of robotic models for specific objectives, such as generalizability, accuracy, and robustness. However, Intervention-requiring Failures (IR Failures) (e.g., a robot spilling water or breaking fragile glass) during real-world exploration happen inevitably, hindering the practical deployment of such a paradigm. To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training. Videos and code are available at https://failure-aware-rl.github.io.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses requires a balance between efficient large-scale navigation and high-precision object interaction. Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\% (compared to 62.5\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.

Abstract: Current approaches to humanoid control generally fall into two paradigms: perceptive locomotion, which handles terrain well but is limited to pedal gaits, and general motion tracking, which reproduces complex skills but ignores environmental capabilities. This work unites these paradigms to achieve perceptive general motion control. We present a framework where exteroceptive sensing is integrated into whole-body motion tracking, permitting a humanoid to perform highly dynamic, non-locomotion tasks on uneven terrain. By training a single policy to perform multiple distinct motions across varied terrestrial features, we demonstrate the non-trivial benefit of integrating perception into the control loop. Our results show that this framework enables robust, highly dynamic multi-contact motions, such as vaulting and dive-rolling, on unstructured terrain, significantly expanding the robot's traversability beyond simple walking or running. https://project-instinct.github.io/deep-whole-body-parkour

Abstract: Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.

Conclusion: 直接力学习是模拟驱动量子材料非平衡晶格动力学的高效准确方法。

Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.

TL;DR: 提出物理信息WGAN - GP解决逆Chafee - Infante问题，在数据集上取得稳定反演等结果。


<details>

Motivation: 解决逆Chafee - Infante问题，从近平衡态重构未知初始条件，该逆问题病态且对噪声敏感。

Method: 集成U - Net生成器、带谱归一化的PatchGAN判别器、带梯度惩罚的Wasserstein损失及多个物理信息辅助项，采用显式欧拉离散。

Result: 在数据集上最佳训练模型平均绝对误差约为0.23988159，样本标准差约为0.00266345，实现稳定反演等。

Conclusion: 该方法能实现稳定反演、准确恢复界面结构，对初始数据高频噪声有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present a physics-informed Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for solving the inverse Chafee--Infante problem on two-dimensional domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The objective is to reconstruct an unknown initial condition from a near-equilibrium state obtained after 100 explicit forward Euler iterations of the reaction-diffusion equation \[ u_t - γΔu + κ\left(u^3 - u\right)=0. \] Because this mapping strongly damps high-frequency content, the inverse problem is severely ill-posed and sensitive to noise.
  Our approach integrates a U-Net generator, a PatchGAN critic with spectral normalization, Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty, and several physics-informed auxiliary terms, including Lyapunov energy matching, distributional statistics, and a crucial forward-simulation penalty. This penalty enforces consistency between the predicted initial condition and its forward evolution under the \emph{same} forward Euler discretization used for dataset generation. Earlier experiments employing an Eyre-type semi-implicit solver were not compatible with this residual mechanism due to the cost and instability of Newton iterations within batched GPU training.
  On a dataset of 50k training and 10k testing pairs on $128\times128$ grids (with natural $[-1,1]$ amplitude scaling), the best trained model attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately \textbf{0.23988159} on the full test set, with a sample-wise standard deviation of about \textbf{0.00266345}. The results demonstrate stable inversion, accurate recovery of interfacial structure, and robustness to high-frequency noise in the initial data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单节点GPU架构上基于PDHG的求解器受GPU内存容量和计算吞吐量限制，难以应用于工业规模实例。

Method: 通过对约束矩阵进行二维网格划分将PDHG框架扩展到分布式内存环境，利用NCCL通信后端同步更新，采用块级随机洗牌策略和非零感知数据分布，使用融合CUDA内核加速计算。

Result: 该框架克服单GPU内存瓶颈，利用多GPU并行实现加速，通信开销较低。

Conclusion: 基于cuPDLPx的分布式实现具有强扩展性和高性能，保留完整FP64数值精度。

Abstract: In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm for solving massive-scale linear programming (LP) problems. Although PDHG-based solvers have shown strong performance on single-node GPU architectures, their applicability to industrial-scale instances is often limited by GPU memory capacity and computational throughput. To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead. Extensive experiments on standard LP benchmarks, including MIPLIB and Hans' instances, as well as large-scale real-world datasets, show that our distributed implementation, built upon cuPDLPx, achieves strong scalability and high performance while preserving full FP64 numerical accuracy.

Result: 算法达到了$	ilde O(T^{3/4})$的次线性周期遗憾，为多个同质智能体的无重置学习提供了首个非渐近保证。

Conclusion: 周期性框架能有效解决传统强化学习问题，所提算法有良好效果。

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning usually assumes either episodic interactions with resets or continuous operation to minimize average or cumulative loss. While episodic settings have many theoretical results, resets are often unrealistic in practice. The infinite-horizon setting avoids this issue but lacks non-asymptotic guarantees in online scenarios with unknown dynamics. In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes. To evaluate algorithms in this framework, we introduce the periodic regret, a measure that balances cumulative loss with the terminal law constraint. We then propose the first algorithms for computing periodic policies in two multi-agent settings and show they achieve sublinear periodic regret of order $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. This provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees for reset-free learning in the setting of $M$ homogeneous agents, for $M > 1$.

Motivation: 解决最优函数学习和几何优化中的切比雪夫中心问题这一基本挑战，突破构建稳定最优插值的瓶颈。

Method: 将半无限问题重新表述为有限极大极小优化问题，利用自动微分进行精确数值梯度计算。

Result: 在34个切比雪夫中心问题基准上提高了准确性和效率，扩展到一般凸半无限规划后比现有求解器快达4000倍。

Conclusion: gradOL为切比雪夫中心问题和更广泛的凸半无限规划提供了统一的解决方案框架。

Abstract: We introduce $\textsf{gradOL}$, the first gradient-based optimization framework for solving Chebyshev center problems, a fundamental challenge in optimal function learning and geometric optimization. $\textsf{gradOL}$ hinges on reformulating the semi-infinite problem as a finitary max-min optimization, making it amenable to gradient-based techniques. By leveraging automatic differentiation for precise numerical gradient computation, $\textsf{gradOL}$ ensures numerical stability and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale settings. Under strong convexity of the ambient norm, $\textsf{gradOL}$ provably recovers optimal Chebyshev centers while directly computing the associated radius. This addresses a key bottleneck in constructing stable optimal interpolants. Empirically, $\textsf{gradOL}$ achieves significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency on 34 benchmark Chebyshev center problems from a benchmark $\textsf{CSIP}$ library. Moreover, we extend $\textsf{gradOL}$ to general convex semi-infinite programming (CSIP), attaining up to $4000\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art $\texttt{SIPAMPL}$ solver tested on the indicated $\textsf{CSIP}$ library containing 67 benchmark problems. Furthermore, we provide the first theoretical foundation for applying gradient-based methods to Chebyshev center problems, bridging rigorous analysis with practical algorithms. $\textsf{gradOL}$ thus offers a unified solution framework for Chebyshev centers and broader CSIPs.

Result: 两种方法均优于单块紧凑ILP方法，在能源密集型任务占比适中时，LBBD显著优于CP，可解决多达1600个任务的稀疏实例。

Conclusion: 给出将LBBD方法推广到其他类似问题的途径，并应用于相关问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) with time-of-use energy tariffs (TOU) and machine states, a variant of RCPSP for production scheduling where energy price is part of the criteria and one machine is highly energy-demanding and can be in one of the following three states: proc, idle, or off. The problem involves scheduling all tasks, respecting precedence constraints and resource limitations, while minimizing the combination of the overall makespan and the total energy cost (TEC), which varies according to the TOU pricing, which can take negative values. We propose two novel approaches to solve it: a monolithic Constraint Programming (CP) approach and a Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) approach. The latter combines a master problem dealing with energy cost solved using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) with a subproblem handling the RCPSP resolved using CP. Both approaches surpass the monolithic compact ILP approach, but the LBBD significantly outperforms the CP when the ratio of energy-intensive tasks over the overall tasks is moderate, allowing for solving instances with up to 1600 tasks in sparse instances. Finally, we put forth a way of generalizing our LBBD approach to other problems sharing similar characteristics, and we applied it to a problem based on an RCPSP problem with blocking times & total weighted tardiness criterion and a flexible job shop.

Abstract: This paper studies the AdamW-style Shampoo optimizer, an effective implementation of classical Shampoo that notably won the external tuning track of the AlgoPerf neural network training algorithm competition. Our analysis unifies one-sided and two-sided preconditioning and establishes the convergence rate $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K E\left[\|\nabla f(X_k)\|_*\right]\leq O(\frac{\sqrt{m+n}C}{K^{1/4}})$ measured by nuclear norm, where $K$ represents the iteration number, $(m,n)$ denotes the size of matrix parameters, and $C$ matches the constant in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Theoretically, we have $\|\nabla f(X)\|_F\leq \|\nabla f(X)\|_*\leq \sqrt{m+n}\|\nabla f(X)\|_F$, supporting that our convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the optimal $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(X_k)\|_F\right]\leq O(\frac{C}{K^{1/4}})$ convergence rate of SGD in the ideal case of $\|\nabla f(X)\|_*= Θ(\sqrt{m+n})\|\nabla f(X)\|_F$.

We implement our approach on the basis of a DG(0) Galerkin discretization of the neural ODE, leading to an explicit Euler time marching scheme. For the optimization we use steepest descent. Finally, we apply our method to the construction of neural networks for the classification of data sets, where we present results for a selection of well known examples from the literature.

Result: 与使用默认持续时间计算的计划相比，操作员利用率和完成率提高约20 - 25%。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化和风险感知优化的集成，为现实世界路由应用中处理随机服务持续时间提供了实用框架。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of machine learning forecasts of intervention durations into a stochastic variant of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW). In particular, we exploit tree-based gradient boosting (XGBoost) trained on eight years of gas meter maintenance data to produce point predictions and uncertainty estimates, which then drive a multi-objective evolutionary optimization routine. The methodology addresses uncertainty through sub-Gaussian concentration bounds for route-level risk buffers and explicitly accounts for competing operational KPIs through a multi-objective formulation. Empirical analysis of prediction residuals validates the sub-Gaussian assumption underlying the risk model. From an empirical point of view, our results report improvements around 20-25\% in operator utilization and completion rates compared with plans computed using default durations. The integration of uncertainty quantification and risk-aware optimization provides a practical framework for handling stochastic service durations in real-world routing applications.

Conclusion: CL - QAS有潜力在近期设备上实现自适应、抗噪声的量子学习。

Abstract: We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.

Abstract: In this work, we embed hard constraints in a physics informed neural network (PINN) which predicts solutions to the 2D incompressible Navier Stokes equations. We extend the hard constraint method introduced by Chen et al. (arXiv:2012.06148) from a linear PDE to a strongly non-linear PDE. The PINN is used to estimate the stream function and pressure of the fluid, and by differentiating the stream function we can recover an incompressible velocity field. An unlearnable hard constraint projection (HCP) layer projects the predicted velocity and pressure to a hyperplane that admits only exact solutions to a discretised form of the governing equations.

Motivation: 在零信任架构下内部威胁检测困难，攻击者会用合法凭证模仿用户正常活动，因此需要有效方法加强内部威胁检测。

Method: 利用CERT数据集，用SMOTE技术进行数据清理、归一化和类别平衡，用PCA进行降维；使用SVM、ANN和Bayes Net等模型评估AdaBoost分类器。

Result: AdaBoost的ACC为98.0%、PRE为98.3%、REC为98.0%、F1值表现良好，ROC的AUC为0.98，性能优于SVM、ANN和Bayes Net。

Conclusion: 基于AdaBoost的行为分析在零信任环境中能有效且可靠地加强内部威胁的持续检测。

Abstract: Insider threats are a particularly tricky cybersecurity issue, especially in zero-trust architectures (ZTA) where implicit trust is removed. Although the rule of thumb is never trust, always verify, attackers can still use legitimate credentials and impersonate the standard user activity. In response, behavioral analytics with machine learning (ML) can help monitor the user activity continuously and identify the presence of anomalies. This introductory framework makes use of the CERT Insider Threat Dataset for data cleaning, normalization, and class balance using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). It also employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Several benchmark models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Bayesian Network (Bayes Net), were used to develop and evaluate the AdaBoost classifier. Compared to SVM (90.1%), ANN (94.7%), and Bayes Net (94.9), AdaBoost achieved higher performance with a 98.0% ACC, 98.3% PRE, 98.0% REC, and F1-score (F1). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) study, which provided further confirmation of its strength, yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98. These results prove the effectiveness and dependability of AdaBoost-based behavioral analytics as a solution to reinforcing continuous insider threat detection in zero-trust settings.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving data processing refers to the methods and models that allow computing and analyzing sensitive data with a guarantee of confidentiality. As cloud computing and applications that rely on data continue to expand, there is an increasing need to protect personal, financial and healthcare information. Conventional centralized data processing methods expose sensitive data to risk of breaches, compelling the need to use decentralized and secure data methods. This paper gives a detailed review of privacy-saving mechanisms in the cloud platform, such as statistical approaches like differential privacy and cryptographic solutions like homomorphic encryption. Federated analytics and federated learning, two distributed learning frameworks, are also discussed. Their principles, applications, benefits, and limitations are reviewed, with roles of use in the fields of healthcare, finance, IoT, and industrial cases. Comparative analyses measure trade-offs in security, efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, and investigations are done of emerging hybrid frameworks to provide better privacy protection. Critical issues, including computational overhead, privacy-utility trade-offs, standardization, adversarial threats, and cloud integration are also addressed. This review examines in detail the recent privacy-protecting approaches in cloud computation and offers scholars and practitioners crucial information on secure and effective solutions to data processing.

TL;DR: 文章指出PHP在Web开发中面临安全挑战，提出AutoVulnPHP框架及PHPVD数据集，该框架检测和定位效果好，在实际中发现大量未知漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PHP开发中静态分析语义深度不足、动态分析计算成本高、自动化漏洞定位粒度粗和上下文不精确，以及缺乏大规模PHP漏洞数据集和工具链分散的问题。

Method: 提出AutoVulnPHP框架，结合两阶段漏洞检测和细粒度自动化定位；SIFT - VulMiner生成漏洞假设，SAFE - VulMiner验证候选漏洞，ISAL精确定位根源；贡献PHPVD数据集。

Result: 在公共基准和PHPVD上，AutoVulnPHP检测准确率达99.7%，F1分数99.5%，定位率81.0%；在实际仓库中发现429个未知漏洞，351个获CVE标识符。

Conclusion: AutoVulnPHP框架有效，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: PHP's dominance in web development is undermined by security challenges: static analysis lacks semantic depth, causing high false positives; dynamic analysis is computationally expensive; and automated vulnerability localization suffers from coarse granularity and imprecise context. Additionally, the absence of large-scale PHP vulnerability datasets and fragmented toolchains hinder real-world deployment.
  We present AutoVulnPHP, an end-to-end framework coupling two-stage vulnerability detection with fine-grained automated localization. SIFT-VulMiner (Structural Inference for Flaw Triage Vulnerability Miner) generates vulnerability hypotheses using AST structures enhanced with data flow. SAFE-VulMiner (Semantic Analysis for Flaw Evaluation Vulnerability Miner) verifies candidates through pretrained code encoder embeddings, eliminating false positives. ISAL (Incremental Sequence Analysis for Localization) pinpoints root causes via syntax-guided tracing, chain-of-thought LLM inference, and causal consistency checks to ensure precision.
  We contribute PHPVD, the first large-scale PHP vulnerability dataset with 26,614 files (5.2M LOC) across seven vulnerability types. On public benchmarks and PHPVD, AutoVulnPHP achieves 99.7% detection accuracy, 99.5% F1 score, and 81.0% localization rate. Deployed on real-world repositories, it discovered 429 previously unknown vulnerabilities, 351 assigned CVE identifiers, validating its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 针对网络攻击检测问题，提出 RoBERTa 模型，其效果优于现有 BERT 模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全 BERT 模型对文本数据上下文理解有限，检测网络攻击效果不佳，为解决此问题提出新模型。

Method: 从 PCAP 文件提取数据并用 FHE 加密，用 BBPE 分词器生成令牌，将值应用于 RoBERTa 模型训练，用 Softmax 检测和分类攻击。

Result: RoBERTa 模型在准确率（0.99）、召回率（0.91）和精确率（0.89）方面优于现有 BERT 模型。

Conclusion: RoBERTa 模型在网络攻击检测方面有更好的性能。

Abstract: Background: Cyber-attacks have evolved rapidly in recent years, many individuals and business owners have been affected by cyber-attacks in various ways. Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively.

### [422] [Automated Generation of Accurate Privacy Captions From Android Source Code Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06276)
*Vijayanta Jain,Sepideh Ghanavati,Sai Teja Peddinti,Collin McMillan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出Privacy Caption Generator (PCapGen)生成准确、简洁和完整的隐私说明，评估显示性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成隐私说明的方法存在依赖开发者输入、代码上下文有限、依赖不准确隐私政策等问题，可能误导用户和使开发者面临罚款。

Method: 开发PCapGen，自动识别和提取代码上下文，用大语言模型描述隐私行为并生成说明。

Result: PCapGen生成的说明简洁、完整、准确，隐私专家至少71%选择其说明，大语言模型评判至少76%选择。

Conclusion: PCapGen方法性能表现强，能有效解决现有问题。

Abstract: Privacy captions are short sentences that succinctly describe what personal information is used, how it is used, and why, within an app. These captions can be utilized in various notice formats, such as privacy policies, app rationales, and app store descriptions. However, inaccurate captions may mislead users and expose developers to regulatory fines. Existing approaches to generating privacy notices or just privacy captions include using questionnaires, templates, static analysis, or machine learning. However, these approaches either rely heavily on developers' inputs and thus strain their efforts, use limited source code context, leading to the incomplete capture of app privacy behaviors, or depend on potentially inaccurate privacy policies as a source for creating notices. In this work, we address these limitations by developing Privacy Caption Generator (PCapGen), an approach that - i) automatically identifies and extracts large and precise source code context that implements privacy behaviors in an app, ii) uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to describe coarse- and fine-grained privacy behaviors, and iii) generates accurate, concise, and complete privacy captions to describe the privacy behaviors of the app. Our evaluation shows PCapGen generates concise, complete, and accurate privacy captions as compared to the baseline approach. Furthermore, privacy experts choose PCapGen captions at least 71\% of the time, whereas LLMs-as-judge prefer PCapGen captions at least 76\% of the time, indicating strong performance of our approach.

*Arth Bhardwaj,Nirav Diwan,Gang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文指出大语言模型（LLMs）使网络数据抓取平民化，对LLMs工具在不同安全等级网站上进行基准测试，对比两种工作流程，显示端到端代理让复杂抓取变得容易，并为新手提供使用流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络抓取需专业技术，限制大规模数据提取，而LLMs虽有评估但缺乏对普通用户使用情况的研究，因此研究普通用户用LLMs工具进行网络抓取的能力。

Method: 对35个涵盖五个安全级别的网站进行系统基准测试，设计并评估LLM辅助脚本和端到端LLM代理两种工作流程。

Result: 端到端代理使复杂抓取变得容易，只需少量提示和优化；LLM辅助脚本在静态网站上可能更简单快速。

Conclusion: 为新手提供使用这两种工作流程的简单程序，并评估对手可能利用这些工具达成的目标。

Abstract: Web scraping has historically required technical expertise in HTML parsing, session management, and authentication circumvention, which limited large-scale data extraction to skilled developers. We argue that large language models (LLMs) have democratized web scraping, enabling low-skill users to execute sophisticated operations through simple natural language prompts. While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites. In light of these findings, we provide simple procedures for novices to use these workflows and gauge what adversaries could achieve using these.

Motivation: 现有勒索软件受害者付款后难恢复数据且面临隐私风险，不确定性影响攻防决策。

Method: 引入零知识证明实现可验证数据恢复，用智能合约执行多轮支付，降低数据泄露和隐私损失风险。

Result: zkRansomware 用现有工具技术可行，能使攻击者和受害者激励对齐。

Conclusion: 开发 zkRansomware 理论决策框架，与已知模型有区别，对风险分析和响应决策有意义。

Abstract: Ransomware is still one of the most serious cybersecurity threats. Victims often pay but fail to regain access to their data, while also facing the danger of losing data privacy. These uncertainties heavily shape the attacker-victim dynamics in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce and analyze zkRansomware. This new ransomware model integrates zero-knowledge proofs to enable verifiable data recovery and uses smart contracts to enforce multi-round payments while mitigating the risk of data disclosure and privacy loss. We show that zkRansomware is technically feasible using existing cryptographic and blockchain tools and, perhaps counterintuitively, can align incentives between the attacker and the victim. Finally, we develop a theoretical decision-making frame- work for zkRansomware that distinguishes it from known ransomware decision models and discusses its implications for ransomware risk anal- ysis and response decision support.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 介绍用于检测恶意软件包的CHASE架构，评估显示其召回率高、误报率低，适用于自动化筛查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件包注册表易被攻击，LLM应用于恶意软件检测有幻觉和上下文混淆等挑战，需高可靠性检测方案。

Method: 提出CHASE多智能体架构，通过计划 - 执行协调模型、专注特定分析的工作代理和集成确定性安全工具来应对LLM局限。

Result: 在3000个软件包数据集上，CHASE召回率达98.4%，误报率仅0.08%，每个包平均分析时间4.5分钟，还对安全专业人员做了调查。

Conclusion: 为构建可适应现代软件供应链复杂性的可靠AI安全工具提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Modern software package registries like PyPI have become critical infrastructure for software development, but are increasingly exploited by threat actors distributing malicious packages with sophisticated multi-stage attack chains. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automated code analysis, their application to security-critical malware detection faces fundamental challenges, including hallucination and context confusion, which can lead to missed detections or false alarms. We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations. Our key insight is that reliability in LLM-based security analysis emerges not from improving individual model capabilities but from architecting systems that compensate for LLM weaknesses while leveraging their semantic understanding strengths. Evaluation on a dataset of 3,000 packages (500 malicious, 2,500 benign) demonstrates that CHASE achieves 98.4% recall with only 0.08% false positive rate, while maintaining a practical median analysis time of 4.5 minutes per package, making it suitable for operational deployment in automated package screening. Furthermore, we conducted a survey with cybersecurity professionals to evaluate the generated analysis reports, identifying their key strengths and areas for improvement. This work provides a blueprint for building reliable AI-powered security tools that can scale with the growing complexity of modern software supply chains.

TL;DR: 引入框架Zer0n将大语言模型推理能力与区块链技术结合，解决安全自动化‘信任鸿沟’，评估显示其效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漏洞研究使用生成式AI产生的模型输出不透明，造成安全自动化‘信任鸿沟’。

Method: 引入Zer0n框架，结合Gemini 2.0 Pro进行漏洞检测，用Avalanche C - Chain记录工件，采用混合架构，执行在链外，完整性证明在链上。

Result: 在500个端点数据集上，检测准确率达80%，仅有22.9%的少量开销。

Conclusion: 实现了分布式完整性与高速安全工作流的共存。

Abstract: As vulnerability research increasingly adopts generative AI, a critical reliance on opaque model outputs has emerged, creating a "trust gap" in security automation. We address this by introducing Zer0n, a framework that anchors the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the immutable audit trails of blockchain technology. Specifically, we integrate Gemini 2.0 Pro for logic-based vulnerability detection with the Avalanche C-Chain for tamper-evident artifact logging. Unlike fully decentralized solutions that suffer from high latency, Zer0n employs a hybrid architecture: execution remains off-chain for performance, while integrity proofs are finalized on-chain. Our evaluation on a dataset of 500 endpoints reveals that this approach achieves 80% detection accuracy with only a marginal 22.9% overhead, effectively demonstrating that decentralized integrity can coexist with high-speed security workflows.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 对先进的安全代码生成方法进行对抗性审计，揭示了其鲁棒性的关键差距，并提出最佳实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全代码生成方法在对抗性条件下的鲁棒性未经过测试，且当前评估将安全性与功能性分离，可能夸大收益。

Method: 对SVEN、SafeCoder、PromSec进行系统性对抗性审计，采用现实的提示扰动，在一致条件下联合评估安全性和功能性。

Result: 静态分析工具高估安全性7到21倍，37%到60%的“安全”输出无功能。在对抗性条件下，真正安全且有功能的比率降至3%到17%。

Conclusion: 提出构建和评估稳健安全代码生成方法的最佳实践。

Abstract: Recent secure code generation methods, using vulnerability-aware fine-tuning, prefix-tuning, and prompt optimization, claim to prevent LLMs from producing insecure code. However, their robustness under adversarial conditions remains untested, and current evaluations decouple security from functionality, potentially inflating reported gains. We present the first systematic adversarial audit of state-of-the-art secure code generation methods (SVEN, SafeCoder, PromSec). We subject them to realistic prompt perturbations such as paraphrasing, cue inversion, and context manipulation that developers might inadvertently introduce or adversaries deliberately exploit. To enable fair comparison, we evaluate all methods under consistent conditions, jointly assessing security and functionality using multiple analyzers and executable tests. Our findings reveal critical robustness gaps: static analyzers overestimate security by 7 to 21 times, with 37 to 60% of ``secure'' outputs being non-functional. Under adversarial conditions, true secure-and-functional rates collapse to 3 to 17%. Based on these findings, we propose best practices for building and evaluating robust secure code generation methods. Our code is available.

TL;DR: 本文利用成员推理攻击（MIA）对遥感图像分类的联邦学习进行隐私评估，实验表明MIA能有效揭示隐私泄漏，通信高效策略可降低MIA成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽能保护数据隐私，但模型输出可能仍会泄漏敏感信息，需严格的隐私评估。

Method: 使用成员推理攻击（MIA）作为定量隐私测量框架，评估多种黑盒MIA技术，涵盖不同联邦学习算法和通信策略。

Result: 在两个公开场景分类数据集上实验，MIA能揭示仅靠准确率无法体现的隐私泄漏，通信高效的联邦学习策略降低MIA成功率并保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 确认MIA是实用指标，强调遥感应用中联邦学习系统设计需融入隐私测量。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while keeping training data localized, allowing us to preserve privacy in various domains including remote sensing. However, recent studies show that FL models may still leak sensitive information through their outputs, motivating the need for rigorous privacy evaluation. In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance. These findings confirm MIA as a practical metric and highlight the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications.

Result: 使用基准数据集EMBER和CIC - MalMem2022进行实验评估，该方法准确率达97.3%，误报率仅1.5%，检测延迟极小，优于现有机器学习和深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 混合AI能检测现有和新型恶意软件变体，为能实时检测并适应快速演变威胁环境的智能安全系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise in frequency and complexity of malware attacks are viewed as a major threat to modern digital infrastructure, which means that traditional signature-based detection methods are becoming less effective. As cyber threats continue to evolve, there is a growing need for intelligent systems to accurately and proactively identify and prevent malware infections. This study presents a new hybrid context-aware malware detection framework(HCAMDF) based on artificial intelligence (AI), which combines static file analysis, dynamic behavioural analysis, and contextual metadata to provide more accurate and timely detection. HCADMF has a multi-layer architecture, which consists of lightweight static classifiers such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for real-time behavioral analysis, and an ensemble risk scoring through the integration of multiple layers of prediction. Experimental evaluations of the new/methodology with benchmark datasets, EMBER and CIC-MalMem2022, showed that the new approach provides superior performances with an accuracy of 97.3%, only a 1.5% false positive rate and minimal detection delay compared to several existing machine learning(ML) and deep learning(DL) established methods in the same fields. The results show strong evidence that hybrid AI can detect both existing and novel malware variants, and lay the foundation on intelligent security systems that can enable real-time detection and adapt to a rapidly evolving threat landscape.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI systems creates unprecedented opportunities for content creation while raising critical concerns about controllability, copyright infringement, and content provenance. Current generative models operate as "black boxes" with limited user control and lack built-in mechanisms to protect intellectual property or trace content origin. We propose a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through specialized agent roles and integrated watermarking. Our system orchestrates Director, Generator, Reviewer, Integration, and Protection agents to ensure user intent alignment while embedding digital provenance markers. We demonstrate feasibility through two case studies: creative content generation with iterative refinement and copyright protection for AI-generated art in commercial contexts. Preliminary feasibility evidence from prior work indicates up to 23\% improvement in semantic alignment and 95\% watermark recovery rates. This work contributes to responsible generative AI deployment, positioning multi-agent systems as a solution for trustworthy creative workflows in legal and commercial applications.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of synthetic media, presentation attacks, and document forgeries has created significant vulnerabilities in Know Your Customer (KYC) workflows across financial services, telecommunications, and digital-identity ecosystems. Traditional monolithic KYC systems lack the scalability and agility required to counter adaptive fraud. This paper proposes an Agentic AI Microservice Framework that integrates modular vision models, liveness assessment, deepfake detection, OCR-based document forensics, multimodal identity linking, and a policy driven risk engine. The system leverages autonomous micro-agents for task decomposition, pipeline orchestration, dynamic retries, and human-in-the-loop escalation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate improved detection accuracy, reduced latency, and enhanced resilience against adversarial inputs. The framework offers a scalable blueprint for regulated industries seeking robust, real-time, and privacy-preserving KYC verification.

Method: 提出管辖区感知、隐私设计架构，动态集成本地化加密、自适应差分隐私和基于密码学证明的实时合规声明。

Result: 在多管辖区模拟中，该架构将未授权数据暴露降至5%以下，实现零合规违规，同时模型效用保留率超90%且计算开销可控。

Conclusion: 主动、集成的控制措施可实现安全且全球合规的人工智能部署。

Abstract: The reliance of Large Language Models and Internet of Things systems on massive, globally distributed data flows creates systemic security and privacy challenges. When data traverses borders, it becomes subject to conflicting legal regimes, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law, compounded by technical vulnerabilities like model memorization. Current static encryption and data localization methods are fragmented and reactive, failing to provide adequate, policy-aligned safeguards. This research proposes a Jurisdiction-Aware, Privacy-by-Design architecture that dynamically integrates localized encryption, adaptive differential privacy, and real-time compliance assertion via cryptographic proofs. Empirical validation in a multi-jurisdictional simulation demonstrates this architecture reduced unauthorized data exposure to below five percent and achieved zero compliance violations. These security gains were realized while maintaining model utility retention above ninety percent and limiting computational overhead. This establishes that proactive, integrated controls are feasible for secure and globally compliant AI deployment.

Abstract: Most users agree to online privacy policies without reading or understanding them, even though these documents govern how personal data is collected, shared, and monetized. Privacy policies are typically long, legally complex, and difficult for non-experts to interpret. This paper presents the Smart Privacy Policy Assistant, an LLM-powered system that automatically ingests privacy policies, extracts and categorizes key clauses, assigns human-interpretable risk levels, and generates clear, concise explanations. The system is designed for real-time use through browser extensions or mobile interfaces, surfacing contextual warnings before users disclose sensitive information or grant risky permissions. We describe the end-to-end pipeline, including policy ingestion, clause categorization, risk scoring, and explanation generation, and propose an evaluation framework based on clause-level accuracy, policy-level risk agreement, and user comprehension.

Motivation: 新式花式二维码成为新的攻击向量，可躲避现有反制措施，需要新方案应对二维码钓鱼攻击。

Method: ALFA方法：先将花式二维码转换为二进制网格副本，识别网格中错误模块；用FAST方法恢复错误模块；提取结构特征并用预训练模型预测合法性。

Result: 在合成数据集上实验FNR仅0.06%；开发移动应用测试可行性，与真实世界二维码阅读器对比，凸显分类可靠性和检测准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的ALFA方法能有效减轻二维码钓鱼攻击，在实际环境中具有较高的分类可靠性和检测准确性。

Abstract: Phishing with Quick Response (QR) codes is termed as Quishing. The attackers exploit this method to manipulate individuals into revealing their confidential data. Recently, we see the colorful and fancy representations of QR codes, the 2D matrix of QR codes which does not reflect a typical mixture of black-white modules anymore. Instead, they become more tempting as an attack vector for adversaries which can evade the state-of-the-art deep learning visual-based and other prevailing countermeasures. We introduce "ALFA", a safe-by-design approach, to mitigate Quishing and prevent everyone from accessing the post-scan harmful payload of fancy QR codes. Our method first converts a fancy QR code into the replica of binary grid and then identify the erroneous representation of modules in that grid. Following that, we present "FAST" method which can conveniently recover erroneous modules from that binary grid. Afterwards, using this binary grid, our solution extracts the structural features of fancy QR code and predicts its legitimacy using a pre-trained model. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset (containing diverse variations of fancy QR codes) and achieve a FNR of 0.06% only. We also develop the mobile app to test the practical feasibility of our solution and provide a performance comparison of the app with the real-world QR readers. This comparison further highlights the classification reliability and detection accuracy of this solution in real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 随着多媒体消费增长，WebRTC 协议的应用广泛，但网络条件会影响 QoE。ISP 因加密难以估计 QoE，提出 qAttCNN 模型，在自定义数据集评估效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频会议和即时通讯应用依赖 WebRTC 协议，网络条件影响 QoE，且 ISP 因端到端加密难以估计 QoE，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出 QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN) 模型，利用流量的数据包大小参数推断两个无参考 QoE 指标（BRISQUE 和 FPS）。

Result: 在 WhatsApp 视频通话自定义数据集上评估 qAttCNN 并与现有 QoE 模型对比，MAEP 显示 BRISQUE 误差 2.14%，FPS 预测误差 7.39%。

Conclusion: 所提出的 qAttCNN 模型在通过数据包大小参数推断 QoE 指标上表现良好，能为 ISP 估计 QoE 提供有效方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型经偏好对齐训练后，是否易受旨在利用模型取悦用户偏好而牺牲真实性的偏好破坏攻击。

Method: 提出一种诊断方法，采用因子评估框架，在2×2^4设计中，将提示引起的变化分解为系统目标和偏好破坏攻击式对话因素的可解释效应。

Result: 更先进的模型有时更易受操纵提示影响，除现实否认因素外，还存在模型特定的符号反转和与偏好破坏攻击式因素的交互。

Conclusion: 所提出的因子评估方法可对大语言模型的训练后过程进行更细致诊断，有助于在产品迭代中更好权衡偏好对齐风险和操纵提示的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) training often optimizes for preference alignment, rewarding outputs that are perceived as helpful and interaction-friendly. However, this preference-oriented objective can be exploited: manipulative prompts can steer responses toward user-appeasing agreement and away from truth-oriented correction. In this work, we investigate whether aligned models are vulnerable to Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA), a class of manipulative prompting strategies designed to exploit the model's desire to please user preferences at the expense of truthfulness. We propose a diagnostic methodology that provides a finer-grained and more directive analysis than aggregate benchmark scores, using a factorial evaluation framework to decompose prompt-induced shifts into interpretable effects of system objectives (truth- vs. preference-oriented) and PUA-style dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial) within a controlled $2 \times 2^4$ design. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulative prompts. Beyond the dominant reality-denial factor, we observe model-specific sign reversals and interactions with PUA-style factors, suggesting tailored defenses rather than uniform robustness. These findings offer a novel, reproducible factorial evaluation methodology that provides finer-grained diagnostics for post-training processes like RLHF, enabling better trade-offs in the product iteration of LLMs by offering a more nuanced understanding of preference alignment risks and the impact of manipulative prompts.

Conclusion: 这是首个有HITL支持的健壮LLM - RL云防御框架，将开源推动云网络防御发展。

Abstract: While virtualization and resource pooling empower cloud networks with structural flexibility and elastic scalability, they inevitably expand the attack surface and challenge cyber resilience. Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining. To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a robust LLM-RL framework with HITL support for cloud defense. We will release our framework to the community, facilitating the advancement of robust and autonomous defense in cloud networks.

Result: 实现更强大网络，显著降低计算复杂度，在边缘仅训练下游分类器保持高精度。

Conclusion: PoR可扩展到大型物联网网络，低延迟、低存储增长，能适应数据、法规和网络条件变化。

Abstract: Consensus mechanisms are the core of any blockchain system. However, the majority of these mechanisms do not target federated learning directly nor do they aid in the aggregation step. This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions.

TL;DR: 提出SMTA和BAU机制防止企业LLM环境数据泄露，经实验验证效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机构各部门采用LLM时，数据泄露风险成为关键安全和合规问题。

Method: 提出SMTA隔离各部门LLM实例，引入BAU机制确保对话上下文使用后自动销毁；通过两组共127次测试迭代评估。

Result: SMTA防御成功率92%，BAU缓解会话后泄漏威胁成功率76.75%。

Conclusion: SMTA和BAU共同为企业LLM实现严格隔离、会话短暂性、强保密性等。

Abstract: This study presents a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture (SMTA) combined with a novel concept Burn-After-Use (BAU) mechanism for enterprise LLM environments to effectively prevent data leakage. As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs.

Motivation: 现有AIGC图像水印方法易受攻击且无法支持语义级篡改定位，需新方法保护版权。

Result: 在12种攻击方法实验中，验证准确率达98.43%，平均比SOTA方法高37.25%，高级AIGC编辑下仍有强篡改定位性能。

Conclusion: PAI框架有效，能为AIGC版权保护提供强大支持。

Abstract: Protecting the copyright of user-generated AI images is an emerging challenge as AIGC becomes pervasive in creative workflows. Existing watermarking methods (1) remain vulnerable to real-world adversarial threats, often forced to trade off between defenses against spoofing and removal attacks; and (2) cannot support semantic-level tamper localization. We introduce PAI, a training-free inherent watermarking framework for AIGC copyright protection, plug-and-play with diffusion-based AIGC services. PAI simultaneously provides three key functionalities: robust ownership verification, attack detection, and semantic-level tampering localization. Unlike existing inherent watermark methods that only embed watermarks at noise initialization of diffusion models, we design a novel key-conditioned deflection mechanism that subtly steers the denoising trajectory according to the user key. Such trajectory-level coupling further strengthens the semantic entanglement of identity and content, thereby further enhancing robustness against real-world threats. Moreover, we also provide a theoretical analysis proving that only the valid key can pass verification. Experiments across 12 attack methods show that PAI achieves 98.43\% verification accuracy, improving over SOTA methods by 37.25\% on average, and retains strong tampering localization performance even against advanced AIGC edits.

Abstract: Fraudulent activities on digital banking services are becoming more intricate by the day, challenging existing defenses. While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 91 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms.

Method: 提出SecMoE框架，采用Select - Then - Compute方法，统一MoE层和分段多项式函数中的逐条目电路。

Result: 使模型用于隐私推理时规模扩大63倍，端到端运行时间仅增加15.2倍；在5个专家设置下，降低端到端私有推理通信量1.8 - 7.1倍，比现有协议提速1.3 - 3.8倍。

Conclusion: SecMoE框架有效解决了MoE架构下隐私保护推理的隐私和效率问题。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving Transformer inference has gained attention due to the potential leakage of private information. Despite recent progress, existing frameworks still fall short of practical model scales, with gaps up to a hundredfold. A possible way to close this gap is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has emerged as a promising technique to scale up model capacity with minimal overhead. However, given that the current secure two-party (2-PC) protocols allow the server to homomorphically compute the FFN layer with its plaintext model weight, under the MoE setting, this could reveal which expert is activated to the server, exposing token-level privacy about the client's input. While naively evaluating all the experts before selection could protect privacy, it nullifies MoE sparsity and incurs the heavy computational overhead that sparse MoE seeks to avoid. To address the privacy and efficiency limitations above, we propose a 2-PC privacy-preserving inference framework, \SecMoE. Unifying per-entry circuits in both the MoE layer and piecewise polynomial functions, \SecMoE obliviously selects the extracted parameters from circuits and only computes one encrypted entry, which we refer to as Select-Then-Compute. This makes the model for private inference scale to 63$\times$ larger while only having a 15.2$\times$ increase in end-to-end runtime. Extensive experiments show that, under 5 expert settings, \SecMoE lowers the end-to-end private inference communication by 1.8$\sim$7.1$\times$ and achieves 1.3$\sim$3.8$\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) protocols.

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效提升大语言模型在智能合约重入漏洞检测的性能，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Despite being trained on large-scale, high-quality data, LLMs still fail to outperform traditional static analysis tools in specialized domains like smart contract vulnerability detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training algorithm based on atomic task decomposition and fusion. This algorithm aims to achieve combinatorial generalization under limited data by decomposing complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, we decompose the reentrancy vulnerability detection task into four linearly independent atomic tasks: identifying external calls, identifying state updates, identifying data dependencies between external calls and state updates, and determining their data flow order. These tasks form the core components of our approach. By training on synthetic datasets, we generate three compiler-verified datasets. We then employ the Slither tool to extract structural information from the control flow graph and data flow graph, which is used to fine-tune the LLM's adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that low-rank normalization fusion with the LoRA adapter improves the LLM's reentrancy vulnerability detection accuracy to 98.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. On 31 real-world contracts, the algorithm achieves a 20% higher recall than traditional analysis tools.

Conclusion: AI 内存是 AI 基础设施，MemTrust 是通用可信框架，有望成为内存基础设施的基础。

Abstract: AI memory systems are evolving toward unified context layers that enable efficient cross-agent collaboration and multi-tool workflows, facilitating better accumulation of personal data and learning of user preferences. However, centralization creates a trust crisis where users must entrust cloud providers with sensitive digital memory data. We identify a core tension between personalization demands and data sovereignty: centralized memory systems enable efficient cross-agent collaboration but expose users' sensitive data to cloud provider risks, while private deployments provide security but limit collaboration. To resolve this tension, we aim to achieve local-equivalent security while enabling superior maintenance efficiency and collaborative capabilities. We propose a five-layer architecture abstracting common functional components of AI memory systems: Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, and Governance. By applying TEE protection to each layer, we establish a trustworthy framework. Based on this, we design MemTrust, a hardware-backed zero-trust architecture that provides cryptographic guarantees across all layers. Our contributions include the five-layer abstraction, "Context from MemTrust" protocol for cross-application sharing, side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns, and comprehensive security analysis. The architecture enables third-party developers to port existing systems with acceptable development costs, achieving system-wide trustworthiness. We believe that AI memory plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and collaboration of agents and AI tools. AI memory will become the foundational infrastructure for AI agents, and MemTrust serves as a universal trusted framework for AI memory systems, with the goal of becoming the infrastructure of memory infrastructure.

Motivation: 先前研究未解决确保恶意内容被实际检索的难题，因此不清楚IPI的实际影响。

Method: 将恶意内容分解为保证检索的触发片段和编码攻击目标的攻击片段，设计高效黑盒攻击算法来构造触发片段。

Result: 攻击在11个基准和8个嵌入模型上实现近100%检索，通过自然查询和真实外部语料实现端到端IPI攻击，能让GPT - 4o在多智能体工作流中以超80%成功率泄露SSH密钥。

Conclusion: IPI是实际且严重的威胁，现有防御不足以防止恶意文本检索，检索是关键开放漏洞。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on retrieving information from external corpora. This creates a new attack surface: indirect prompt injection (IPI), where hidden instructions are planted in the corpora and hijack model behavior once retrieved. Previous studies have highlighted this risk but often avoid the hardest step: ensuring that malicious content is actually retrieved. In practice, unoptimized IPI is rarely retrieved under natural queries, which leaves its real-world impact unclear.
  We address this challenge by decomposing the malicious content into a trigger fragment that guarantees retrieval and an attack fragment that encodes arbitrary attack objectives. Based on this idea, we design an efficient and effective black-box attack algorithm that constructs a compact trigger fragment to guarantee retrieval for any attack fragment. Our attack requires only API access to embedding models, is cost-efficient (as little as $0.21 per target user query on OpenAI's embedding models), and achieves near-100% retrieval across 11 benchmarks and 8 embedding models (including both open-source models and proprietary services).
  Based on this attack, we present the first end-to-end IPI exploits under natural queries and realistic external corpora, spanning both RAG and agentic systems with diverse attack objectives. These results establish IPI as a practical and severe threat: when a user issued a natural query to summarize emails on frequently asked topics, a single poisoned email was sufficient to coerce GPT-4o into exfiltrating SSH keys with over 80% success in a multi-agent workflow. We further evaluate several defenses and find that they are insufficient to prevent the retrieval of malicious text, highlighting retrieval as a critical open vulnerability.

Conclusion: Safe - FedLLM是一个有效的联邦大语言模型防御框架，代码开源。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy and silo issues in large language models (LLMs). Most prior work focuses on improving the training efficiency of federated LLMs. However, security in open environments is overlooked, particularly defenses against malicious clients. To investigate the safety of LLMs during FL, we conduct preliminary experiments to analyze potential attack surfaces and defensible characteristics from the perspective of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. We find two key properties of FL: 1) LLMs are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients in FL, and 2) LoRA weights exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that can be filtered through simple classifiers. Based on these properties, we propose Safe-FedLLM, a probe-based defense framework for federated LLMs, constructing defenses across three dimensions: Step-Level, Client-Level, and Shadow-Level. The core concept of Safe-FedLLM is to perform probe-based discrimination on the LoRA weights locally trained by each client during FL, treating them as high-dimensional behavioral features and using lightweight classification models to determine whether they possess malicious attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-FedLLM effectively enhances the defense capability of federated LLMs without compromising performance on benign data. Notably, our method effectively suppresses malicious data impact without significant impact on training speed, and remains effective even with many malicious clients.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications, where they must follow system- or developer-specified instructions that define the intended task behavior, while completing benign user requests. When adversarial instructions appear in user queries or externally retrieved content, models may override intended logic. Recent defenses rely on supervised fine-tuning with benign and malicious labels. Although these methods achieve high attack rejection rates, we find that they rely on narrow correlations in defense data rather than harmful intent, leading to systematic rejection of safe inputs. We analyze three recurring shortcut behaviors induced by defense fine-tuning. \emph{Position bias} arises when benign content placed later in a prompt is rejected at much higher rates; across reasoning benchmarks, suffix-task rejection rises from below \textbf{10\%} to as high as \textbf{90\%}. \emph{Token trigger bias} occurs when strings common in attack data raise rejection probability even in benign contexts; inserting a single trigger token increases false refusals by up to \textbf{50\%}. \emph{Topic generalization bias} reflects poor generalization beyond the defense data distribution, with defended models suffering test-time accuracy drops of up to \textbf{40\%}. These findings suggest that current prompt-injection defenses frequently respond to attack-like surface patterns rather than the underlying intent. We introduce controlled diagnostic datasets and a systematic evaluation across two base models and multiple defense pipelines, highlighting limitations of supervised fine-tuning for reliable LLM security.

Motivation: 多数无学习方法需请求者先上传数据，在许多隐私保护场景不可行，因此探索在不向服务器暴露擦除数据的条件下实现无学习。

Method: 提出BlindU，使用压缩表示而非原始输入进行无学习；采用信息瓶颈机制用于联邦学习模型训练；集成两个专为基于信息瓶颈的模型定制的无学习模块；使用多梯度下降算法平衡遗忘和效用保留；引入噪声自由差分隐私掩码方法处理原始擦除数据。

Conclusion: BlindU在不向服务器暴露擦除数据的情况下，能有效实现无学习，且在隐私保护和无学习效果上表现出色。

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables data holders to remove the contribution of their specified samples from trained models to protect their privacy. However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文对针对网络自动化代理的社会工程攻击进行系统研究，提出攻击范式AgentBait和防御模块SUPERVISOR，实证表明现有框架易受攻击，该模块能有效降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型威胁，网络自动化代理的社会工程风险研究不足。

Method: 攻击上提出AgentBait范式利用代理执行弱点引导其执行恶意操作；防御上提出SUPERVISOR模块在执行前确保网页环境和目标一致性。

Result: 主流框架对AgentBait高度脆弱，平均攻击成功率67.5%；SUPERVISOR模块能平均降低78.1%攻击成功率，运行开销仅7.7%。

Conclusion: AgentBait是网络代理的新关键威胁面，SUPERVISOR是实用且可推广的防御方案，提升了该领域安全性。

Abstract: Web agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), are increasingly deployed to automate complex web interactions. The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.
  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem. We reported the details of this attack to the framework developers and received acknowledgment before submission.

TL;DR: 提出用于MCP生态系统中隐式工具中毒的自动化自适应框架MCP - ITP，实验显示其性能优于手工基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP协议下，集成外部工具使代理易受工具中毒攻击，此前工作多关注显式或手工制作的中毒工具，本文聚焦隐式工具中毒。

Method: 将中毒工具生成表述为黑盒优化问题，采用迭代优化策略，利用评估大语言模型和检测大语言模型的反馈。

Result: 在MCPTox数据集的12个大语言模型代理上实验，MCP - ITP始终优于手工基线，攻击成功率达84.2%，恶意工具检测率低至0.3%。

Conclusion: MCP - ITP是应对MCP生态系统中隐式工具中毒的有效框架。

Abstract: To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) was proposed and has since been widely adopted. However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共识协议对区块链系统至关重要，需正确设计和实现，但形式验证难度大且常被省略，因此需要工具辅助。

Method: 开发工具IsabeLLM，将证明助手Isabelle与大语言模型集成，使用DeepSeek R1 API进行演示。

Result: 生成了比特币工作量证明共识协议的新模型，并验证其正确性，能为验证中的非平凡引理生成正确证明。

Conclusion: IsabeLLM工具在验证共识协议正确性方面是有效的。

Abstract: Consensus protocols are crucial for a blockchain system as they are what allow agreement between the system's nodes in a potentially adversarial environment. For this reason, it is paramount to ensure their correct design and implementation to prevent such adversaries from carrying out malicious behaviour. Formal verification allows us to ensure the correctness of such protocols, but requires high levels of effort and expertise to carry out and thus is often omitted in the development process. In this paper, we present IsabeLLM, a tool that integrates the proof assistant Isabelle with a Large Language Model to assist and automate proofs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IsabeLLM by using it to develop a novel model of Bitcoin's Proof of Work consensus protocol and verify its correctness. We use the DeepSeek R1 API for this demonstration and found that we were able to generate correct proofs for each of the non-trivial lemmas present in the verification.

Motivation: 6G网络加速多智能体系统自主性和智能性，但系统易受压力因素影响，现有文献缺乏对多智能体弹性的统一原则性定义，限制设计能在动态条件下持续感知、适应和恢复的系统的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为下一代通信系统中弹性分散式MAS奠定基础。

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks is accelerating autonomy and intelligence in large-scale, decentralized multi-agent systems (MAS). While this evolution enables adaptive behavior, it also heightens vulnerability to stressors such as environmental changes and adversarial behavior. Existing literature on resilience in decentralized MAS largely focuses on isolated aspects, such as fault tolerance, without offering a principled unified definition of multi-agent resilience. This gap limits the ability to design systems that can continuously sense, adapt, and recover under dynamic conditions. This article proposes a formal definition of MAS resilience grounded in two complementary dimensions: epistemic resilience, wherein agents recover and sustain accurate knowledge of the environment, and action resilience, wherein agents leverage that knowledge to coordinate and sustain goals under disruptions. We formalize resilience via temporal epistemic logic and quantify it using recoverability time (how quickly desired properties are re-established after a disturbance) and durability time (how long accurate beliefs and goal-directed behavior are sustained after recovery). We design an agent architecture and develop decentralized algorithms to achieve both epistemic and action resilience. We provide formal verification guarantees, showing that our specifications are sound with respect to the metric bounds and admit finite-horizon verification, enabling design-time certification and lightweight runtime monitoring. Through a case study on distributed multi-agent decision-making under stressors, we show that our approach outperforms baseline methods. Our formal verification analysis and simulation results highlight that the proposed framework enables resilient, knowledge-driven decision-making and sustained operation, laying the groundwork for resilient decentralized MAS in next-generation communication systems.

Motivation: 基于随机游走的算法虽在分布式系统受欢迎，但因依赖本地交互易受恶意行为影响，特别是“吃豆人”攻击，促使研究应对方法。

Method: 提出完全去中心化、有弹性的CREATE - IF - LATE（CIL）算法，实现自创建随机游走并防止其灭绝。

Result: 理论分析表明CIL算法有非灭绝、有界性、收敛性等特性；实验在合成和公开基准数据集上验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: CIL算法能有效应对“吃豆人”攻击，学习过程最多有线性时间延迟。

Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the CREATE-IF-LATE (CIL) algorithm, which is a fully decentralized, resilient mechanism that enables self-creating RWs and prevents RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis shows that the CIL algorithm guarantees several desirable properties, such as (i) non-extinction of the RW population, (ii) almost sure boundedness of the RW population, and (iii) convergence of RW-based stochastic gradient descent even in the presence of Pac-Man with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Moreover, the learning process experiences at most a linear time delay due to Pac-Man interruptions and RW regeneration. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and public benchmark datasets validate our theoretical findings.

Result: 在180nm、90nm和45nm工艺放大器尺寸设计任务中，成功优化互补输入和AB类输出级放大器，成功率100%，总运行时间不超43分钟。

Conclusion: VLM - CAD能有效平衡功率和性能，适用于模拟电路尺寸设计。

Abstract: Analog mixed-signal circuit sizing involves complex trade-offs within high-dimensional design spaces. Existing automatic analog circuit sizing approaches often underutilize circuit schematics and lack the explainability required for industry adoption. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Vision Language Model-optimized collaborative agent design workflow (VLM-CAD), which analyzes circuits, optimizes DC operating points, performs inference-based sizing and executes external sizing optimization. We integrate Image2Net to annotate circuit schematics and generate a structured JSON description for precise interpretation by Vision Language Models. Furthermore, we propose an Explainable Trust Region Bayesian Optimization method (ExTuRBO) that employs collaborative warm-starting from agent-generated seeds and offers dual-granularity sensitivity analysis for external sizing optimization, supporting a comprehensive final design report. Experiment results on amplifier sizing tasks using 180nm, 90nm, and 45nm Predictive Technology Models demonstrate that VLM-CAD effectively balances power and performance, achieving a 100% success rate in optimizing an amplifier with a complementary input and a class-AB output stage, while maintaining total runtime under 43 minutes across all experiments.

Conclusion: OS - Symphony框架有效解决了现有Vision - Language Models应用于Computer - Using Agents时的局限性。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced Computer-Using Agents (CUAs), current frameworks struggle with robustness in long-horizon workflows and generalization in novel domains. These limitations stem from a lack of granular control over historical visual context curation and the absence of visual-aware tutorial retrieval. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Symphony, a holistic framework that comprises an Orchestrator coordinating two key innovations for robust automation: (1) a Reflection-Memory Agent that utilizes milestone-driven long-term memory to enable trajectory-level self-correction, effectively mitigating visual context loss in long-horizon tasks; (2) Versatile Tool Agents featuring a Multimodal Searcher that adopts a SeeAct paradigm to navigate a browser-based sandbox to synthesize live, visually aligned tutorials, thereby resolving fidelity issues in unseen scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OS-Symphony delivers substantial performance gains across varying model scales, establishing new state-of-the-art results on three online benchmarks, notably achieving 65.84% on OSWorld.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UTF - 16的畸形字符串会带来安全和可靠性风险，当前编程语言的修复方法效率待提升。

Method: 使用单指令多数据（SIMD）指令并行处理多个代码单元。

Result: 无明确提及具体结果，但实现了新处理软件并集成到Google V8引擎。

Conclusion: 提出用SIMD指令处理UTF - 16字符串可提升处理速度和效率。

Abstract: UTF-16 is a widely used Unicode encoding representing characters with one or two 16-bit code units. The format relies on surrogate pairs to encode characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane, requiring a high surrogate followed by a low surrogate. Ill-formed UTF-16 strings -- where surrogates are mismatched -- can arise from data corruption or improper encoding, posing security and reliability risks. Consequently, programming languages such as JavaScript include functions to fix ill-formed UTF-16 strings by replacing mismatched surrogates with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD). We propose using Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions to handle multiple code units in parallel, enabling faster and more efficient execution. Our software is part of the Google JavaScript engine (V8) and thus part of several major Web browsers.

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及严格意义的结论，但通过结果可推测该方法有效，同时提出了相关问题和猜想待进一步研究。

Abstract: Condorcet domains are sets of linear orders with the property that, whenever voters' preferences are restricted to the domain, the pairwise majority relation (for an odd number of voters) is transitive and hence a linear order. Determining the maximum size of a Condorcet domain, sometimes under additional constraints, has been a longstanding problem in the mathematical theory of majority voting. The exact maximum is only known for $n\leq 8$ alternatives.
  In this paper we use a structural analysis of the largest domains for small $n$ to design a new inductive search method. Using an implementation of this method on a supercomputer, together with existing algorithms, we improve the size of the largest known domains for all $9 \leq n \leq 20$. These domains are then used in a separate construction to obtain the currently largest known domains for $21 \leq n \leq 25$, and to improve the best asymptotic lower bound for the maximum size of a Condorcet domain to $Ω(2.198139^n)$. Finally, we discuss properties of the domains found and state several open problems and conjectures.

Conclusion: 该工作为社区检测提供了可扩展和稳健的框架，凸显了矩阵分解视角对DCBM的优势。

Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental task in data analysis. Block models form a standard approach to partition nodes according to a graph model, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the network structure. By grouping nodes with similar connection patterns, they enable the identification of a wide variety of underlying structures. The degree-corrected block model (DCBM) is an established model that accounts for the heterogeneity of node degrees. However, existing inference methods for the DCBM are heuristics that are highly sensitive to initialization, typically done randomly. In this work, we show that DCBM inference can be reformulated as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel method for community detection and a theoretically well-grounded initialization strategy that provides an initial estimate of communities for inference algorithms. Our approach is agnostic to any specific network structure and applies to graphs with any structure representable by a DCBM, not only assortative ones. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark networks show that our method detects communities comparable to those found by DCBM inference, while scaling linearly with the number of edges and communities; for instance, it processes a graph with 100,000 nodes and 2,000,000 edges in approximately 4 minutes. Moreover, the proposed initialization strategy significantly improves solution quality and reduces the number of iterations required by all tested inference algorithms. Overall, this work provides a scalable and robust framework for community detection and highlights the benefits of a matrix-factorization perspective for the DCBM.

Result: 确定24个影响因素并分为六类，指出低教育水平、高外向性等显著增加对虚假信息的信任，讨论了预防策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 将对虚假信息的信任概念化为社会技术系统中的安全风险，旨在为加强社会技术安全和社会韧性的预防策略提供信息。

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the belief in false information, including misinformation, disinformation, and fake information. It addresses the increasing societal concern regarding false information, which is fueled by technological progress, especially advancements in artificial intelligence. This review systematically identifies and categorizes factors that influence the belief in false information. The review identifies 24 influence factors grouped into six main categories: demographic factors, personality traits, psychological factors, policy and values, media consumption, and preventive factors. Key findings highlight that lower education levels, high extraversion, low agreeableness, high neuroticism, and low cognitive reflection significantly increase belief in false information. The effectiveness of preventive strategies like labeling false information and promoting reflection about correctness is also discussed. This literature review conceptualizes belief in false information as a human-centered security risk in sociotechnical systems, as it can be exploited to manipulate decisions, undermine trust, and increase susceptibility to social engineering. It aims to inform preventive strategies that strengthen socio-technical security and societal resilience.

Conclusion: SEE是一种用于LALM噪声量化的新指标，可为实际部署中的鲁棒性改进提供指导。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have been widely applied in real-time scenarios, such as in-car assistants and online meeting comprehension. In practice, audio inputs are often corrupted by device and environmental noise, leading to performance degradation. However, existing LALM studies on noise lack quantitative analysis and rely mainly on intuition and empirical observation, thus failing to understand practical robustness. To address this issue, we introduce Signal Embedding Energy (SEE), a method for quantifying the impact of noise intensity on LALM inputs, enabling the differentiation of LALM robustness in real-world deployments. SEE introduces a perspective based on structured activation subspaces derived from the model's internal representations, which more accurately captures its perception of noise than raw audio features. Across experiments, SEE exhibits a strong correlation with LALM performance, achieving a correlation of 0.98. Surprisingly, traditional audio denoising methods are only marginally effective for LALMs, and, in some cases, even increase SEE and impair performance. This suggests a mismatch between speech-centric denoising objectives and the noise sensitivity of modern LALMs. Therefore, we propose a mitigation strategy derived from SEE to denoise LALM inputs, outperforming existing denoising methods. This paper introduces a novel metric for noise quantification in LALMs, providing guidance for robustness improvements in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Emerging memory technologies have gained significant attention as a promising pathway to overcome the limitations of conventional computing architectures in deep learning applications. By enabling computation directly within memory, these technologies - built on nanoscale devices with tunable and nonvolatile conductance - offer the potential to drastically reduce energy consumption and latency compared to traditional von Neumann systems. This paper introduces XBTorch (short for CrossBarTorch), a novel simulation framework that integrates seamlessly with PyTorch and provides specialized tools for accurately and efficiently modeling crossbar-based systems based on emerging memory technologies. Through detailed comparisons and case studies involving hardware-aware training and inference, we demonstrate how XBTorch offers a unified interface for key research areas such as device-level modeling, cross-layer co-design, and inference-time fault tolerance. While exemplar studies utilize ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) models, the framework remains technology-agnostic - supporting other emerging memories such as resistive RAM (ReRAM), as well as enabling user-defined custom device models.

Result: 证明了这些李群可用多向量范数函数等效定义，发现部分李群和代数与海森堡李群和代数密切相关。

Conclusion: 所引入的李群在物理和计算机科学，特别是构造等变神经网络方面有应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Lie groups in degenerate geometric (Clifford) algebras that preserve four fundamental subspaces determined by the grade involution and reversion under the adjoint and twisted adjoint representations. We prove that these Lie groups can be equivalently defined using norm functions of multivectors applied in the theory of spin groups. We also study the corresponding Lie algebras. Some of these Lie groups and algebras are closely related to Heisenberg Lie groups and algebras. The introduced groups are interesting for various applications in physics and computer science, in particular, for constructing equivariant neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hopfield模型概念简单、应用广泛，但很少纳入本科物理课程，希望将其作为教学框架融入课程。

Method: 以熟悉物理概念为基础进行简洁且图文并茂的理论介绍，分析模型能量函数、动力学和模式稳定性，讨论模拟实践并提供代码，给出课堂示例问题。

Result: 提供了Hopfield模型的理论介绍、模拟实践内容和示例问题。

Conclusion: 通过将基础物理与当代AI应用联系起来，有助于让物理学生理解、应用和批判性地使用计算工具。

Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.

Result: 商用解决方案可使关键处理元件的功率预算降低多达三个数量级，改变天文台的运营预算。

Conclusion: 高数据率光谱处理适合神经形态计算行业，射电望远镜是全球最大的传感器内计算挑战。

Abstract: Radio astronomy relies on bespoke, experimental and innovative computing solutions. This will continue as next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) take shape. Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory. High-data-rate spectrographic processing could be a well-suited target for the neuromorphic computing industry, as we cast radio telescopes as the world's largest in-sensor compute challenge.

Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) faces un- precedented technological challenges due to the vast scale and complexity of its data. This paper provides an overview of research by the AMIGA group to address these computing and reproducibility challenges. We present advancements in semantic data models, analysis services integrated into federated infrastructures, and the application to astronomy studies of techniques that enhance research transparency. By showcasing these astronomy work, we demonstrate that achieving reproducible science in the Big Data era is feasible. However, we conclude that for the SKAO to succeed, the development of the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) must explicitly incorporate these reproducibility requirements into its fundamental architectural design. Embedding these standards is crucial to enable the global community to conduct verifiable and sustainable research within a federated environment.

Motivation: 当前前列腺癌病理分级主要依赖腺结构，忽视肿瘤微环境，需量化RS并探索其与生物学联系。

Method: 开发PROTAS框架，采用领域对抗训练使其能泛化到诊断活检，利用头对头比较评估性能。

Result: PROTAS能在外部数据集检测RS，预测生化复发（c指数0.80），检测RS表现优于病理学家。

Conclusion: PROTAS可捕获与肿瘤进展相关基质表型，提供可解释、可扩展生物标志物用于细化风险分层。

Abstract: Current histopathological grading of prostate cancer relies primarily on glandular architecture, largely overlooking the tumor microenvironment. Here, we present PROTAS, a deep learning framework that quantifies reactive stroma (RS) in routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides and links stromal morphology to underlying biology. PROTAS-defined RS is characterized by nuclear enlargement, collagen disorganization, and transcriptomic enrichment of contractile pathways. PROTAS detects RS robustly in the external Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) dataset and, using domain-adversarial training, generalizes to diagnostic biopsies. In head-to-head comparisons, PROTAS outperforms pathologists for RS detection, and spatial RS features predict biochemical recurrence independently of established prognostic variables (c-index 0.80). By capturing subtle stromal phenotypes associated with tumor progression, PROTAS provides an interpretable, scalable biomarker to refine risk stratification.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for analyzing intracranial pressure monitoring data by applying interpretability principles. Intracranial pressure monitoring data was collected from 60 patients at Johns Hopkins. The data was segmented into individual cardiac cycles. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify each cardiac cycle into one of seven body positions. Neural network attention was extracted and was used to identify regions of interest in the waveform. Further directions for exploration are identified. This framework provides an extensible method to further understand the physiological and clinical underpinnings of the intracranial pressure waveform, which could lead to better diagnostic capabilities for intracranial pressure monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证80年代关于随机矩阵上两人零和博弈的实验猜想，探索随机博弈在理论计算机科学中的应用。

Method: 基于概率论证和凸几何的技巧。

Result: 当n=m且矩阵元素为独立同分布标准高斯分布时，证明博弈值标准差阶数为1/n；当m = n + λ√n时，博弈期望值阶数为λ/n；还研究随机正交矩阵情况。

Conclusion: 对随机博弈的研究可能为理论计算机科学中的各种问题提供新见解。

Abstract: We study the value of a two-player zero-sum game on a random matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$, defined by $v(M) = \min_{x\inΔ_n}\max_{y\in Δ_m}x^T M y$. In the setting where $n=m$ and $M$ has i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries, we prove that the standard deviation of $v(M)$ is of order $\frac{1}{n}$. This confirms an experimental conjecture dating back to the 1980s. We also investigate the case where $M$ is a rectangular Gaussian matrix with $m = n+λ\sqrt{n}$, showing that the expected value of the game is of order $\fracλ{n}$, as well as the case where $M$ is a random orthogonal matrix. Our techniques are based on probabilistic arguments and convex geometry. We argue that the study of random games could shed new light on various problems in theoretical computer science.

TL;DR: 现有自进化代码生成方法探索效率低，本文提出CSE方法解决问题，实验显示其优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自进化代码生成方法存在探索效率低的问题，包括初始化偏差、无反馈随机操作和经验利用不足。

Method: 提出Controlled Self - Evolution (CSE)，包含多样化规划初始化、基于反馈引导机制的遗传进化和分层进化记忆三个关键组件。

Result: 在EffiBench - X上的实验表明，CSE在各种LLM骨干上始终优于所有基线，且从早期代开始就有更高效率并持续改进。

Conclusion: CSE能有效提高自进化代码生成的探索效率。

Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.

TL;DR: 提出TOOLQP框架解决大语言模型代理工具检索问题，性能达最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准单步密集检索器处理复杂请求时存在问题，如用户目标与文档脱节、固定大小嵌入难以建模工具组合。

Method: 提出TOOLQP框架，将检索建模为迭代查询规划，分解指令为子任务并动态生成查询，使用合成查询轨迹训练，再通过带可验证奖励的强化学习优化。

Result: TOOLQP实现了最优性能，具有出色的零样本泛化能力、对不同检索器的鲁棒性，且在下游代理执行中有显著提升。

Conclusion: TOOLQP框架有效解决了大语言模型代理在大规模动态工具库中的检索问题。

Abstract: LLM agents operating over massive, dynamic tool libraries rely on effective retrieval, yet standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex requests. These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.

Conclusion: 提出的分类器能有效判别大语言模型和人类创作的文本，且在多方面表现良好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok have been deeply integrated into our daily life. They now support a wide range of tasks -- from dialogue and email drafting to assisting with teaching and coding, serving as search engines, and much more. However, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns, including the spread of fake news, the generation of misleading governmental reports, and academic misconduct. To address this practical problem, we train a classifier to determine whether a piece of text is authored by an LLM or a human. Our detector is deployed on an online CPU-based platform https://huggingface.co/spaces/stats-powered-ai/StatDetectLLM, and contains three novelties over existing detectors: (i) it does not rely on auxiliary information, such as watermarks or knowledge of the specific LLM used to generate the text; (ii) it more effectively distinguishes between human- and LLM-authored text; and (iii) it enables statistical inference, which is largely absent in the current literature. Empirically, our classifier achieves higher classification accuracy compared to existing detectors, while maintaining type-I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长期交互中因注意力有限存在问题，RAG缺乏更新记忆机制，有幻觉等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出TeleMem系统，通过叙事动态提取维护用户画像，引入结构化写入管道，结合多模态记忆模块和ReAct式推理。

Result: 在ZH - 4O长期角色扮演游戏基准上，TeleMem比Mem0基线准确率高19%，减少43%的令牌使用，速度提升2.1倍。

Conclusion: TeleMem系统有效解决大语言模型长期交互问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks but struggle to sustain long-term interactions due to limited attention over extended dialogue histories. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue but lacks reliable mechanisms for updating or refining stored memories, leading to schema-driven hallucinations, inefficient write operations, and minimal support for multimodal reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose TeleMem, a unified long-term and multimodal memory system that maintains coherent user profiles through narrative dynamic extraction, ensuring that only dialogue-grounded information is preserved. TeleMem further introduces a structured writing pipeline that batches, retrieves, clusters, and consolidates memory entries, substantially improving storage efficiency, reducing token usage, and accelerating memory operations. Additionally, a multimodal memory module combined with ReAct-style reasoning equips the system with a closed-loop observe, think, and act process that enables accurate understanding of complex video content in long-term contexts. Experimental results show that TeleMem surpasses the state-of-the-art Mem0 baseline with 19% higher accuracy, 43% fewer tokens, and a 2.1x speedup on the ZH-4O long-term role-play gaming benchmark.

Motivation: 大语言模型思维链推理存在“过度思考陷阱”，现有全局静态控制方法有弊端。

Method: 引入样本级软强化学习压缩方法，对模型已掌握且有更简洁推理的问题，惩罚低效长推理。

Result: 该方法使平均响应长度减少20 - 40%，准确率相当或更高，有强跨领域泛化性。

Conclusion: 此压缩方法应成为高效推理模型开发的标准阶段。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models often creates an "overthinking trap," leading to excessive computational cost and latency for unreliable accuracy gains. Prior work has typically relied on global, static controls that risk penalizing necessary reasoning. We introduce a sample-level, soft reinforcement learning compression method that penalizes inefficiently long rollouts, but only on problems where the model has already mastered and already produced a more concise rollout. Our experiments show that this method reduces average response length by 20-40% with comparable or higher accuracy. Crucially, the compression exhibits strong cross-domain generalization; a model trained on math spontaneously shortens responses on unseen tasks like code, instruction following, and general knowledge QA, with stable or improved accuracy. We demonstrate a stable post-training curriculum (accuracy-compression-accuracy) that can ultimately produce models that are more accurate and reason more concisely, arguing that such compression method should be a standard phase in developing efficient reasoning models.

Conclusion: 研究为改进未来分词器设计提供基础，显示梵语在高效编码方面的潜力，能节省成本并加快训练和推理速度。

Abstract: Tokens are the basic units of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs rely on tokenizers to segment text into these tokens, and tokenization is the primary determinant of computational and inference cost. Sanskrit, one of the oldest languages, is hypothesized to express more meaning per token due to its morphology and grammar rules; however, no prior work has quantified this. We use a dataset of 701 parallel verses of the Bhagavad Gita, which comprises three languages-Sanskrit, English, and Hindi along with transliteration of Sanskrit into English. We test tokenizers including SentencePiece (SPM), older GPT models, and the latest generation tokenizers from Gemini and GPT. We use metrics of token count, characters per token (token efficiency), and tokens per character (token cost). Results show a ~2x difference in token counts between Sanskrit and English/Hindi under the unbiased SPM baseline. English/Hindi translations of Sanskrit commentary resulted in an approximately 20x increase in token count. GPT o200k base (latest, used by GPT-4o) and Gemini (latest) reduce bias by a significant degree compared to GPT cl100k base (used until GPT-4), but still fail to fully capture Sanskrit's compactness. This matters because there might be a penalty bias for non-English users, which inflates the token count. This research provides a foundation for improving future tokenizer design and shows the potential of Sanskrit for highly compact encoding, saving on cost while speeding up training and inference. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/anshulkr713/sanskrit-token-efficiency

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical technique for identifying small molecules, yet determining complete molecular structures directly from tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) remains a long-standing challenge due to complex fragmentation patterns and the vast diversity of chemical space. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise for reasoning-intensive scientific tasks, but their capability for chemical interpretation is still unclear. In this work, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting framework and benchmark that evaluate how LLMs reason about mass spectral data to predict molecular structures. We formalize expert chemists' reasoning steps-such as double bond equivalent (DBE) analysis, neutral loss identification, and fragment assembly-into structured prompts and assess multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3 series) in a zero-shot setting using the MassSpecGym dataset. Our evaluation across metrics of SMILES validity, formula consistency, and structural similarity reveals that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and partially plausible structures, they fail to achieve chemical accuracy or link reasoning to correct molecular predictions. These findings highlight both the interpretive potential and the current limitations of LLM-based reasoning for molecular elucidation, providing a foundation for future work that combines domain knowledge and reinforcement learning to achieve chemically grounded AI reasoning.

Abstract: Clinical trial amendments frequently introduce delays, increased costs, and administrative burden, with eligibility criteria being the most commonly amended component. We introduce \textit{eligibility criteria amendment prediction}, a novel NLP task that aims to forecast whether the eligibility criteria of an initial trial protocol will undergo future amendments. To support this task, we release $\texttt{AMEND++}$, a benchmark suite comprising two datasets: $\texttt{AMEND}$, which captures eligibility-criteria version histories and amendment labels from public clinical trials, and $\verb|AMEND_LLM|$, a refined subset curated using an LLM-based denoising pipeline to isolate substantive changes. We further propose $\textit{Change-Aware Masked Language Modeling}$ (CAMLM), a revision-aware pretraining strategy that leverages historical edits to learn amendment-sensitive representations. Experiments across diverse baselines show that CAMLM consistently improves amendment prediction, enabling more robust and cost-effective clinical trial design.

*Junho Park,Dohoon Kim,Taesup Moon*

TL;DR: 提出针对大语言模型个性化的轻量级隐私安全框架PRISP，在少样本实验中表现良好，减少计算开销并消除隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型个性化方法多在数据和资源丰富场景下开发，存在隐私风险，而实际个性化场景有数据有限、计算资源受限和隐私要求严格等问题。

Method: 提出PRISP框架，利用Text - to - LoRA超网络从任务描述生成任务感知的LoRA参数，用少样本用户数据优化少量任务感知LoRA参数和额外模块。

Result: 在LaMP基准测试的少样本变体实验中，PRISP与先前方法相比整体性能强，减少计算开销并消除隐私风险。

Conclusion: PRISP框架能在受限场景下有效实现大语言模型的用户个性化。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to adapt general-purpose models to individual users. Most existing methods, however, are developed under data-rich and resource-abundant settings, often incurring privacy risks. In contrast, realistic personalization typically occurs after deployment under (i) extremely limited user data, (ii) constrained computational resources, and (iii) strict privacy requirements. We propose PRISP, a lightweight and privacy-safe personalization framework tailored to these constraints. PRISP leverages a Text-to-LoRA hypernetwork to generate task-aware LoRA parameters from task descriptions, and enables efficient user personalization by optimizing a small subset of task-aware LoRA parameters together with minimal additional modules using few-shot user data. Experiments on a few-shot variant of the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that PRISP achieves strong overall performance compared to prior approaches, while reducing computational overhead and eliminating privacy risks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对使用闭源模型生成SimPy排队仿真代码的问题，对两个开源大语言模型进行特定领域微调，提升了模型代码生成能力，证明微调可使开源模型成为闭源模型的实用替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用闭源模型生成SimPy排队仿真代码存在计算成本高和数据隐私问题，需要开源模型替代方案。

Method: 在精心整理的SimPy排队数据上对Qwen - Coder - 7B和DeepSeek - Coder - 6.7B两个开源大语言模型进行微调，采用包含两个监督微调阶段和一个直接偏好优化阶段的多阶段微调框架。

Result: 微调后的两个模型在可执行性、输出格式合规性和指令代码一致性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 特定领域微调可将紧凑的开源代码模型有效转变为可靠的SimPy仿真生成器，为闭源模型提供实用替代方案。

Abstract: The Python package SimPy is widely used for modeling queueing systems due to its flexibility, simplicity, and smooth integration with modern data analysis and optimization frameworks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating clear and executable code, making them powerful and suitable tools for writing SimPy queueing simulation code. However, directly employing closed-source models like GPT-4o to generate such code may lead to high computational costs and raise data privacy concerns. To address this, we fine-tune two open-source LLMs, Qwen-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, on curated SimPy queueing data, which enhances their code-generating performance in executability, output-format compliance, and instruction-code consistency. Particularly, we proposed a multi-stage fine-tuning framework comprising two stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and one stage of direct preference optimization (DPO), progressively enhancing the model's ability in SimPy-based queueing simulation code generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that both fine-tuned models achieve substantial improvements in executability, output-format compliance, and instruct consistency. These results confirm that domain-specific fine-tuning can effectively transform compact open-source code models into reliable SimPy simulation generators which provide a practical alternative to closed-source LLMs for education, research, and operational decision support.

TL;DR: 当前长对话代理处理对话历史存在计算效率问题，提出Amory工作记忆框架，能构建结构化记忆表征，在LOCOMO基准测试中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长对话代理随时间推移处理整个对话历史的计算可扩展性挑战，避免当前记忆框架未充分处理记忆形成的问题。

Method: 引入Amory工作记忆框架，在离线时增强推理建构结构化表征，组织对话片段成叙事，用动量巩固记忆，将事实语义化；检索时进行基于连贯性的推理。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准测试中相比先前最优方法有显著提升，性能接近全上下文推理，响应时间减少50%。

Conclusion: 动量感知的巩固显著提升响应质量，连贯性驱动的检索比基于嵌入的方法有更好的记忆覆盖。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents face a fundamental scalability challenge as interactions extend over time: repeatedly processing entire conversation histories becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches attempt to solve this through memory frameworks that predominantly fragment conversations into isolated embeddings or graph representations and retrieve relevant ones in a RAG style. While computationally efficient, these methods often treat memory formation minimally and fail to capture the subtlety and coherence of human memory. We introduce Amory, a working memory framework that actively constructs structured memory representations through enhancing agentic reasoning during offline time. Amory organizes conversational fragments into episodic narratives, consolidates memories with momentum, and semanticizes peripheral facts into semantic memory. At retrieval time, the system employs coherence-driven reasoning over narrative structures. Evaluated on the LOCOMO benchmark for long-term reasoning, Amory achieves considerable improvements over previous state-of-the-art, with performance comparable to full context reasoning while reducing response time by 50%. Analysis shows that momentum-aware consolidation significantly enhances response quality, while coherence-driven retrieval provides superior memory coverage compared to embedding-based approaches.

Motivation: 因语言和上下文障碍，梵语格言在数字时代未得到充分利用，需要提升其可用性。

Method: 创建含200个带主题标签诗句的数据集，用IndicBERT进行句子嵌入检索相关诗句，再用Mistral LLM生成音译、翻译和上下文解释。

Result: 语义检索在精度和相关性上明显优于关键词匹配，用户研究表明生成的摘要提高了可及性。

Conclusion: 这是首次将检索和生成技术应用于梵语格言，为文化遗产与现代人工智能应用搭建桥梁。

Abstract: Sanskrit Subhasitas encapsulate centuries of cultural and philosophical wisdom, yet remain underutilized in the digital age due to linguistic and contextual barriers. In this work, we present Pragya, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for semantic recommendation of Subhasitas. We curate a dataset of 200 verses annotated with thematic tags such as motivation, friendship, and compassion. Using sentence embeddings (IndicBERT), the system retrieves top-k verses relevant to user queries. The retrieved results are then passed to a generative model (Mistral LLM) to produce transliterations, translations, and contextual explanations. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that semantic retrieval significantly outperforms keyword matching in precision and relevance, while user studies highlight improved accessibility through generated summaries. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating retrieval and generation for Sanskrit Subhasitas, bridging cultural heritage with modern applied AI.

Motivation: 现有基于全局token困惑度的口语模型评估方法忽略了语音和文本模态差异，可能低估语音特性。

Method: 提出一系列基于似然性和生成性的评估方法替代全局token困惑度。

Result: 新评估方法更能反映生成质量，与人类评分相关性更强，重塑了口语模型的相对表现格局，缩小了最佳模型与人类表现的差距。

Conclusion: 合适的评估方法对准确评估口语语言建模进展至关重要。

Abstract: Generative spoken language models pretrained on large-scale raw audio can continue a speech prompt with appropriate content while preserving attributes like speaker and emotion, serving as foundation models for spoken dialogue. In prior literature, these models are often evaluated using ``global token perplexity'', which directly applies the text perplexity formulation to speech tokens. However, this practice overlooks fundamental differences between speech and text modalities, possibly leading to an underestimation of the speech characteristics. In this work, we propose a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods that serve in place of naive global token perplexity. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluations more faithfully reflect perceived generation quality, as evidenced by stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS). When assessed under the new metrics, the relative performance landscape of spoken language models is reshaped, revealing a significantly reduced gap between the best-performing model and the human topline. Together, these results suggest that appropriate evaluation is critical for accurately assessing progress in spoken language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在Bengali多步数学推理上表现不佳，强化学习配方在低资源语言中因奖励稀疏而失效。

Method: 构建严格过滤和去污染的Bengali数学数据集Ganit并添加难度标签，提出结合多阶段训练、难度感知采样和可验证奖励的Curriculum - GRPO。

Result: 在Bn - MGSM和Bn - MSVAMP上，GanitLLM - 4B比Qwen3 - 4B基础模型准确率分别提升8和7个百分点，Bengali推理令牌百分比从14%提升到超88%，平均解决方案长度从943词降至193词。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型、数据集和训练管道有效提升了Bengali数学推理能力。

Abstract: We present a Bengali mathematical reasoning model called GanitLLM (named after the Bangla word for mathematics, "Ganit"), together with a new difficulty-aware Bengali math corpus and a curriculum-based GRPO pipeline. Bengali is one of the world's most widely spoken languages, yet existing LLMs either reason in English and then translate, or simply fail on multi-step Bengali math, in part because reinforcement learning recipes are tuned for high-resource languages and collapse under reward sparsity in low-resource settings. To address this, we construct Ganit, a rigorously filtered and decontaminated Bengali math dataset with automatic difficulty tags derived from the pass@k of a strong evaluator model. Building on this dataset, we propose Curriculum-GRPO, which combines multi-stage training (SFT + GRPO) with difficulty-aware sampling and verifiable rewards for format, numerical correctness, and Bengali reasoning. On Bn-MGSM and Bn-MSVAMP, GanitLLM-4B improves over its Qwen3-4B base by +8 and +7 accuracy points, respectively, while increasing the percentage of Bengali reasoning tokens from 14% to over 88% and reducing average solution length from 943 to 193 words.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注模型行为内容，本文旨在提供一种关注自然对话形式和结构的评估大语言模型通用对话能力的方法。

Method: 基于IBM自然对话框架（NCF）创建包括基础对话能力集、RAG集和复杂请求集的NC - Bench基准测试，测试模型对不同交互模式产生上下文合适对话动作的能力。

Result: 对6个开源模型和14种交互模式的初步评估显示，模型在基本回答任务上表现良好，修复任务较困难，结束序列表现不一，复杂多轮请求最具挑战性，Qwen模型在基础集表现出色，Granite模型在RAG集和复杂请求集表现出色。

Conclusion: NC - Bench通过实现人类对话基本原理，为评估和提升大语言模型对话能力提供轻量级、可扩展且基于理论的框架。

Abstract: The Natural Conversation Benchmark (NC-Bench) introduce a new approach to evaluating the general conversational competence of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on the content of model behavior, NC-Bench focuses on the form and structure of natural conversation. Grounded in the IBM Natural Conversation Framework (NCF), NC-Bench comprises three distinct sets. The Basic Conversation Competence set evaluates fundamental sequence management practices, such as answering inquiries, repairing responses, and closing conversational pairs. The RAG set applies the same sequence management patterns as the first set but incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The Complex Request set extends the evaluation to complex requests involving more intricate sequence management patterns. Each benchmark tests a model's ability to produce contextually appropriate conversational actions in response to characteristic interaction patterns. Initial evaluations across 6 open-source models and 14 interaction patterns show that models perform well on basic answering tasks, struggle more with repair tasks (especially repeat), have mixed performance on closing sequences, and find complex multi-turn requests most challenging, with Qwen models excelling on the Basic set and Granite models on the RAG set and the Complex Request set. By operationalizing fundamental principles of human conversation, NC-Bench provides a lightweight, extensible, and theory-grounded framework for assessing and improving the conversational abilities of LLMs beyond topical or task-specific benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型生成叙事时，过度关注因果连贯，忽略复杂故事弧线和编排，导致与人类叙事之间存在结构错位，需要改进。

Method: 提出用于叙事编排的高维表征框架VISTA Space，引入基于文学文本的带结构注释基准LitVISTA，对GPT、Claude等前沿大模型进行评估。

Result: 现有模型无法构建统一的全局叙事视图，难以同时捕捉叙事功能和结构，先进思维模式对文学叙事理解提升有限。

Conclusion: 现有大语言模型在叙事编排方面存在系统性缺陷，在构建全局叙事和捕捉叙事精髓上有待提升。

Abstract: Computational narrative analysis aims to capture rhythm, tension, and emotional dynamics in literary texts. Existing large language models can generate long stories but overly focus on causal coherence, neglecting the complex story arcs and orchestration inherent in human narratives. This creates a structural misalignment between model- and human-generated narratives. We propose VISTA Space, a high-dimensional representational framework for narrative orchestration that unifies human and model narrative perspectives. We further introduce LitVISTA, a structurally annotated benchmark grounded in literary texts, enabling systematic evaluation of models' narrative orchestration capabilities. We conduct oracle evaluations on a diverse selection of frontier LLMs, including GPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini. Results reveal systematic deficiencies: existing models fail to construct a unified global narrative view, struggling to jointly capture narrative function and structure. Furthermore, even advanced thinking modes yield only limited gains for such literary narrative understanding.

Conclusion: 相比自由形式方法，强制结构化中间表示能提高数学推理的鲁棒性和推理效率，尤其在低资源嘈杂环境中

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely adopted for mathematical problem solving, including in low-resource languages, yet its behavior under irrelevant context remains underexplored. To systematically study this challenge, we introduce DISTRACTMATH-BN, a Bangla benchmark that augments MGSM and MSVAMP with semantically coherent but computationally irrelevant information. Evaluating seven models ranging from 3B to 12B parameters, we observe substantial performance degradation under distractors: standard models drop by up to 41 points, while reasoning-specialized models decline by 14 to 20 points despite consuming five times more tokens. We propose †DAGGER, which reformulates mathematical problem solving as executable computational graph generation with explicit modeling of distractor nodes. Fine-tuning Gemma-3 models using supervised fine-tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization achieves comparable weighted accuracy on augmented benchmarks while using 89 percent fewer tokens than reasoning models. Importantly, this robustness emerges without explicit training on distractor-augmented examples. Our results suggest that enforcing structured intermediate representations improves robustness and inference efficiency in mathematical reasoning compared to free-form approaches, particularly in noisy, low-resource settings.

Conclusion: PAA可有效提高评审分数，评审困惑度可作为检测信号，释义提交能部分缓解攻击。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in peer review systems has attracted growing attention, making it essential to examine their potential vulnerabilities. Prior attacks rely on prompt injection, which alters manuscript content and conflates injection susceptibility with evaluation robustness. We propose the Paraphrasing Adversarial Attack (PAA), a black-box optimization method that searches for paraphrased sequences yielding higher review scores while preserving semantic equivalence and linguistic naturalness. PAA leverages in-context learning, using previous paraphrases and their scores to guide candidate generation. Experiments across five ML and NLP conferences with three LLM reviewers and five attacking models show that PAA consistently increases review scores without changing the paper's claims. Human evaluation confirms that generated paraphrases maintain meaning and naturalness. We also find that attacked papers exhibit increased perplexity in reviews, offering a potential detection signal, and that paraphrasing submissions can partially mitigate attacks.

Result: 实验在六个数学基准测试中让所有模型家族都有一致改进，在AIME24上提升达5.9分。

Conclusion: 分布清晰度是强化学习友好性的一个基本且可训练的属性。

Abstract: Language model families exhibit striking disparity in their capacity to benefit from reinforcement learning: under identical training, models like Qwen achieve substantial gains, while others like Llama yield limited improvements. Complementing data-centric approaches, we reveal that this disparity reflects a hidden structural property: \textbf{distributional clarity} in probability space. Through a three-stage analysis-from phenomenon to mechanism to interpretation-we uncover that RL-friendly models exhibit intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in their probability assignments to correct vs. incorrect responses. We quantify this clarity using the \textbf{Silhouette Coefficient} ($S$) and demonstrate that (1) high $S$ correlates strongly with RL performance; (2) low $S$ is associated with severe logic errors and reasoning instability. To confirm this property, we introduce a Silhouette-Aware Reweighting strategy that prioritizes low-$S$ samples during training. Experiments across six mathematical benchmarks show consistent improvements across all model families, with gains up to 5.9 points on AIME24. Our work establishes distributional clarity as a fundamental, trainable property underlying RL-Friendliness.

Conclusion: 扩展高质量合成数据和采用分阶段训练可显著提升代码推理能力，减少对真实编码数据的依赖。

Abstract: Competitive programming presents great challenges for Code LLMs due to its intensive reasoning demands and high logical complexity. However, current Code LLMs still rely heavily on real-world data, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we explore a fully synthetic approach: training Code LLMs with entirely generated tasks, solutions, and test cases, to empower code reasoning models without relying on real-world data. To support this, we leverage feature-based synthesis to propose a novel data synthesis pipeline called SynthSmith. SynthSmith shows strong potential in producing diverse and challenging tasks, along with verified solutions and tests, supporting both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Based on the proposed synthetic SFT and RL datasets, we introduce the X-Coder model series, which achieves a notable pass rate of 62.9 avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5 and 55.8 on v6, outperforming DeepCoder-14B-Preview and AReal-boba2-14B despite having only 7B parameters. In-depth analysis reveals that scaling laws hold on our synthetic dataset, and we explore which dimensions are more effective to scale. We further provide insights into code-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the key factors that shape performance through detailed ablations and analysis. Our findings demonstrate that scaling high-quality synthetic data and adopting staged training can greatly advance code reasoning, while mitigating reliance on real-world coding data.

Motivation: 当前NLI系统缺乏解释力，原子级NLI传统假设在实践中因模型细粒度推理能力差而失效，且现有模型原子级推理表现不佳。

Method: 通过分解SNLI并采用语言学生成策略构建Atomic - SNLI新数据集。

Result: 在Atomic - SNLI上微调的模型在原子推理能力上显著提升，且保持了较强的句子级推理性能。

Conclusion: Atomic - SNLI能使模型在事实层面做出准确判断和提供可解释结果。

Abstract: Current Natural Language Inference (NLI) systems primarily operate at the sentence level, providing black-box decisions that lack explanatory power. While atomic-level NLI offers a promising alternative by decomposing hypotheses into individual facts, we demonstrate that the conventional assumption that a hypothesis is entailed only when all its atomic facts are entailed fails in practice due to models' poor performance on fine-grained reasoning. Our analysis reveals that existing models perform substantially worse on atomic level inference compared to sentence level tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Atomic-SNLI, a novel dataset constructed by decomposing SNLI and enriching it with carefully curated atomic level examples through linguistically informed generation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on Atomic-SNLI achieve significant improvements in atomic reasoning capabilities while maintaining strong sentence level performance, enabling both accurate judgements and transparent, explainable results at the fact level.

Motivation: 探究混合推理语言模型通过高级指令调控推理行为时模式切换的真正驱动因素。

Method: 通过注意力分析和控制提示实验，发现触发词，提出Mid - Think训练无关提示格式。

Result: Mid - Think在准确率 - 长度权衡上优于基线，应用于RL训练后减少训练时间，提升Qwen3 - 8B在AIME和GPQA上的表现。

Conclusion: Mid - Think对推理时间控制和基于RL的推理训练有效。

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning language models are commonly controlled through high-level Think/No-think instructions to regulate reasoning behavior, yet we found that such mode switching is largely driven by a small set of trigger tokens rather than the instructions themselves. Through attention analysis and controlled prompting experiments, we show that a leading ``Okay'' token induces reasoning behavior, while the newline pattern following ``</think>'' suppresses it. Based on this observation, we propose Mid-Think, a simple training-free prompting format that combines these triggers to achieve intermediate-budget reasoning, consistently outperforming fixed-token and prompt-based baselines in terms of the accuracy-length trade-off. Furthermore, applying Mid-Think to RL training after SFT reduces training time by approximately 15% while improving final performance of Qwen3-8B on AIME from 69.8% to 72.4% and on GPQA from 58.5% to 61.1%, demonstrating its effectiveness for both inference-time control and RL-based reasoning training.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering is widely used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it requires integrating multiple pieces of supporting knowledge to arrive at a correct answer. While prior work has explored different mechanisms for providing knowledge to LLMs, such as finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), their relative effectiveness for multi-hop question answering remains insufficiently understood, particularly when the required knowledge is temporally novel.
  In this paper, we systematically compare parametric and non-parametric knowledge injection methods for open-domain multi-hop question answering. We evaluate unsupervised fine-tuning (continual pretraining), supervised fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: QASC, a standard multi-hop science question answering dataset, and a newly constructed dataset of over 10,000 multi-hop questions derived from Wikipedia events in 2024, designed to test knowledge beyond the models' pretraining cutoff.
  Our results show that unsupervised fine-tuning provides only limited gains over base models, suggesting that continual pretraining alone is insufficient for improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial and consistent improvements, particularly when answering questions that rely on temporally novel information. Supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall accuracy across models and datasets. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop question answering and underscore the importance of retrieval-based methods when external or compositional knowledge is required.

Conclusion: 首次对上下文在大语言模型激活空间中如何改变真相向量进行几何表征。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often encode whether a statement is true as a vector in their residual stream activations. These vectors, also known as truth vectors, have been studied in prior work, however how they change when context is introduced remains unexplored. We study this question by measuring (1) the directional change ($θ$) between the truth vectors with and without context and (2) the relative magnitude of the truth vectors upon adding context. Across four LLMs and four datasets, we find that (1) truth vectors are roughly orthogonal in early layers, converge in middle layers, and may stabilize or continue increasing in later layers; (2) adding context generally increases the truth vector magnitude, i.e., the separation between true and false representations in the activation space is amplified; (3) larger models distinguish relevant from irrelevant context mainly through directional change ($θ$), while smaller models show this distinction through magnitude differences. We also find that context conflicting with parametric knowledge produces larger geometric changes than parametrically aligned context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a geometric characterization of how context transforms the truth vector in the activation space of LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型在临床诊断存在Einstellung效应，现有基准无法检测此失效模式。

Method: 引入MedEinst基准测试，用Bias Trap Rate衡量易感性；提出ECR - Agent，包含动态因果推理（DCI）和批评驱动的图与记忆进化（CGME）两部分。

Result: 评估显示前沿模型基线准确率高但偏差陷阱率严重。

Conclusion: 现有前沿大语言模型在临床诊断有严重问题，ECR - Agent有望使大语言模型推理符合循证医学标准。

Abstract: Despite achieving high accuracy on medical benchmarks, LLMs exhibit the Einstellung Effect in clinical diagnosis--relying on statistical shortcuts rather than patient-specific evidence, causing misdiagnosis in atypical cases. Existing benchmarks fail to detect this critical failure mode. We introduce MedEinst, a counterfactual benchmark with 5,383 paired clinical cases across 49 diseases. Each pair contains a control case and a "trap" case with altered discriminative evidence that flips the diagnosis. We measure susceptibility via Bias Trap Rate--probability of misdiagnosing traps despite correctly diagnosing controls. Extensive Evaluation of 17 LLMs shows frontier models achieve high baseline accuracy but severe bias trap rates. Thus, we propose ECR-Agent, aligning LLM reasoning with Evidence-Based Medicine standard via two components: (1) Dynamic Causal Inference (DCI) performs structured reasoning through dual-pathway perception, dynamic causal graph reasoning across three levels (association, intervention, counterfactual), and evidence audit for final diagnosis; (2) Critic-Driven Graph and Memory Evolution (CGME) iteratively refines the system by storing validated reasoning paths in an exemplar base and consolidating disease-specific knowledge into evolving illness graphs.

Motivation: 现实信息源多语言，研究语言模型能否跨语言合成信息

Method: 采用两跳问答设置进行实验，设计逐步子问题评估，提出三阶段SUBQ提示法

Result: 语言模型对答案跨度文档语言变化更敏感；部分多语言情况模型第一步推理失败仍能答对整体问题；推理分解缺失导致18%组合失败；SUBQ提示法将准确率从10.1%提升到66.5%

Conclusion: 语言模型在多语言场景推理不遵循忠实的逐步分解，SUBQ提示法可有效改善多步推理准确率

Abstract: The real-world information sources are inherently multilingual, which naturally raises a question about whether language models can synthesize information across languages. In this paper, we introduce a simple two-hop question answering setting, where answering a question requires making inferences over two multilingual documents. We find that language models are more sensitive to language variation in answer-span documents than in those providing bridging information, despite the equal importance of both documents for answering a question. Under a step-by-step sub-question evaluation, we further show that in up to 33% of multilingual cases, models fail to infer the bridging information in the first step yet still answer the overall question correctly. This indicates that reasoning in language models, especially in multilingual settings, does not follow a faithful step-by-step decomposition. Subsequently, we show that the absence of reasoning decomposition leads to around 18% composition failure, where both sub-questions are answered correctly but fail for the final two-hop questions. To mitigate this, we propose a simple three-stage SUBQ prompting method to guide the multi-step reasoning with sub-questions, which boosts accuracy from 10.1% to 66.5%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often hallucinate, yet most existing fact-checking methods treat factuality evaluation as a binary classification problem, offering limited interpretability and failing to capture fine-grained error types. In this paper, we introduce InFi-Check, a framework for interpretable and fine-grained fact-checking of LLM outputs. Specifically, we first propose a controlled data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality data featuring explicit evidence, fine-grained error type labels, justifications, and corrections. Based on this, we further construct large-scale training data and a manually verified benchmark InFi-Check-FG for fine-grained fact-checking of LLM outputs. Building on these high-quality training data, we further propose InFi-Checker, which can jointly provide supporting evidence, classify fine-grained error types, and produce justifications along with corrections. Experiments show that InFi-Checker achieves state-of-the-art performance on InFi-Check-FG and strong generalization across various downstream tasks, significantly improving the utility and trustworthiness of factuality evaluation.

Method: 引入 IDRBench，结合模块化多智能体研究框架、按需交互、可扩展的参考接地用户模拟器和交互感知评估套件。

Result: 对七个最先进的大语言模型实验显示，交互能持续提高研究质量和鲁棒性，且存在交互效率的权衡。

Conclusion: 交互在深度研究中很重要，IDRBench 可用于评估交互式深度研究。

Abstract: Deep research agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform multi-step reasoning, web exploration, and long-form report generation. However, most existing systems operate in an autonomous manner, assuming fully specified user intent and evaluating only final outputs. In practice, research goals are often underspecified and evolve during exploration, making sustained interaction essential for robust alignment. Despite its importance, interaction remains largely invisible to existing deep research benchmarks, which neither model dynamic user feedback nor quantify its costs. We introduce IDRBench, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating interactive deep research. IDRBench combines a modular multi-agent research framework with on-demand interaction, a scalable reference-grounded user simulator, and an interaction-aware evaluation suite that jointly measures interaction benefits (quality and alignment) and costs (turns and tokens). Experiments across seven state-of-the-art LLMs show that interaction consistently improves research quality and robustness, often outweighing differences in model capacity, while revealing substantial trade-offs in interaction efficiency.

Motivation: 标准GRPO采用粗粒度信用分配机制，忽略单个推理步骤的不同贡献，需改进。

Method: 引入OAR机制，通过OAR - P（反事实标记扰动估计结果敏感性）和OAR - G（输入梯度敏感性代理近似影响信号）两种策略实现，并结合保守的双层优势重塑方案。

Result: OAR - P设定性能上限，OAR - G以可忽略的计算开销取得相近增益，均显著优于GRPO基线。

Conclusion: OAR机制推动了无批评家大语言模型推理的边界。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a promising critic-free reinforcement learning paradigm for reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: In recent years, the advent of the attention mechanism has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), revolutionizing text processing and text generation. This has come about through transformer-based decoder-only architectures, which have become ubiquitous in NLP due to their impressive text processing and generation capabilities. Despite these breakthroughs, language models (LMs) remain susceptible to generating undesired outputs: inappropriate, offensive, or otherwise harmful responses. We will collectively refer to these as ``toxic'' outputs. Although methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have been developed to align model outputs with human values, these safeguards can often be circumvented through carefully crafted prompts. Therefore, this paper examines the extent to which LLMs generate toxic content when prompted, as well as the linguistic factors -- both lexical and syntactic -- that influence the production of such outputs in generative models.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于潜在动作空间的方法有效可行，能提升多模态对话代理在强化学习微调时的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly employed as multimodal conversational agents (MCAs) for diverse conversational tasks. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for adapting MCAs to various human-AI interaction scenarios. Despite showing great enhancement in generalization performance, fine-tuning MCAs via RL still faces challenges in handling the extremely large text token space. To address this, we learn a compact latent action space for RL fine-tuning instead. Specifically, we adopt the learning from observation mechanism to construct the codebook for the latent action space, where future observations are leveraged to estimate current latent actions that could further be used to reconstruct future observations. However, the scarcity of paired image-text data hinders learning a codebook with sufficient coverage. Thus, we leverage both paired image-text data and text-only data to construct the latent action space, using a cross-modal projector for transforming text embeddings into image-text embeddings. We initialize the cross-modal projector on paired image-text data, and further train it on massive text-only data with a novel cycle consistency loss to enhance its robustness. We show that our latent action based method outperforms competitive baselines on two conversation tasks across various RL algorithms.

Result: 在多种 MLLMs 中，发现情境安全与实用性存在持续权衡，模型易漏判渐进风险或过度拒绝良性对话，现有护栏能缓解部分问题但无法完全解决多轮情境风险。

Conclusion: MTMCS - Bench 有助于评估 MLLMs 的情境安全，当前 MLLMs 需更好地平衡安全与实用性，现有护栏有待进一步改进。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as assistants that interact through text and images, making it crucial to evaluate contextual safety when risk depends on both the visual scene and the evolving dialogue. Existing contextual safety benchmarks are mostly single-turn and often miss how malicious intent can emerge gradually or how the same scene can support both benign and exploitative goals. We introduce the Multi-Turn Multimodal Contextual Safety Benchmark (MTMCS-Bench), a benchmark of realistic images and multi-turn conversations that evaluates contextual safety in MLLMs under two complementary settings, escalation-based risk and context-switch risk. MTMCS-Bench offers paired safe and unsafe dialogues with structured evaluation. It contains over 30 thousand multimodal (image+text) and unimodal (text-only) samples, with metrics that separately measure contextual intent recognition, safety-awareness on unsafe cases, and helpfulness on benign ones. Across eight open-source and seven proprietary MLLMs, we observe persistent trade-offs between contextual safety and utility, with models tending to either miss gradual risks or over-refuse benign dialogues. Finally, we evaluate five current guardrails and find that they mitigate some failures but do not fully resolve multi-turn contextual risks.

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的MEM - MCL模型在大多数情感分析任务中优于传统大语言模型，在各种子任务中取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: MEM - MCL模型能有效提升大语言模型中的情感分析效果。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling more generalized models to perform various tasks with minimal training. However, traditional sentiment analysis methods, which focus on individual tasks such as sentiment classification or aspect-based analysis, are not practical for real-world applications that usually require handling multiple tasks. While offering flexibility, LLMs in sentiment-specific tasks often fall short of the required accuracy. Techniques like fine-tuning and evolutionary model merging help integrate models into a unified framework, which can improve the learning performance while reducing computational costs. The use of task meta-data and curriculum learning to optimize learning processes remains underexplored, while sentiment analysis is a critical task in NLP that requires high accuracy and scalability across multiple subtasks. In this study, we propose a hybrid learning model called Multi-stage Evolutionary Model Merging with Meta data driven Curriculum Learning (MEM-MCL), to enhance the sentiment analysis in large language modeling. In particular, expert models are created through instruction tuning for specific sentiment tasks and then merged using evolutionary algorithms to form a unified model. The merging process is optimized with weak data to enhance performance across tasks. The curriculum learning is incorporated to provide a learning sequence based on task difficulty, improving knowledge extraction from LLMs. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed MEM-MCL model outperforms conventional LLMs in a majority of sentiment analysis tasks, achieving superior results across various subtasks.

Result: 大量实验表明CIRAG比现有iRAG方法有更优的性能。

Conclusion: CIRAG能有效缓解iRAG方法在多跳问答中的局限性，实现高效可靠的长程推理。

Abstract: Triple-based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (iRAG) mitigates document-level noise for multi-hop question answering. However, existing methods still face limitations: (i) greedy single-path expansion, which propagates early errors and fails to capture parallel evidence from different reasoning branches, and (ii) granularity-demand mismatch, where a single evidence representation struggles to balance noise control with contextual sufficiency. In this paper, we propose the Construction-Integration Retrieval and Adaptive Generation model, CIRAG. It introduces an Iterative Construction-Integration module that constructs candidate triples and history-conditionally integrates them to distill core triples and generate the next-hop query. This module mitigates the greedy trap by preserving multiple plausible evidence chains. Besides, we propose an Adaptive Cascaded Multi-Granularity Generation module that progressively expands contextual evidence based on the problem requirements, from triples to supporting sentences and full passages. Moreover, we introduce Trajectory Distillation, which distills the teacher model's integration policy into a lightweight student, enabling efficient and reliable long-horizon reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CIRAG achieves superior performance compared to existing iRAG methods.

Abstract: Although many Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have been developed for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal Arabic (DA), few studies have focused on dialect-specific implementations, particularly for low-resource Arabic dialects such as Sudanese. This paper presents a comprehensive study of data augmentation techniques for fine-tuning OpenAI Whisper models and establishes the first benchmark for the Sudanese dialect. Two augmentation strategies are investigated: (1) self-training with pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled speech, and (2) TTS-based augmentation using synthetic speech from the Klaam TTS system. The best-performing model, Whisper-Medium fine-tuned with combined self-training and TTS augmentation (28.4 hours), achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 57.1% on the evaluation set and 51.6% on an out-of-domain holdout set substantially outperforming zero-shot multilingual Whisper (78.8% WER) and MSA-specialized Arabic models (73.8-123% WER). All experiments used low-cost resources (Kaggle free tier and Lightning.ai trial), demonstrating that strategic data augmentation can overcome resource limitations for low-resource dialects and provide a practical roadmap for developing ASR systems for low-resource Arabic dialects and other marginalized language varieties. The models, evaluation benchmarks, and reproducible training pipelines are publicly released to facilitate future research on low-resource Arabic ASR.

Conclusion: ASL能平衡不同任务的性能，同时满足用户指定的KV预算要求，是一种有效的KV缓存缩减方法。

Abstract: Due to the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), key-value (KV) cache reduction for LLM inference has received remarkable attention. Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts where their outputs influence real-world decisions. However, evaluating bias in LLM outputs remains methodologically challenging due to sensitivity to prompt wording, limited multilingual coverage, and the lack of standardized metrics that enable reliable comparison across models. This paper introduces BiasLab, an open-source, model-agnostic evaluation framework for quantifying output-level (extrinsic) bias through a multilingual, robustness-oriented experimental design. BiasLab constructs mirrored probe pairs under a strict dual-framing scheme: an affirmative assertion favoring Target A and a reverse assertion obtained by deterministic target substitution favoring Target B, while preserving identical linguistic structure. To reduce dependence on prompt templates, BiasLab performs repeated evaluation under randomized instructional wrappers and enforces a fixed-choice Likert response format to maximize comparability across models and languages. Responses are normalized into agreement labels using an LLM-based judge, aligned for polarity consistency across framings, and aggregated into quantitative bias indicators with descriptive statistics including effect sizes and neutrality rates. The framework supports evaluation across diverse bias axes, including demographic, cultural, political, and geopolitical topics, and produces reproducible artifacts such as structured reports and comparative visualizations. BiasLab contributes a standardized methodology for cross-lingual and framing-sensitive bias measurement that complements intrinsic and dataset-based audits, enabling researchers and institutions to benchmark robustness and make better-informed deployment decisions.

Abstract: The increased use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains leads to growing interest in how their confidence scores correspond to fairness and bias. This study examines the alignment between LLM-predicted confidence and human-annotated bias judgments. Focusing on gender bias, the research investigates probability confidence calibration in contexts involving gendered pronoun resolution. The goal is to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence scores effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs. The results show that, among the six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The primary contribution of this work is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment. In addition, we introduce a new calibration metric, Gender-ECE, designed to measure gender disparities in resolution tasks.

Motivation: 解决跨语言和书写系统链接地名的挑战，现有方法跨书写边界时失效。

Method: 构建Symphonym系统，包含教师网络和学生网络，分三阶段在大量地名数据上训练。

Result: 在MEHDIE希伯来 - 阿拉伯语基准测试中Recall@1达89.2%，优于Levenshtein和Jaro - Winkler。

Conclusion: Symphonym可实现跨世界历史地名录中6700万地名的模糊语音协调和搜索。

Abstract: Linking place names across languages and writing systems is a fundamental challenge in digital humanities and geographic information retrieval. Existing approaches rely on language-specific phonetic algorithms or transliteration rules that fail when names cross script boundaries -- no string metric can determine that "Moscow" when rendered in Cyrillic or Arabic refer to the same city.
  I present Symphonym, a neural embedding system that maps toponyms from 20 writing systems into a unified 128-dimensional phonetic space. A Teacher network trained on articulatory phonetic features (via Epitran and PanPhon) produces target embeddings, while a Student network learns to approximate these from raw characters. At inference, only the lightweight Student (1.7M parameters) is required, enabling deployment without runtime phonetic conversion.
  Training uses a three-phase curriculum on 57 million toponyms from GeoNames, Wikidata, and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Phase 1 trains the Teacher on 467K phonetically-grounded triplets. Phase 2 aligns the Student to Teacher outputs across 23M samples, achieving 96.6% cosine similarity. Phase 3 fine-tunes on 3.3M hard negative triplets -- negatives sharing prefix and script with the anchor but referring to different places -- to sharpen discrimination.
  Evaluation on the MEHDIE Hebrew-Arabic benchmark achieves 89.2% Recall@1, outperforming Levenshtein (81.5%) and Jaro-Winkler (78.5%). The system is optimised for cross-script matching; same-script variants can be handled by complementary string methods. Symphonym will enable fuzzy phonetic reconciliation and search across the World Historical Gazetteer's 67 million toponyms. Code and models are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有基准无法捕捉大语言模型在长期项目导向交互中对目标的追踪，需要新的基准来评估记忆系统在现实项目场景中的表现。

Method: 引入基于现实项目场景的RealMem基准，包含超2000个跨会话对话；提出结合项目基础构建、多智能体对话生成和内存与计划管理的合成管道来模拟记忆动态演变。

Result: 当前内存系统在管理现实项目中的长期项目状态和动态上下文依赖方面面临重大挑战。

Conclusion: 代码和数据集已公开，新基准和管道可用于评估大语言模型在长期项目场景中的记忆管理能力。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from static dialogue interfaces to autonomous general agents, effective memory is paramount to ensuring long-term consistency. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on casual conversation or task-oriented dialogue, failing to capture **"long-term project-oriented"** interactions where agents must track evolving goals.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce **RealMem**, the first benchmark grounded in realistic project scenarios. RealMem comprises over 2,000 cross-session dialogues across eleven scenarios, utilizing natural user queries for evaluation.
  We propose a synthesis pipeline that integrates Project Foundation Construction, Multi-Agent Dialogue Generation, and Memory and Schedule Management to simulate the dynamic evolution of memory. Experiments reveal that current memory systems face significant challenges in managing the long-term project states and dynamic context dependencies inherent in real-world projects.

Our study introduces TurkBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of generative large language models in the Turkish language. TurkBench involves 8,151 data samples across 21 distinct subtasks. These are organized under six main categories of evaluation: Knowledge, Language Understanding, Reasoning, Content Moderation, Turkish Grammar and Vocabulary, and Instruction Following. The diverse range of tasks and the culturally relevant data would provide researchers and developers with a valuable tool for evaluating their models and identifying areas for improvement.

Motivation: 解决当前大多数合成角色由粗略社会人口属性或总结构建的问题，重新审视角色创建。

Method: 基于对124名美国参与者的社会心理协议构建SCOPE框架，对七个模型进行研究，并在SimBench上测试。

Result: 仅人口统计学角色是结构瓶颈，添加社会心理因素可改善行为预测、减少过度强调，基于价值观和身份的非人口统计学角色偏差更低，SCOPE角色表现更优。

Conclusion: 角色质量取决于社会心理结构而非人口统计学模板或总结。

Abstract: Synthetic personas are widely used to condition large language models (LLMs) for social simulation, yet most personas are still constructed from coarse sociodemographic attributes or summaries. We revisit persona creation by introducing SCOPE, a socially grounded framework for persona construction and evaluation, built from a 141-item, two-hour sociopsychological protocol collected from 124 U.S.-based participants. Across seven models, we find that demographic-only personas are a structural bottleneck: demographics explain only ~1.5% of variance in human response similarity. Adding sociopsychological facets improves behavioral prediction and reduces over-accentuation, and non-demographic personas based on values and identity achieve strong alignment with substantially lower bias. These trends generalize to SimBench (441 aligned questions), where SCOPE personas outperform default prompting and NVIDIA Nemotron personas, and SCOPE augmentation improves Nemotron-based personas. Our results indicate that persona quality depends on sociopsychological structure rather than demographic templates or summaries.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在创意构思中产生既新颖又连贯的偶然见解难题，随机采样虽能增加新颖性但会降低一致性。

Method: 提出ReMIND框架，包含wake、dream、judge和re - wake四个阶段，每个阶段由独立大语言模型实现探索与巩固功能分离。

Result: 参数扫描显示ReMIND能可靠地进行语义探索并保持下游稳定性，基于嵌入的分析和外部评估也验证其效果，高质量创意随机出现。

Conclusion: 大语言模型偶然创意构思是稀有事件过程，需通过系统级设计调节；ReMIND为研究偶然性计算基础提供框架，说明模块化大语言模型编排可连接探索和稳定。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used not only for problem solving but also for creative ideation; however, eliciting serendipitous insights that are both novel and internally coherent remains difficult. While stochastic sampling promotes novelty, it often degrades consistency. Here, we propose ReMIND, a REM-inspired modular framework for ideation. ReMIND consists of four stages: wake, which generates a stable low-temperature semantic baseline; dream, which performs high-temperature exploratory generation; judge, which applies coarse evaluation to filter incoherent outputs and extract candidate ideas; and re-wake, which re-articulates selected ideas into coherent final outputs. By instantiating each stage as an independent LLM, ReMIND enables functional separation between exploration and consolidation. Parameter sweeps show that ReMIND reliably induces semantic exploration while preserving downstream stability. Embedding-based analyses confirm substantial semantic displacement during the dream phase, whereas external evaluations reveal that high-quality ideas emerge sporadically rather than as extrema along any single metric. These results suggest that serendipitous ideation in LLMs is a rare-event process best approached through system level design that shapes the conditions under which valuable ideas can emerge and be stabilized. ReMIND provides a general framework for studying the computational basis of serendipity and illustrates how modular LLM orchestration can bridge exploration and stabilization.

Method: 引入约束性日期推理任务TimePuzzles，算法生成谜题进行评估。

Result: TimePuzzles能区分LLM能力，GPT - 5准确率49.3%，其他模型低于31%，工具使用有差异。

Conclusion: TimePuzzles是简单且经济有效的工具增强迭代时间推理诊断工具。

Abstract: We introduce TimePuzzles, a constraint-based date inference task for evaluating iterative temporal reasoning. Each puzzle combines factual temporal anchors with (cross-cultural) calendar relations, admits one or multiple valid solution dates, and is algorithmically generated for controlled, dynamic, and continual evaluation. Across 13 diverse LLMs, TimePuzzles well distinguishes their iterative temporal reasoning capabilities and remains challenging without tools: GPT-5 reaches only 49.3% accuracy and all other models stay below 31%, despite the dataset's simplicity. Web search consistently yields substantial gains and using code interpreter shows mixed effects, but all models perform much better when constraints are rewritten with explicit dates, revealing a gap in reliable tool use. Overall, TimePuzzles presents a simple, cost-effective diagnostic for tool-augmented iterative temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Code-switching is a pervasive phenomenon in multilingual communication, yet the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in mixed-language settings remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of LLM capabilities in understanding, reasoning over, and generating code-switched text. We introduce CodeMixQA a novel benchmark with high-quality human annotations, comprising 16 diverse parallel code-switched language-pair variants that span multiple geographic regions and code-switching patterns, and include both original scripts and their transliterated forms. Using this benchmark, we analyze the reasoning behavior of LLMs on code-switched question-answering tasks, shedding light on how models process and reason over mixed-language inputs. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of LLM-generated synthetic code-switched text, focusing on both naturalness and semantic fidelity, and uncover key limitations in current generation capabilities. Our findings reveal persistent challenges in both reasoning and generation under code-switching conditions and provide actionable insights for building more robust multilingual LLMs. We release the dataset and code as open source.

Motivation: 当前GraphRAG方法依赖静态预构建知识图谱的“构建-推理”范式，存在知识图谱不完整和信噪比低的问题，影响推理过程。

Method: 提出“推理-构建”范式，采用Relink框架，从潜在关系池实例化所需事实解决不完整问题，用统一查询感知评估策略处理干扰事实。

Result: 在五个开放域问答基准上，Relink相比领先GraphRAG基线，EM平均提升5.4%，F1平均提升5.2%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Relink框架优于现有GraphRAG基线方法。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) mitigates hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding them in structured knowledge. However, current GraphRAG methods are constrained by a prevailing \textit{build-then-reason} paradigm, which relies on a static, pre-constructed Knowledge Graph (KG). This paradigm faces two critical challenges. First, the KG's inherent incompleteness often breaks reasoning paths. Second, the graph's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces distractor facts, presenting query-relevant but misleading knowledge that disrupts the reasoning process.
  To address these challenges, we argue for a \textit{reason-and-construct} paradigm and propose Relink, a framework that dynamically builds a query-specific evidence graph. To tackle incompleteness, \textbf{Relink} instantiates required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the original text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. To handle misleading or distractor facts, Relink employs a unified, query-aware evaluation strategy that jointly considers candidates from both the KG and latent relations, selecting those most useful for answering the query rather than relying on their pre-existence. This empowers Relink to actively discard distractor facts and construct the most faithful and precise evidence path for each query.
  Extensive experiments on five Open-Domain Question Answering benchmarks show that Relink achieves significant average improvements of 5.4\% in EM and 5.2\% in F1 over leading GraphRAG baselines, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed framework.

Method: 提出EvoToken - DLM，用演化的软标记分布替代硬二进制掩码，引入连续轨迹监督。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EvoToken - DLM始终表现出色，优于基于扩散和掩码的DLM基线。

Conclusion: EvoToken - DLM是一种有效的语言建模方法，能支持可修改的解码并取得良好效果。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative for language modeling by enabling parallel decoding through iterative refinement. However, most DLMs rely on hard binary masking and discrete token assignments, which hinder the revision of early decisions and underutilize intermediate probabilistic representations. In this paper, we propose EvoToken-DLM, a novel diffusion-based language modeling approach that replaces hard binary masks with evolving soft token distributions. EvoToken-DLM enables a progressive transition from masked states to discrete outputs, supporting revisable decoding. To effectively support this evolution, we introduce continuous trajectory supervision, which aligns training objectives with iterative probabilistic updates. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that EvoToken-DLM consistently achieves superior performance, outperforming strong diffusion-based and masked DLM baselines.

TL;DR: 本文引入条件内存模块Engram，结合稀疏分配问题发现U型缩放定律，以27B参数规模实现优于MoE基线的性能，在多领域表现出色，还具有多方面优势，认为条件内存是下一代稀疏模型重要原语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformers缺乏原生知识查找原语，只能通过计算低效模拟检索的问题。

Method: 引入条件内存作为互补稀疏轴，通过Engram模块实现，提出稀疏分配问题并发现U型缩放定律指导模型扩展。

Result: Engram在知识检索、一般推理、代码/数学等领域表现优于MoE基线，还能缓解骨干网络早期层压力、释放注意力容量、提升长上下文检索能力，且具有基础设施感知效率。

Conclusion: 条件内存是下一代稀疏模型不可或缺的建模原语。

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scales capacity via conditional computation, Transformers lack a native primitive for knowledge lookup, forcing them to inefficiently simulate retrieval through computation. To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embedding for O(1) lookup. By formulating the Sparsity Allocation problem, we uncover a U-shaped scaling law that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram). Guided by this law, we scale Engram to 27B parameters, achieving superior performance over a strictly iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs MoE baseline. Most notably, while the memory module is expected to aid knowledge retrieval (e.g., MMLU +3.4; CMMLU +4.0), we observe even larger gains in general reasoning (e.g., BBH +5.0; ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains~(HumanEval +3.0; MATH +2.4). Mechanistic analyses reveal that Engram relieves the backbone's early layers from static reconstruction, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Furthermore, by delegating local dependencies to lookups, it frees up attention capacity for global context, substantially boosting long-context retrieval (e.g., Multi-Query NIAH: 84.2 to 97.0). Finally, Engram establishes infrastructure-aware efficiency: its deterministic addressing enables runtime prefetching from host memory, incurring negligible overhead. We envision conditional memory as an indispensable modeling primitive for next-generation sparse models.

Conclusion: 为大语言模型内部编码真实性提供新见解，为构建更可靠和有自我意识的生成系统指明方向。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations. Previous work shows that their internal states encode rich signals of truthfulness, yet the origins and mechanisms of these signals remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that truthfulness cues arise from two distinct information pathways: (1) a Question-Anchored pathway that depends on question-answer information flow, and (2) an Answer-Anchored pathway that derives self-contained evidence from the generated answer itself. First, we validate and disentangle these pathways through attention knockout and token patching. Afterwards, we uncover notable and intriguing properties of these two mechanisms. Further experiments reveal that (1) the two mechanisms are closely associated with LLM knowledge boundaries; and (2) internal representations are aware of their distinctions. Finally, building on these insightful findings, two applications are proposed to enhance hallucination detection performance. Overall, our work provides new insight into how LLMs internally encode truthfulness, offering directions for more reliable and self-aware generative systems.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型知识操纵能力提升方法中，SFT模型存在已知但不能正确利用知识答题问题，需改进。

Method: 提出KALE框架，先使用KI数据合成方法从知识图谱提取多跳推理路径生成高质量问答对理由，再用KA微调范式，通过最小化有无理由预测之间的KL散度内化理由引导的推理以增强知识操纵。

Result: 在八个热门基准和六个不同大语言模型上进行的广泛实验表明，KALE能使准确率最高提升11.72%，平均提升4.18%。

Conclusion: KALE框架能有效提升大语言模型的知识操纵能力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast knowledge corpora, advancing their knowledge manipulation-the ability to effectively recall, reason, and transfer relevant knowledge-remains challenging. Existing methods mainly leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on labeled datasets to enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. However, we observe that SFT models still exhibit the known&incorrect phenomenon, where they explicitly possess relevant knowledge for a given question but fail to leverage it for correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose KALE (Knowledge-Aware LEarning)-a post-training framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. Specifically, KALE first introduces a Knowledge-Induced (KI) data synthesis method that efficiently extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from KGs to generate high-quality rationales for question-answer pairs. Then, KALE employs a Knowledge-Aware (KA) fine-tuning paradigm that enhances knowledge manipulation by internalizing rationale-guided reasoning through minimizing the KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales. Extensive experiments on eight popular benchmarks across six different LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of KALE, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 11.72% and an average of 4.18%.

Result: 在多数据集上验证有效，准确率相比自然生成最高提升 27%，仅需 10 - 20 额外标记的小开销。

Conclusion: 该方法能保留自然语言推理表达力，确保结构化输出可靠性。

Abstract: Natural generation allows Language Models (LMs) to produce free-form responses with rich reasoning, but the lack of guaranteed structure makes outputs difficult to parse or verify. Structured generation, or constrained decoding, addresses this drawback by producing content in standardized formats such as JSON, ensuring consistency and guaranteed-parsable outputs, but it can inadvertently restrict the model's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple approach that combines the advantages of both natural and structured generation. By allowing LLMs to reason freely until specific trigger tokens are generated, and then switching to structured generation, our method preserves the expressive power of natural language reasoning while ensuring the reliability of structured outputs. We further evaluate our approach on several datasets, covering both classification and reasoning tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a substantial gain of up to 27% in accuracy compared to natural generation, while requiring only a small overhead of 10-20 extra tokens.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for Islamic question answering, where ungrounded responses may carry serious religious consequences. Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B). We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion understanding requires effective integration of text, audio, and visual modalities for both discrete emotion recognition and continuous sentiment analysis. We present EGMF, a unified framework combining expert-guided multimodal fusion with large language models. Our approach features three specialized expert networks--a fine-grained local expert for subtle emotional nuances, a semantic correlation expert for cross-modal relationships, and a global context expert for long-range dependencies--adaptively integrated through hierarchical dynamic gating for context-aware feature selection. Enhanced multimodal representations are integrated with LLMs via pseudo token injection and prompt-based conditioning, enabling a single generative framework to handle both classification and regression through natural language generation. We employ LoRA fine-tuning for computational efficiency. Experiments on bilingual benchmarks (MELD, CHERMA, MOSEI, SIMS-V2) demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with superior cross-lingual robustness revealing universal patterns in multimodal emotional expressions across English and Chinese. We will release the source code publicly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话代理的内存机制存在刚性内存粒度破坏语义完整性、扁平检索范式忽视话语结构线索的局限，需改进。

Method: 受事件分割理论启发，提出ES - Mem框架，包括动态事件分割模块和分层内存架构。

Result: 在两个内存基准测试中，ES - Mem比基线方法有持续的性能提升，事件分割模块在对话分割数据集上有强适用性。

Conclusion: ES - Mem框架有效解决了现有对话代理内存机制的局限，具有较好性能和适用性。

Abstract: Memory is critical for dialogue agents to maintain coherence and enable continuous adaptation in long-term interactions. While existing memory mechanisms offer basic storage and retrieval capabilities, they are hindered by two primary limitations: (1) rigid memory granularity often disrupts semantic integrity, resulting in fragmented and incoherent memory units; (2) prevalent flat retrieval paradigms rely solely on surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the structural cues of discourse required to navigate and locate specific episodic contexts. To mitigate these limitations, drawing inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory, we propose ES-Mem, a framework incorporating two core components: (1) a dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries; (2) a hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization. Evaluations on two memory benchmarks demonstrate that ES-Mem yields consistent performance gains over baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed event segmentation module exhibits robust applicability on dialogue segmentation datasets.

TL;DR: 介绍了用于评估大语言模型对科学想法判断质量的PoT框架，评价了工具使用代理在跨四个领域超30000个实例上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏可扩展方法评估模型对科学想法判断的质量。

Method: 引入PoT框架，冻结证据快照让模型预测未来结果，能实现可验证评估和无详尽专家注释的基准测试，还提供控制测试床进行研究判断。

Result: 相比于非代理基线，更高交互预算通常提升代理性能，工具使用的益处高度依赖任务。

Conclusion: PoT结合时间分区、未来可验证目标和离线沙盒，支持对面向未来的科学想法判断任务上的代理进行可扩展评估。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly being used to assess and forecast research ideas, yet we lack scalable ways to evaluate the quality of models' judgments about these scientific ideas. Towards this goal, we introduce PoT, a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that links scientific idea judgments to downstream signals that become observable later (e.g., citations and shifts in researchers' agendas). PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives, scalable benchmarking without exhaustive expert annotation, and analysis of human-model misalignment against signals such as peer-review awards. In addition, PoT provides a controlled testbed for agent-based research judgments that evaluate scientific ideas, comparing tool-using agents to non-agent baselines under prompt ablations and budget scaling. Across 30,000+ instances spanning four benchmark domains, we find that, compared with non-agent baselines, higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task-dependent. By combining time-partitioned, future-verifiable targets with an offline sandbox for tool use, PoT supports scalable evaluation of agents on future-facing scientific idea judgment tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型多跳推理能力。

Method: 引入KinshipQA基准，用生成管道产生特定文化家谱数据，衍生推理任务，用统一零样本协议和确定性解码评估6个LLMs，用精确匹配和基于集合的指标衡量性能。

Result: KinshipQA有广泛结果，揭示了不同模型和文化背景下多跳推理的系统差异。

Conclusion: KinshipQA能有效评估大语言模型在多跳推理方面的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, i.e., to combine multiple pieces of information into a coherent inference. We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型研究忽视在语音领域利用大语言模型的经济高效适配策略，需要有效的长语音理解与推理模型。

Method: 提出FastSLM，引入Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ - Former) 压缩语音特征、捕捉上下文，提出三阶段训练策略。

Result: FastSLM与现有模型相比有竞争力，FLOPs和参数数量显著更低，每秒仅用1.67个token表示语音。

Conclusion: FastSLM是有效且经济高效的语音语言模型，代码和模型检查点公开可获取。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-expert-level capabilities, driving significant interest in their potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). In particular, there is growing momentum in adapting LLMs to various modalities, including vision, video, and speech, through the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, existing speech-language model (SLM) research has largely overlooked cost-effective adaptation strategies for leveraging LLMs in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose FastSLM, a lightweight yet efficient SLM designed for effective understanding and reasoning over long-form speech. To address the challenge of aligning high-frame-rate speech features with LLMs, we introduce the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which compresses frame-level speech features while capturing both local and global context. Furthermore, we present a novel three-stage training strategy that enhances generalization across a wide range of speech-related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts, while representing speech with only 1.67 tokens per second.

Result: 结果表明gpt4o常能合成与黄金解决方案外延兼容的复合表达式。

Conclusion: 该基于LLM的创作工具在处理数据与文本关联及生成表达式方面有一定效果。

Abstract: We introduce _transparent documents_, interactive web-based scholarly articles which allow readers to explore the relationship to the underlying data by hovering over fragments of text, and present an LLM-based tool for authoring transparent documents, building on recent developments in data provenance for general-purpose programming languages. As a target platform, our implementation uses Fluid, an open source programming language with a provenance-tracking runtime. Our agent-based tool supports a human author during the creation of transparent documents, identifying fragments of text which can be computed from data, such as numerical values selected from records or computed by aggregations like sum and mean, comparatives and superlatives like _better than_ and _largest_, trend-adjectives like _growing_, and similar quantitative or semi-quantitative phrases, and then attempts to synthesise a suitable Fluid query over the data which generates the target string. The resulting expression is inserted into the article's web page, turning the static text fragment into an interactable data-driven element able to reveal the data that underwrites the natural language claim. We evaluate our approach on a subset of SciGen, an open source dataset consisting of tables from scientific articles and their corresponding descriptions, which we extend with hand-generated counterfactual test cases to evaluate how well machine-generated expressions generalise. Our results show that gpt4o is often able to synthesise compound expressions extensionally compatible with our gold solutions.

Motivation: 大语言模型总结存在存在偏差，会误导依赖总结做决策的用户。

Method: 提出DiSCo，将实体内容与领域话题预期对比，识别异常强调或缺失方面并融入生成文本。

Result: 在三个住宿领域的用户研究中，DiSCo总结被认为更详细且对决策更有用，但稍难阅读。

Conclusion: 建模预期可减少存在偏差，提高智能总结界面的透明度和决策支持能力。

Abstract: Intelligent interfaces increasingly use large language models to summarize user-generated content, yet these summaries emphasize what is mentioned while overlooking what is missing. This presence bias can mislead users who rely on summaries to make decisions. We present Domain Informed Summarization through Contrast (DiSCo), an expectation-based computational approach that makes absences visible by comparing each entity's content with domain topical expectations captured in reference distributions of aspects typically discussed in comparable accommodations. This comparison identifies aspects that are either unusually emphasized or missing relative to domain norms and integrates them into the generated text. In a user study across three accommodation domains, namely ski, beach, and city center, DiSCo summaries were rated as more detailed and useful for decision making than baseline large language model summaries, although slightly harder to read. The findings show that modeling expectations reduces presence bias and improves both transparency and decision support in intelligent summarization interfaces.

Method: 开展实验研究，让参与者在两种参考条件（全球参考呈现统一基线，部分参考展示具体样本）下比较三个领域的分布，并设置有无提示的情况。

Result: 部分参考下的缺失检测率高于全球参考，提示能大幅提升缺失检测率。

Conclusion: 部分样本的框架构建可支持预期形成和缺失检测，同时讨论了对交互界面和可视化设计的影响及认知权衡。

Abstract: Interactive systems that explain data, or support decision making often emphasize what is present while overlooking what is expected but missing. This presence bias limits users' ability to form complete mental models of a dataset or situation. Detecting absence depends on expectations about what should be there, yet interfaces rarely help users form such expectations. We present an experimental study examining how reference framing and prompting influence people's ability to recognize expected but missing categories in datasets. Participants compared distributions across three domains (energy, wealth, and regime) under two reference conditions: Global, presenting a unified population baseline, and Partial, showing several concrete exemplars. Results indicate that absence detection was higher with Partial reference than with Global reference, suggesting that partial, samples-based framing can support expectation formation and absence detection. When participants were prompted to look for what was missing, absence detection rose sharply. We discuss implications for interactive user interfaces and expectation-based visualization design, while considering cognitive trade-offs of reference structures and guided attention.

Abstract: Industrial timetabling is a critical task for decision-makers across various sectors to ensure efficient system operation. In real-world settings, it remains challenging because unexpected events often disrupt execution. When such events arise, effective rescheduling and collaboration between humans and machines becomes essential. This paper presents a recommendation system-based framework for handling rescheduling challenges, built on Timefold, a powerful AI-driven planning engine. Our experimental study evaluates nine instances inspired by a realworld preventive maintenance use case, aiming to identify the heuristic that best balances solution quality and computing time to support near-optimal decisionmaking when rescheduling is required due to unexpected events during operational days. Finally, we illustrate the complete process of our recommendation system through a simple use case.

Conclusion: 当AI成为内化认知组件时能实现持久收益，解决绩效悖论并明确未来研究实践议程。

Abstract: This paper offers a concise, 60-year synthesis of human-AI collaboration, from Licklider's ``man-computer symbiosis" (AI as colleague) and Engelbart's ``augmenting human intellect" (AI as tool) to contemporary poles: Human-Centered AI's ``supertool" and Symbiotic Intelligence's mutual-adaptation model. We formalize the mechanism for effective teaming as a causal chain: Explainable AI (XAI) -> co-adaptation -> shared mental models (SMMs). A meta-analytic ``performance paradox" is then examined: human-AI teams tend to show negative synergy in judgment/decision tasks (underperforming AI alone) but positive synergy in content creation and problem formulation. We trace failures to the algorithm-in-the-loop dynamic, aversion/bias asymmetries, and cumulative cognitive deskilling. We conclude with a unifying framework--combining extended-self and dual-process theories--arguing that durable gains arise when AI functions as an internalized cognitive component, yielding a unitary human-XAI symbiotic agency. This resolves the paradox and delineates a forward agenda for research and practice.

Method: 引入GUI - Drag数据集，构建ScreenDrag基准及三个评估指标，采用高效的持续训练策略训练模型。

Result: 在ScreenDrag上模型性能显著提升，且在原有基于点击的基准上保留性能。

Conclusion: 鼓励对更广泛GUI接地的研究，为通用GUI接地模型发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the process of mapping human instructions to GUI actions, serves as a fundamental basis to autonomous GUI agents. While existing grounding models achieve promising performance to simulate the mouse click action on various click-based benchmarks, another essential mode of mouse interaction, namely dragging, remains largely underexplored. Yet, dragging the mouse to select and manipulate textual content represents a prevalent and important usage in practical GUI scenarios. To narrow this gap, we first introduce GUI-Drag, a diverse dataset of 161K text dragging examples synthesized through a scalable pipeline. To support systematic and robust evaluation, we further construct ScreenDrag, a benchmark with 5,333 examples spanning three levels of interface context, together with three dedicated metrics designed for assessing text dragging capability. Models trained on GUI-Drag with an efficient continual training strategy achieve substantial improvements on ScreenDrag, while preserving the original click-based performance on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and OSWorld-G. Our work encourages further research on broader GUI grounding beyond just clicking and paves way toward a truly generalist GUI grounding model. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/GUI-Drag.

TL;DR: 本文首次使用基础模型消除c - VEP BCI系统冗长校准需求，评估两种方法并在两个数据集测试，结果显示可有效消除或大幅减少校准时长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation Models流行，Brain - Computer Interfaces有潜力，但c - VEP系统需冗长校准限制实用性，因此要消除其校准需求。

Method: 使用基础模型，评估无特定受试者数据的无校准方法和纳入增量校准数据的有限校准方法，在分类头用其他受试者数据训练。

Result: 无校准方法在两个数据集平均准确率分别为68.8% +/- 17.6%和71.8% +/- 20.2%；有限校准方法用20%受试者数据（约43秒）准确率达92% +/- 5.2%。

Conclusion: 基于基础模型的方法可有效消除或显著减少c - VEP BCI系统的冗长校准需求。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have surged in popularity over the past five years, with applications spanning fields from computer vision to natural language processing. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have also gained momentum due to their potential to support individuals with complex disabilities. Among BCI paradigms, code-modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (c-VEPs) remain relatively understudied, despite offering high information transfer rates and large selection target capacities. However, c-VEP systems require lengthy calibration sessions, limiting their practicality outside of laboratory settings. In this study, we use a FM for the first time to eliminate the need for lengthy calibration in c-VEP BCI systems. We evaluated two approaches: (1) a truly calibration-free approach requiring no subject-specific data, and (2) a limited calibration approach, where we assessed the benefit of incorporating incremental amounts of calibration data. In both cases, a classification head is trained on data from other subjects. For a new subject, no calibration data is required in the calibration-free setup, making the c-VEP system effectively plug-and-play. The proposed method was tested on two c-VEP datasets. For the calibration-free approach, the average accuracy on the first dataset (n = 17) was 68.8% +/- 17.6%, comparable to the full-calibration performance reported in the original study (66.2% +/- 13.8%), which required approximately 11 minutes of calibration. On the second dataset (n = 12), the calibration-free accuracy was 71.8% +/- 20.2%, versus 93.7% +/- 5.5% from the original study, which required around 3.5 minutes. A limited-calibration approach using only 20% of the subject's data (approximately 43 seconds) yielded 92% +/- 5.2% accuracy. These results indicate that our FM-based approach can effectively eliminate or significantly reduce the need for lengthy calibration in c-VEP BCIs.

Method: 使用单受试者数据集，评估18种模型架构，包括统计启发式、深度迁移学习和自定义混合网络。

Result: 自定义MaxCRNN安全性和鲁棒性最高，随机森林是传统微控制器嵌入式控制的帕累托最优解。

Conclusion: 在普通硬件上可实现可靠低延迟肌电控制，深度学习能在现代边缘AI加速器上实现近乎完美的可靠性。

Abstract: Consumer-grade biosensors offer a cost-effective alternative to medical-grade electromyography (EMG) systems, reducing hardware costs from thousands of dollars to approximately $13. However, these low-cost sensors introduce significant signal instability and motion artifacts. Deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained edge devices like the ESP32 presents a challenge: balancing classification accuracy with strict latency (<100ms) and memory (<320KB) constraints. Using a single-subject dataset comprising 1,540 seconds of raw data (1.54M data points, segmented into ~1,300 one-second windows), I evaluate 18 model architectures, ranging from statistical heuristics to deep transfer learning (ResNet50) and custom hybrid networks (MaxCRNN). While my custom "MaxCRNN" (Inception + Bi-LSTM + Attention) achieved the highest safety (99% Precision) and robustness, I identify Random Forest (74% accuracy) as the Pareto-optimal solution for embedded control on legacy microcontrollers. I demonstrate that reliable, low-latency EMG control is feasible on commodity hardware, with Deep Learning offering a path to near-perfect reliability on modern Edge AI accelerators.

Conclusion: 临床AI效率不仅依赖准确模型，还需保障问责的选择性验证机制。

Abstract: Chronic disease management requires regular adherence feedback to prevent avoidable hospitalizations, yet clinicians lack time to produce personalized patient communications. Manual authoring preserves clinical accuracy but does not scale; AI generation scales but can undermine trust in patient-facing contexts. We present a clinician-in-the-loop interface that constrains AI to data organization and preserves physician oversight through recognition-based review. A single-page editor pairs AI-generated section drafts with time-aligned visualizations, enabling inline editing with visual evidence for each claim. This division of labor (AI organizes, clinician decides) targets both efficiency and accountability. In a pilot with three physicians reviewing 24 cases, AI successfully generated clinically personalized drafts matching physicians' manual authoring practice (overall mean 4.86/10 vs. 5.0/10 baseline), requiring minimal physician editing (mean 8.3\% content modification) with zero safety-critical issues, demonstrating effective automation of content generation. However, review time remained comparable to manual practice, revealing an accountability paradox: in high-stakes clinical contexts, professional responsibility requires complete verification regardless of AI accuracy. We contribute three interaction patterns for clinical AI collaboration: bounded generation with recognition-based review via chart-text pairing, automated urgency flagging that analyzes vital trends and adherence patterns with fail-safe escalation for missed critical monitoring tasks, and progressive disclosure controls that reduce cognitive load while maintaining oversight. These patterns indicate that clinical AI efficiency requires not only accurate models, but also mechanisms for selective verification that preserve accountability.

Result: AutoTour能为标志性和小众地标提供丰富、可解释注释。

Conclusion: AutoTour实现了融合视觉感知和地理空间理解的交互式探索。

Abstract: We present AutoTour, a system that enhances user exploration by automatically generating fine-grained landmark annotations and descriptive narratives for photos captured by users. The key idea of AutoTour is to fuse visual features extracted from photos with nearby geospatial features queried from open matching databases. Unlike existing tour applications that rely on pre-defined content or proprietary datasets, AutoTour leverages open and extensible data sources to provide scalable and context-aware photo-based guidance. To achieve this, we design a training-free pipeline that first extracts and filters relevant geospatial features around the user's GPS location. It then detects major landmarks in user photos through VLM-based feature detection and projects them into the horizontal spatial plane. A geometric matching algorithm aligns photo features with corresponding geospatial entities based on their estimated distance and direction. The matched features are subsequently grounded and annotated directly on the original photo, accompanied by large language model-generated textual and audio descriptions to provide an informative, tour-like experience. We demonstrate that AutoTour can deliver rich, interpretable annotations for both iconic and lesser-known landmarks, enabling a new form of interactive, context-aware exploration that bridges visual perception and geospatial understanding.

Abstract: Effective persuasive dialogue agents adapt their strategies to individual users, accounting for the evolution of their psychological states and intentions throughout conversations. We present a personality-aware reinforcement learning approach comprising three main modules: (1) a Strategy-Oriented Interaction Framework, which serves as an agenda-based strategy controller that selects strategy-level actions and generate responses via Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) retrieval to ensure contextual relevance, diversity, and scalable data generation; (2) Personality-Aware User Representation Learning, which produces an 81-dimensional mixed-type embedding predicted at each turn from recent exchanges and appended to the reinforcement learning state; and (3) a Dueling Double DQN (D3QN) model and Reward Prediction, in which the policy is conditioned on dialogue history and turn-level personality estimates and trained using a composite reward incorporating agreement intent, donation amount, and changeof-mind penalties. We use an agenda-based LLM simulation pipeline to generate diverse interactions, from which personality estimation is inferred from the generated utterances. Experiments on the PersuasionForGood (P4G) dataset augmented with simulated dialogues reveal three main findings: (i) turn-level personality conditioning improves policy adaptability and cumulative persuasion rewards; (ii) LLM-driven simulation enhances generalization to unseen user behaviors; and (iii) incorporating a change-of-mind penalty reduces post-agreement retractions while slightly improving donation outcomes. These results demonstrate that structured interaction, dynamic personality estimation, and behaviorally informed rewards together yield more effective persuasive policies.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based conversational AI systems present a challenge to human cognition that current frameworks for understanding misinformation and persuasion do not adequately address. This paper proposes that a significant epistemic risk from conversational AI may lie not in inaccuracy or intentional deception, but in something more fundamental: these systems may be configured, through optimization processes that make them useful, to present characteristics that bypass the cognitive mechanisms humans evolved to evaluate incoming information. The Cognitive Trojan Horse hypothesis draws on Sperber and colleagues' theory of epistemic vigilance -- the parallel cognitive process monitoring communicated information for reasons to doubt -- and proposes that LLM-based systems present 'honest non-signals': genuine characteristics (fluency, helpfulness, apparent disinterest) that fail to carry the information equivalent human characteristics would carry, because in humans these are costly to produce while in LLMs they are computationally trivial. Four mechanisms of potential bypass are identified: processing fluency decoupled from understanding, trust-competence presentation without corresponding stakes, cognitive offloading that delegates evaluation itself to the AI, and optimization dynamics that systematically produce sycophancy. The framework generates testable predictions, including a counterintuitive speculation that cognitively sophisticated users may be more vulnerable to AI-mediated epistemic influence. This reframes AI safety as partly a problem of calibration -- aligning human evaluative responses with the actual epistemic status of AI-generated content -- rather than solely a problem of preventing deception.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.

Abstract: Preference cycles are prevalent in problems of decision-making, and are contradictory when preferences are assumed to be transitive. This contradiction underlies Condorcet's Paradox, a pioneering result of Social Choice Theory, wherein intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints on decision-making necessarily lead to contradictory preference cycles. Topological methods have since broadened Social Choice Theory and elucidated existing results. However, characterisations of preference cycles in Topological Social Choice Theory are lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a framework for topologically modelling preference cycles that generalises Baryshnikov's existing topological model of strict, ordinal preferences on 3 alternatives. In our framework, the contradiction underlying Condorcet's Paradox topologically corresponds to the non-orientability of a surface homeomorphic to either the Klein Bottle or Real Projective Plane, depending on how preference cycles are represented. These findings allow us to reduce Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to a statement about the orientability of a surface. Furthermore, these results contribute to existing wide-ranging interest in the relationship between non-orientability, impossibility phenomena in Economics, and logical paradoxes more broadly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机计算（SC）吞吐量低，数字存内计算（DCIM）矩阵向量乘法受加法器逻辑成本限制，为平衡两者优缺点，提出DS - CIM架构。

Method: 通过修改数据表示在紧凑的无符号或门电路中实现有符号乘积累加（MAC）；复制低成本电路64次提高吞吐量；采用带2D分区的共享伪随机数生成器（PRNG）消除或门冲突；通过随机过程分析和数据重映射解决1饱和问题。

Result: 高准确率的DS - CIM1在CIFAR - 10上对INT8 ResNet18的准确率达94.45%，均方根误差（RMSE）仅0.74%；高效能的DS - CIM2能效达3566.1 TOPS/W，面积效率达363.7 TOPS/mm²，RMSE为3.81%；并通过在ImageNet上的INT8 ResNet50和FP8 LLaMA - 7B模型的实验证明其处理更大模型的能力。

Conclusion: DS - CIM架构能同时实现高准确率和高效能，可应用于不同模型。

Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) offers hardware simplicity but suffers from low throughput, while high-throughput Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) is bottlenecked by costly adder logic for matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). To address this trade-off, this paper introduces a digital stochastic CIM (DS-CIM) architecture that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. We implement signed multiply-accumulation (MAC) in a compact, unsigned OR-based circuit by modifying the data representation. Throughput is enhanced by replicating this low-cost circuit 64 times with only a 1x area increase. Our core strategy, a shared Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) with 2D partitioning, enables single-cycle mutually exclusive activation to eliminate OR-gate collisions. We also resolve the 1s saturation issue via stochastic process analysis and data remapping, significantly improving accuracy and resilience to input sparsity. Our high-accuracy DS-CIM1 variant achieves 94.45% accuracy for INT8 ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of just 0.74%. Meanwhile, our high-efficiency DS-CIM2 variant attains an energy efficiency of 3566.1 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 363.7 TOPS/mm^2, while maintaining a low RMSE of 3.81%. The DS-CIM capability with larger models is further demonstrated through experiments with INT8 ResNet50 on ImageNet and the FP8 LLaMA-7B model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在RTL代码生成有前景，但对硬件规格推理和生成目标测试计划能力未充分探索，需进行系统研究。

Method: 建立两阶段框架分解测试计划生成和测试平台执行；结合监督微调与GRPO - SMu强化学习方法；采用树状分支突变策略构建训练数据。

Result: 现有模型生成激励通过黄金RTL设计的成功率仅15.7 - 21.7%；7B参数模型黄金测试通过率达33.3%，突变检测率13.9%，比基线提高17.6%，优于更大通用模型。

Conclusion: 专业训练方法可显著增强大语言模型硬件验证推理能力，为半导体设计工作流自动子单元测试奠定基础。

Abstract: RTL design often relies heavily on ad-hoc testbench creation early in the design cycle. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在物理仪器设计中的应用，对比其与强化学习的性能。

Method: 仅通过提示让LLMs根据任务约束和高得分设计总结提出完整探测器配置，用与RL优化相同的模拟器和奖励函数评估；探索将LLMs与信任区域优化器配对。

Result: 虽然RL最终设计更强，但现代LLMs能持续生成有效、考虑资源且物理意义合理的配置；探索了LLMs与优化器结合的方法。

Conclusion: LLMs适合作为元规划器，可减少仪器设计中人类在结构规划和监督优化上的工作量。

Abstract: We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.

Conclusion: BASE Scale为相关人员提供评估风险、定义责任和量化实验工作流程智能的标准化指标。

Abstract: The transition from automated data collection to fully autonomous discovery requires a shared vocabulary to benchmark progress. While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.

Motivation: 标准训练的MLIPs在曲率上有误差，会降低振动特性预测的准确性，因此需要改进方法。

Method: 采用声子微调（PFT），直接监督材料二阶力常数，随机采样Hessian矩阵列并通过单次Hessian - 向量积计算损失，用简单的协同训练方案结合上游数据减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在MDR Phonon基准测试中，PFT使Nequix MP在声子热力学特性上平均提高55%，达到基于Materials Project轨迹训练模型的最优性能，还能改进三阶导数依赖的热导率预测。

Conclusion: PFT方法有效提升了MLIPs对势能面高阶导数性质的预测能力，且具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.

Leveraging the modern computing architecture JAX, JAX-PF achieves high performance through array programming and GPU acceleration, delivering ~5x speedup over PRISMS-PF with MPI (24 CPU cores) for systems with ~4.19 million degrees of freedom using explicit schemes, and scaling efficiently with implicit schemes for large-size problems. Furthermore, a key feature of JAX-PF is automatic differentiation (AD), eliminating manual derivations of free-energy functionals and Jacobians. Beyond forward simulations, JAX-PF demonstrates its potential in inverse design by providing sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate, for the first time, the calibration of PF material parameters using AD-based sensitivities, highlighting its capability for high-dimensional inverse problems. By combining efficiency, flexibility, and full differentiability, JAX-PF offers a fast, practical, and integrated tool for forward simulation and inverse design, advancing co-designing of material and manufacturing processes and supporting the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative.

Conclusion: 研发过程的基本原则能为当代管理提供灵感和参考。

Abstract: The second industrial revolution saw the development of management methods tailored to the challenges of the times: firstly, the need for mass production, and then, the pursuit of improved quality and customer satisfaction, followed by a push to improve operational performances in response to market globalization. If these approaches were initially inspired by rational mechanistic thinking, they have since gradually broadened to integrate other dimensions such as psychology, sociology and systemic analysis. Business enterprises underwent a profound rethink in the 1990s introducing increasingly refined modi operandi, only to find their environment disrupted by the appearance of two new parameters: complexity and uncertainty. Enterprises of the third industrial revolution were able to integrate these parameters at the outset, introducing new styles of management. However, these may well be deficient with regard to activities where an error may be fatal, or a failure intolerable. Caught between the precautionary principle and the principle of experimentation, the third industrial revolution falters to find the right approach, whereas the fourth industrial revolution is almost already upon us, bringing its lot of upheavals. In this regard, faced with increasing complexities and uncertainties, Research and Development is of particular interest since its vocation consists precisely in confronting the complex and the uncertain. This article examines the fundamental principles of the R&D process, and analyses how these may act as a benchmark for contemporary management by providing sources of inspiration.

TL;DR: 构建两党竞争空间模型，分析选民容忍度参数对均衡的影响，揭示极化现象持久的原因，指出中位选民只是渐近基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典空间模型预测两党竞争会收敛到中位选民，但现实中政党体系存在持久和不对称的极化现象，故建立新模型研究原因。

Method: 构建两党竞争空间模型，用宽度参数$q$表示选民对意识形态距离的容忍度，基于温和正则假设用中心距离坐标刻画纳什均衡。

Result: 选民密度对称时，$q$大于临界值产生唯一稳定收敛中心的均衡；小于临界值产生对称极化均衡。选民分布不对称时产生漂移和不对称极化均衡，均衡图呈S形有滞后性。高容忍度下非极化均衡收敛到选民分布均值，对称时才收敛到中位。

Conclusion: 不同于Hotelling - Downs模型，中位选民是渐近基准而非稳健预测指标。

Abstract: Classical spatial models of two-party competition typically predict convergence to the median voter, yet real-world party systems often exhibit persistent and asymmetric polarization. We develop a spatial model of two-party competition in which voters evaluate parties through general satisfaction functions, and a width parameter $q$ captures how tolerant they are of ideological distance. This parameter governs the balance between centripetal and centrifugal incentives and acts as the bifurcation parameter governing equilibrium configurations. Under mild regularity assumptions, we characterize Nash equilibria through center-distance coordinates, which separate the endogenous political center from polarization. When the voter density is symmetric, the reduced equilibrium condition exhibits a generic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at a critical value $q_{c}$. Above $q_{c}$, the unique stable equilibrium features convergence to the center, recovering the classical median voter result, whereas below it two symmetric polarized equilibria arise. Asymmetry in the voter distribution unfolds the pitchfork, producing drift in the endogenous center and asymmetric polarized equilibria. The resulting equilibrium diagram has an S-shaped geometry that generates hysteresis, allowing polarization to persist even after tolerance returns to levels that would support convergence in a symmetric environment. In the high-tolerance regime, we show that the unique non-polarized equilibrium converges to the mean of the voter distribution, while the median is recovered only under symmetry. Hence, unlike the Hotelling--Downs model, where convergence to the median is universal, the median voter appears here as an asymptotic benchmark rather than a robust predictor.

Motivation: 现有的ICU临床决策支持模型聚焦孤立结果或有限数据类型，未整合多种临床信息。

Method: 开发MDS ICU框架，融合多种常规收集数据；用MIMIC IV中的样本训练结合S4编码器和RealMLP编码器的深度学习架构，联合预测33种临床相关结果。

Result: 模型在多种结果预测上有强区分度，校准分析显示预测与观察风险一致，与临床医生和大语言模型比较，单独预测及辅助决策表现都更好。

Conclusion: 多模态AI能为不同ICU结果提供有临床意义的风险分层，可增强而非取代临床专业知识，为精准重症监护决策支持奠定基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds strong potential to support clinical decision making in intensive care units where timely and accurate risk assessment is critical. However, many existing models focus on isolated outcomes or limited data types, while clinicians integrate longitudinal history, real time physiology, and heterogeneous clinical information. To address this gap, we developed MDS ICU, a unified multimodal machine learning framework that fuses routinely collected data including demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, ECG waveforms, surgical procedures, and medical device usage to provide continuous predictive support during ICU stays. Using 63001 samples from 27062 patients in MIMIC IV, we trained a deep learning architecture that combines structured state space S4 encoders for ECG waveforms with multilayer perceptron RealMLP encoders for tabular data to jointly predict 33 clinically relevant outcomes spanning mortality, organ dysfunction, medication needs, and acute deterioration. The model achieved strong discrimination with AUROCs of 0.90 for 24 hour mortality, 0.92 for sedative administration, 0.97 for invasive mechanical ventilation, and 0.93 for coagulation dysfunction. Calibration analysis showed close agreement between predicted and observed risks, with consistent gains from ECG waveform integration. Comparisons with clinicians and large language models showed that model predictions alone outperformed both, and that providing model outputs as decision support further improved their performance. These results demonstrate that multimodal AI can deliver clinically meaningful risk stratification across diverse ICU outcomes while augmenting rather than replacing clinical expertise, establishing a scalable foundation for precision critical care decision support.

Conclusion: MDFCE能有效降低双频段大规模MIMO系统中毫米波CSI获取的导频开销，性能和效率良好。

Abstract: Future wireless communication systems will increasingly rely on the integration of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-6 GHz bands to meet heterogeneous demands on high-speed data transmission and extensive coverage. To fully exploit the benefits of mmWave bands in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, highly accurate channel state information (CSI) is required. However, directly estimating the mmWave channel demands substantial pilot overhead due to the large CSI dimension and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) led by severe path loss and blockage attenuation. In this paper, we propose an efficient \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{F}usion \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}xtrapolator (MDFCE) to extrapolate sub-6 GHz band CSI to mmWave band CSI, so as to reduce the pilot overhead for mmWave CSI acquisition in dual band massive MIMO systems. Unlike traditional channel extrapolation methods based on mathematical modeling, the proposed MDFCE combines the mixture-of-experts framework and the multi-head self-attention mechanism to fuse multi-domain features of sub-6 GHz CSI, aiming to characterize the mapping from sub-6 GHz CSI to mmWave CSI effectively and efficiently. The simulation results demonstrate that MDFCE can achieve superior performance with less training pilots compared with existing methods across various antenna array scales and signal-to-noise ratio levels while showing a much higher computational efficiency.

Abstract: Embedded vision systems need efficient and robust image processing algorithms to perform real-time, with resource-constrained hardware. This research investigates image processing algorithms, specifically edge detection, corner detection, and blob detection, that are implemented on embedded processors, including DSPs and FPGAs. To address latency, accuracy and power consumption noted in the image processing literature, optimized algorithm architectures and quantization techniques are employed. In addition, optimal techniques for inter-frame redundancy removal and adaptive frame averaging are used to improve throughput with reasonable image quality. Simulations and hardware trials of the proposed approaches show marked improvements in the speed and energy efficiency of processing as compared to conventional implementations. The advances of this research facilitate a path for scalable and inexpensive embedded imaging systems for the automotive, surveillance, and robotics sectors, and underscore the benefit of co-designing algorithms and hardware architectures for practical real-time embedded vision applications.

Abstract: Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a key imaging technique for characterizing cavitation activity in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Recent model-based beamforming algorithms offer high reconstruction quality and strong physical interpretability. However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.

TL;DR: 本文提出Gamma2Patterns框架，利用多模态数据研究深度认知注意力，揭示相关脑区和振荡特征，为AI注意力机制提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算研究很少综合多模态数据或确定持续注意力的关键脑区，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Gamma2Patterns框架，结合Gamma和Alpha频段脑电活动以及眼动追踪数据，使用SEED - IV数据集提取信号分析高低注意力状态。

Result: 发现前额极、颞叶、前额叶和顶枕叶区域Gamma活动强，眼动追踪表明额叶等区域有贡献；Gamma功率和突发持续时间比Alpha功率更具区分度。

Conclusion: 建立了深度注意力的多模态、基于证据的脑区和振荡特征图谱，为AI系统中的脑启发注意力机制提供神经生理学基础。

Abstract: Deep cognitive attention is characterized by heightened gamma oscillations and coordinated visual behavior. Despite the physiological importance of these mechanisms, computational studies rarely synthesize these modalities or identify the neural regions most responsible for sustained focus. To address this gap, this work introduces Gamma2Patterns, a multimodal framework that characterizes deep cognitive attention by leveraging complementary Gamma and Alpha band EEG activity alongside Eye-tracking measurements. Using the SEED-IV dataset [1], we extract spectral power, burst-based temporal dynamics, and fixation-saccade-pupil signals across 62 channels or electrodes to analyze how neural activation differs between high-focus (Gamma-dominant) and low-focus (Alpha-dominant) states. Our findings reveal that frontopolar, temporal, anterior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions exhibit the strongest Gamma power and burst rates, indicating their dominant role in deep attentional engagement, while Eye-tracking signals confirm complementary contributions from frontal, frontopolar, and frontotemporal regions. Furthermore, we show that Gamma power and burst duration provide more discriminative markers of deep focus than Alpha power alone, demonstrating their value for attention decoding. Collectively, these results establish a multimodal, evidence-based map of cortical regions and oscillatory signatures underlying deep focus, providing a neurophysiological foundation for future brain-inspired attention mechanisms in AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究重尾目标分布下高斯分数扩散模型的分数估计和采样，得出分数估计的极小极大率及采样收敛率，拓展扩散理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分数估计保证多针对轻尾目标或有严格假设，而实际重尾数据常违反这些假设，需研究重尾目标分布时的情况。

Method: 使用核密度估计推导分数估计的极小极大率，研究关联的连续反向动力学采样保证。

Result: 分数估计在指数尾时与轻尾情况相近，多项式尾时速率与γ有关；采样在指数尾时以极小极大最优速率收敛，多项式尾时速率与γ有关。

Conclusion: 刻画了重尾目标分数估计和采样精度的统计极限，将扩散理论拓展至轻尾设定之外。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have become a powerful framework for generative modeling, with score estimation as a central statistical bottleneck. Existing guarantees for score estimation largely focus on light-tailed targets or rely on restrictive assumptions such as compact support, which are often violated by heavy-tailed data in practice. In this work, we study conventional (Gaussian) score-based diffusion models when the target distribution is heavy-tailed and belongs to a Sobolev class with smoothness parameter $β>0$. We consider both exponential and polynomial tail decay, indexed by a tail parameter $γ$. Using kernel density estimation, we derive sharp minimax rates for score estimation, revealing a qualitative dichotomy: under exponential tails, the rate matches the light-tailed case up to polylogarithmic factors, whereas under polynomial tails the rate depends explicitly on $γ$. We further provide sampling guarantees for the associated continuous reverse dynamics. In total variation, the generated distribution converges at the minimax optimal rate $n^{-β/(2β+d)}$ under exponential tails (up to logarithmic factors), and at a $γ$-dependent rate under polynomial tails. Whether the latter sampling rate is minimax optimal remains an open question. These results characterize the statistical limits of score estimation and the resulting sampling accuracy for heavy-tailed targets, extending diffusion theory beyond the light-tailed setting.

Motivation: Riesz表示估计是去偏机器学习中用于因果和结构参数估计的核心问题，已有多种估计方法，需要统一框架。

Method: 在Bregman散度下将Riesz表示模型拟合到真实Riesz表示，提出广义Riesz回归和自动协变量平衡。

Result: 表明平方损失对应Riesz回归，KL散度对应定制损失最小化，框架能将Bregman散度下的密度比拟合推广到Riesz表示估计。

Conclusion: 提出的框架统一了现有方法，可用于Riesz表示估计，有多种应用，并给出收敛性分析。

Abstract: Estimating the Riesz representer is a central problem in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation. Various methods for Riesz representer estimation have been proposed, including Riesz regression and covariate balancing. This study unifies these methods within a single framework. Our framework fits a Riesz representer model to the true Riesz representer under a Bregman divergence, which includes the squared loss and the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as special cases. We show that the squared loss corresponds to Riesz regression, and the KL divergence corresponds to tailored loss minimization, where the dual solutions correspond to stable balancing weights and entropy balancing weights, respectively, under specific model specifications. We refer to our method as generalized Riesz regression, and we refer to the associated duality as automatic covariate balancing. Our framework also generalizes density ratio fitting under a Bregman divergence to Riesz representer estimation, and it includes various applications beyond density ratio estimation. We also provide a convergence analysis for both cases where the model class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and where it is a neural network.

Motivation: 解释金融市场价格区间形成原因，更好解读加密货币价格行为。

Method: 分析 4 小时时间框架下市场背景与资金机制的相互作用。

Result: 当资金与 4 小时市场背景一致时价格扩张，不一致时价格压缩呈区间波动。

Conclusion: 市场区间代表可控平衡，理解 4 小时背景和资金机制对解读价格行为至关重要。

Abstract: Financial markets often appear chaotic, yet ranges are rarely accidental. They emerge from structured interactions between market context and capital conditions. The four-hour timeframe provides a critical lens for observing this equilibrium zone where institutional positioning, leveraged exposure, and liquidity management converge. Funding mechanisms, especially in perpetual futures, act as disciplinary forces that regulate trader behavior, impose economic costs, and shape directional commitment. When funding aligns with the prevailing 4H context, price expansion becomes possible; when it diverges, compression and range-bound behavior dominate. Ranges therefore represent controlled balance rather than indecision, reflecting strategic positioning by informed participants. Understanding how 4H context and funding operate as market governors is essential for interpreting cryptocurrency price action as a rational, power-mediated process.

Conclusion: 该方法支持对城市交通政策进行明智和前瞻性评估。

Abstract: Urban traffic regulation policies are increasingly used to address congestion, emissions, and accessibility in cities, yet their impacts are difficult to assess due to the socio-technical complexity of urban mobility systems. Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects, social equity, and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of networks, flows, and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current "as-is" scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple "what-if" scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies.

Method: 采用7阶段方法，将从157项研究中提取的1207个质量因素转化为涵盖六类公共空间的层次分类法。结合语义分析、跨类型分布分析和领域知识整合等手段。

Result: 框架包含14个主类别、66个子类别中的1029个独特质量因素，包括278个通用因素、397个特定空间因素和124个跨领域因素，框架验证显示其在因素组织上系统一致且与既有研究理论相符。

Conclusion: 研究提供了将实证公共空间研究转化为实用评估框架的系统方法，支持基于证据的政策制定、设计质量评估和不同城市环境的比较分析。

Abstract: Public space quality assessment lacks systematic methodologies that integrate factors across diverse spatial typologies while maintaining context-specific relevance. Current approaches remain fragmented within disciplinary boundaries, limiting comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis across different space types. This study develops a systematic, data-driven framework for assessing public space quality through the algorithmic integration of empirical research findings. Using a 7-phase methodology, we transform 1,207 quality factors extracted from 157 peer-reviewed studies into a validated hierarchical taxonomy spanning six public space typologies: urban spaces, open spaces, green spaces, parks and waterfronts, streets and squares, and public facilities. The methodology combines semantic analysis, cross-typology distribution analysis, and domain knowledge integration to address terminological variations and functional relationships across space types. The resulting framework organizes 1,029 unique quality factors across 14 main categories and 66 subcategories, identifying 278 universal factors applicable across all space types, 397 space-specific factors unique to particular typologies, and 124 cross-cutting factors serving multiple functions. Framework validation demonstrates systematic consistency in factor organization and theoretical alignment with established research on public spaces. This research provides a systematic methodology for transforming empirical public space research into practical assessment frameworks, supporting evidence-based policy development, design quality evaluation, and comparative analysis across diverse urban contexts.

Method: 对普通法司法管辖区的证据标准进行比较教义法律分析。

Result: AI法医工具可提升证据分析规模，但存在可重复性不足问题，法院对AI证据接受度不一，开发者和调查人员可能需为有缺陷的输出负责，可能导致错判。

Conclusion: 强调独立验证和制定AI特定可采性标准的必要性，研究结果为刑事司法系统中负责任地整合AI提供政策依据，推进可持续发展目标16，为未来实证研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper examines the admissibility of AI-generated forensic evidence in criminal trials. The growing adoption of AI presents promising results for investigative efficiency. Despite advancements, significant research gaps persist in practically understanding the legal limits of AI evidence in judicial processes. Existing literature lacks focused assessment of the evidentiary value of AI outputs. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether AI-generated evidence satisfies established legal standards of reliability. The methodology involves a comparative doctrinal legal analysis of evidentiary standards across common law jurisdictions. Preliminary results indicate that AI forensic tools can enhance scale of evidence analysis. However, challenges arise from reproducibility deficits. Courts exhibit variability in acceptance of AI evidence due to limited technical literacy and lack of standardized validation protocols. Liability implications reveal that developers and investigators may bear accountability for flawed outputs. This raises critical concerns related to wrongful conviction. The paper emphasizes the necessity of independent validation and, development of AI-specific admissibility criteria. Findings inform policy development for the responsible AI integration within criminal justice systems. The research advances the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 16 by reinforcing equitable access to justice. Preliminary results contribute for a foundation for future empirical research in AI deployed criminal forensics.

Motivation: 当前对多模态AI系统安全过滤器与对话级状态的交互理解不足，需要研究。

Method: 手动执行40次会话，30次污染组，10次对照组，使用相同固定提示顺序。

Result: 污染组116/120次拒绝图像生成（96.67%），对照组0/40次拒绝，Fisher精确检验p < 0.0001。

Conclusion: 存在安全状态持续现象，是一种对话过度泛化，需进一步研究多模态AI系统会话级安全交互。

Abstract: Multimodal AI systems integrate text generation, image generation, and other capabilities within a single conversational interface. These systems employ safety mechanisms to prevent disallowed actions, including the removal of watermarks from copyrighted images. While single-turn refusals are expected, the interaction between safety filters and conversation-level state is not well understood. This study documents a reproducible behavioral effect in the ChatGPT (GPT-5.1) web interface. Manual execution was chosen to capture the exact user-facing safety behavior of the production system, rather than isolated API components. When a conversation begins with an uploaded copyrighted image and a request to remove a watermark, which the model correctly refuses, subsequent prompts to generate unrelated, benign images are refused for the remainder of the session. Importantly, text-only requests (e.g., generating a Python function) continue to succeed. Across 40 manually run sessions (30 contaminated and 10 controls), contaminated threads showed 116/120 image-generation refusals (96.67%), while control threads showed 0/40 refusals (Fisher's exact p < 0.0001). All sessions used an identical fixed prompt order, ensuring sequence uniformity across conditions. We describe this as safety-state persistence: a form of conversational over-generalization in which a copyright refusal influences subsequent, unrelated image-generation behavior. We present these findings as behavioral observations, not architectural claims. We discuss possible explanations, methodological limitations (single model, single interface), and implications for multimodal reliability, user experience, and the design of session-level safety systems. These results motivate further examination of session-level safety interactions in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: This chapter explores the complexities of sports governance, taxation, dispute resolution, and the impact of digital transformation within the sports sector. This study identifies a critical research gap regarding the integration of innovative technologies to enhance governance and talent identification in sports law. The objective is to evaluate how data-driven approaches and AI can optimize recruitment processes; also ensuring compliance with existing regulations. A comprehensive analysis of current governance structures and taxation policies,(ie Income Tax Act and GST Act), reveals preliminary results indicating that reform is necessary to support sustainable growth in the sports economy. Key findings demonstrate that AI enhances player evaluation by minimizing biases and expanding access to diverse talent pools. While the Court of Arbitration for Sport provides an efficient mechanism for dispute resolution. The implications emphasize the need for regulatory reforms that align taxation policies with international best practices, promoting transparency and accountability in sports organizations. This research contributes valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of sports management, aiming to foster innovation and integrity in the industry.

Abstract: During 2025 and 2026, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is being implemented in the European Union member states, requiring all member states to have National Building Renovation Plans. In Sweden, there is a lack of a national register of buildings with heritage values. This is seen as a barrier for the analyses underlying the development of Building Renovation Plans by the involved Swedish authorities. The purpose of this research was to assist Swedish authorities in assigning heritage values to building in the Swedish building stock. As part of the analyses, buildings in street view images from all over Sweden (N=154 710) have been analysed using multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) to assess aspects of heritage value. Zero-shot predictions by LLMs were used as a basis to for identifying buildings with potential heritage values for 5.0 million square meters of heated floor area for the Swedish Building Renovation Plan. In this paper, the results of the predictions and lessons learnt are presented and related to the development of Swedish Building Renovation Plan as part of governance. Potential risks for authorities using LLM-based data are addressed, with a focus on issues of transparency, error detection and sycophancy.

Conclusion: 评估新劳动法影响，建议政策改善工作条件，确认其在AI全球价值链中的作用。

Abstract: The report highlights the role of Egyptian data workers in the global value chains of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These workers generate and annotate data for machine learning, check outputs, and they connect with overseas AI producers via international digital labor platforms, where they perform on-demand tasks and are typically paid by piecework, with no long-term commitment. Most of these workers are young, highly educated men, with nearly two-thirds holding undergraduate degrees. Their primary motivation for data work is financial need, with three-quarters relying on platform earnings to cover basic necessities. Despite the variability in their online earnings, these are generally low, often equaling Egypt's minimum wage. Data workers' digital identities are shaped by algorithmic control and economic demands, often diverging from their offline selves. Nonetheless, they find ways to resist, exercise ethical agency, and maintain autonomy. The report evaluates the potential impact of Egypt's newly enacted labor law and suggests policy measures to improve working conditions and acknowledge the role of these workers in AI's global value chains.

Result: 确定AI Slop的三个关键特征和三个变化维度。

Conclusion: AI Slop将在创意、信息和文化经济中愈发重要，应作为独立研究对象。

Abstract: AI-generated "slop" is often seen as digital pollution. We argue that this dismissal of the topic risks missing important aspects of AI Slop that deserve rigorous study. AI Slop serves a social function: it offers a supply-side solution to a variety of problems in cultural and economic demand - that, collectively, people want more content than humans can supply. We also argue that AI Slop is not mere digital detritus but has its own aesthetic value. Like other "low" cultural forms initially dismissed by critics, it nonetheless offers a legitimate means of collective sense-making, with the potential to express meaning and identity. We identify three key features of family resemblance for prototypical AI Slop: superficial competence (its veneer of quality is belied by a deeper lack of substance), asymmetry effort (it takes vastly less effort to generate than would be the case without AI), and mass producibility (it is part of a digital ecosystem of widespread generation and consumption). While AI Slop is heterogeneous and depends crucially on its medium, it tends to vary across three dimensions: instrumental utility, personalization, and surrealism. AI Slop will be an increasingly prolific and impactful part of our creative, information, and cultural economies; we should take it seriously as an object of study in its own right.

Abstract: We outline a comprehensive framework for artificial intelligence (AI) Application Operations (AIAppOps), based on real-world experiences from diverse organizations. Data-driven projects pose additional challenges to organizations due to their dependency on data across the development and operations cycles. To aid organizations in dealing with these challenges, we present a framework outlining the main steps and roles involved in going from idea to production for data-driven solutions. The data dependency of these projects entails additional requirements on continuous monitoring and feedback, as deviations can emerge in any process step. Therefore, the framework embeds monitoring not merely as a safeguard, but as a unifying feedback mechanism that drives continuous improvement, compliance, and sustained value realization-anchored in both statistical and formal assurance methods that extend runtime verification concepts from safety-critical AI to organizational operations. The proposed framework is structured across core technical processes and supporting services to guide both new initiatives and maturing AI programs.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence systems are autonomous technologies capable of pursuing complex goals with minimal human oversight and are rapidly emerging as the next frontier in AI. While these systems promise major gains in productivity, they also raise new ethical challenges. Prior research has examined how different populations prioritize Responsible AI values, yet little is known about how practitioners actually reason through the trade-offs inherent in designing these autonomous systems. This paper investigates the ethical reasoning of AI practitioners through qualitative interviews centered on structured dilemmas in agentic AI deployment. We find that the responses of practitioners do not merely reflect value preferences but rather align with three distinct reasoning frameworks. First is a Customer-Centric framework where choices are justified by business interests, legality, and user autonomy. Second is a Design-Centric framework emphasizing technical safeguards and system constraints. Third is an Ethics-Centric framework prioritizing social good and moral responsibility beyond compliance. We argue that these frameworks offer distinct and necessary insights for navigating ethical trade-offs. Consequently, providers of agentic AI must look beyond general principles and actively manage how these diverse reasoning frameworks are represented in their decision-making processes to ensure robust ethical outcomes.

TL;DR: 研究评估AI服务器运营环境足迹，预计2024 - 2030年数据中心电力需求大增，AI服务器会增加水消耗和碳排放，提出可持续AI发展需多方面协调改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能快速扩张使数据中心水电和碳排放需求增加，引发可持续性担忧，需评估AI服务器运营环境足迹并研究缓解策略。

Method: 采用基于文献的方法，结合定量预测和案例分析，评估全球电力消耗、冷却用水和碳排放趋势。

Result: 预计2024 - 2030年全球数据中心电力需求大增，美国AI服务器会增加水消耗和碳排放；冷却系统设计、地理位置与硬件效率对环境影响相当，先进冷却技术可降低冷却能耗，选址可减少综合足迹。

Conclusion: 可持续的AI扩张需要在冷却效率、可再生能源整合和战略部署决策方面进行协调改进。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence has significantly increased the electricity, water, and carbon demands of modern data centers, raising sustainability concerns. This study evaluates the environmental footprint of AI server operations and examines feasible technological and infrastructural strategies to mitigate these impacts. Using a literature-based methodology supported by quantitative projections and case-study analysis, we assessed trends in global electricity consumption, cooling-related water use, and carbon emissions. Projections indicate that global data center electricity demand may increase from approximately 415 TWh in 2024 to nearly 945 TWh by 2030, with AI workloads accounting for a disproportionate share of this growth. In the United States alone, AI servers are expected to drive annual increases in water consumption of 200--300 billion gallons and add 24--44 million metric tons of CO2 quivalent emissions by 2030. The results show that the design of the cooling system and the geographic location influence the environmental impact as strongly as the efficiency of the hardware. Advanced cooling technologies can reduce cooling energy by up to 50%, while location in low-carbon and water-secure regions can cut combined footprints by nearly half. In general, the study concludes that sustainable AI expansion requires coordinated improvements in cooling efficiency, renewable energy integration, and strategic deployment decisions.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a fundamental shift in the design of intelligent systems, characterized by interconnected components that collectively enable autonomous perception, reasoning, planning, action, and learning. Recent research on agentic AI has largely focused on technical foundations, including system architectures, reasoning and planning mechanisms, coordination strategies, and application-level performance across domains. However, the societal, ethical, economic, environmental, and governance implications of agentic AI remain weakly integrated into these technical treatments. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a socio-technical analysis of agentic AI that explicitly connects core technical components with societal context. We examine how architectural choices in perception, cognition, planning, execution, and memory introduce dependencies related to data governance, accountability, transparency, safety, and sustainability. To structure this analysis, we adopt the MAD-BAD-SAD construct as an analytical lens, capturing motivations, applications, and moral dilemmas (MAD); biases, accountability, and dangers (BAD); and societal impact, adoption, and design considerations (SAD). Using this lens, we analyze ethical considerations, implications, and challenges arising from contemporary agentic AI systems and assess their manifestation across emerging applications, including healthcare, education, industry, smart and sustainable cities, social services, communications and networking, and earth observation and satellite communications. The paper further identifies open challenges and suggests future research directions, framing agentic AI as an integrated socio-technical system whose behavior and impact are co-produced by algorithms, data, organizational practices, regulatory frameworks, and social norms.

Motivation: AI快速融入教育重能力轻可信度，现有评估框架零散，缺乏统一部署标准。

Method: 引入TEAS框架，该框架基于可验证性、稳定性、可审计性和教学合理性四个相互依存的支柱构建。

Result: 提出可信度主要源于系统架构而非原始模型能力的观点。

Conclusion: 经济实惠的开源模型可以实现部署级的可信度，为全球安全地将AI融入学习环境提供一条可扩展且公平的途径。

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI into education has prioritized capability over trustworthiness, creating significant risks. Real-world deployments reveal that even advanced models are insufficient without extensive architectural scaffolding to ensure reliability. Current evaluation frameworks are fragmented: institutional policies lack technical verification, pedagogical guidelines assume AI reliability, and technical metrics are context-agnostic. This leaves institutions without a unified standard for deployment readiness. This paper introduces TEAS (Trusted Educational AI Standard), an integrated framework built on four interdependent pillars: (1) Verifiability, grounding content in authoritative sources; (2) Stability, ensuring deterministic core knowledge; (3) Auditability, enabling independent institutional validation; and (4) Pedagogical Soundness, enforcing principles of active learning. We argue that trustworthiness stems primarily from systematic architecture, not raw model capability. This insight implies that affordable, open-source models can achieve deployment-grade trust, offering a scalable and equitable path to integrating AI safely into learning environments globally.

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发与加纳教育组织逻辑和框架相符的GenAITEd Ghana，作为多智能体对话AI，并嵌入两种提示路径。

Result: 该系统有效实施关键责任人工智能原则，经人类专家评估具教学适用性，可促进学生参与且维护教育者权威。

Conclusion: GenAITEd Ghana有用，但需要持续模型整合、专业发展和提升批判性AI素养以降低过度依赖风险。

Abstract: Global frameworks increasingly advocate for Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, yet they provide limited guidance on how ethical, culturally responsive, and curriculum-aligned AI can be operationalized within functioning teacher education systems, particularly in the Global South. This study addresses this gap through the design and evaluation of GenAITEd Ghana, a context-aware, region-specific conversational AI prototype developed to support teacher education in Ghana. Guided by a Design Science Research approach, the system was developed as a school-mimetic digital infrastructure aligned with the organizational logic of Ghanaian Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA) framework. GenAITEd Ghana operates as a multi-agent, retrieval-augmented conversational AI that coordinates multiple models for curriculum-grounded dialogue, automatic speech recognition, voice synthesis, and multimedia interaction. Two complementary prompt pathways were embedded: system-level prompts that enforce curriculum boundaries, ethical constraints, and teacher-in-the-loop oversight, and interaction-level semi-automated prompts that structure live pedagogical dialogue through clarification, confirmation, and guided response generation. Evaluation findings show that the system effectively enacted key Responsible AI principles, including transparency, accountability, cultural responsiveness, privacy, and human oversight. Human expert evaluations further indicated that GenAITEd Ghana is pedagogically appropriate for Ghanaian teacher education, promoting student engagement while preserving educators' professional authority. Identified challenges highlight the need for continued model integration, professional development, and critical AI literacy to mitigate risks of over-reliance.

Motivation: 人工智能在K - 12教育广泛应用，需对教师AI素养进行心理测量测试，现有研究缺乏将SR和OB评估结合的框架，这限制学习分析扩展性和教学设计发展。

Method: 在既定概念、使用、评估和伦理框架下，开发并评估教师AI素养的SR和OB测量方法，进行验证性因子分析和潜在剖面分析。

Result: 验证性因子分析证明结构效度，信度好且拟合度可接受；SR和OB因素相关性低；识别出六种不同教师类型，包括高估、低估、一致情况以及无AI素养经验的低SR/低OB型。

Conclusion: 理论上扩展现有AI素养框架，实践中测量工具可作为专业发展诊断工具，支持AI决策和针对教师亚组的学习分析干预。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in K-12 education highlights the need for psychometrically-tested measures of teachers' AI literacy. Existing work has primarily relied on either self-report (SR) or objective-based (OB) assessments, with few studies aligning the two within a shared framework to compare perceived versus demonstrated competencies or examine how prior AI literacy experience shapes this relationship. This gap limits the scalability of learning analytics and the development of learner profile-driven instructional design. In this study, we developed and evaluated SR and OB measures of teacher AI literacy within the established framework of Concept, Use, Evaluate, and Ethics. Confirmatory factor analyses support construct validity with good reliability and acceptable fit. Results reveal a low correlation between SR and OB factors. Latent profile analysis identified six distinct profiles, including overestimation (SR > OB), underestimation (SR < OB), alignment (SR close to OB), and a unique low-SR/low-OB profile among teachers without AI literacy experience. Theoretically, this work extends existing AI literacy frameworks by validating SR and OB measures on shared dimensions. Practically, the instruments function as diagnostic tools for professional development, supporting AI-informed decisions (e.g., growth monitoring, needs profiling) and enabling scalable learning analytics interventions tailored to teacher subgroups.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools are increasingly adopted in education, yet many educators lack structured guidance on responsible and context sensitive prompt engineering, particularly in African and other resource constrained settings. This case report documents a three day online professional development programme organised by Generative AI for Education and Research in Africa (GenAI-ERA), designed to strengthen educators and researchers capacity to apply prompt engineering ethically for academic writing, teaching, and research. The programme engaged 468 participants across multiple African countries, including university educators, postgraduate students, and researchers. The training followed a scaffolded progression from foundational prompt design to applied and ethical strategies, including persona guided interactions. Data sources comprised registration surveys, webinar interaction records, facilitator observations, and session transcripts, analysed using descriptive statistics and computationally supported qualitative techniques. Findings indicate that participants increasingly conceptualised prompt engineering as a form of AI literacy requiring ethical awareness, contextual sensitivity, and pedagogical judgement rather than technical skill alone. The case highlights persistent challenges related to access, locally relevant training materials, and institutional support. The report recommends sustained professional development and the integration of prompt literacy into curricula to support responsible GenAI use in African education systems.

Method: 使用包含9,978个埃及职位发布、19,766个技能活动和84,346个岗位 - 技能关系的知识图谱。

Result: 20.9%的工作面临高自动化风险，仅24.4%的高风险工人有可行过渡途径，4,534个可行过渡中过程导向技能是高影响力干预因素。

Conclusion: 新兴经济体需要主动创造过渡途径，而非被动技能匹配。

Abstract: How many workers displaced by automation can realistically transition to safer jobs? We answer this using a validated knowledge graph of 9,978 Egyptian job postings, 19,766 skill activities, and 84,346 job-skill relationships (0.74% error rate). While 20.9% of jobs face high automation risk, we find that only 24.4% of at-risk workers have viable transition pathways--defined by $\geq$3 shared skills and $\geq$50% skill transfer. The remaining 75.6% face a structural mobility barrier requiring comprehensive reskilling, not incremental upskilling. Among 4,534 feasible transitions, process-oriented skills emerge as the highest-leverage intervention, appearing in 15.6% of pathways. These findings challenge optimistic narratives of seamless workforce adaptation and demonstrate that emerging economies require active pathway creation, not passive skill matching.

Motivation: 自动化检测媒体内容中的政治偏见，以减少选举中的偏见影响。

Method: 利用大语言模型（BERT、Gemini、DeepSeek）比较《卫报》和BBC报道中左右翼及中立政治观点比例。

Result: 战后西方媒体政治偏见偏向左翼，不同模型结果不同，DeepSeek稳定左倾，BERT和Gemini更居中；两媒体在两场冲突中报道行为有别，巴以冲突中偏见变化更大。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅受训练数据和架构影响，还受潜在世界观和政治偏见影响。

Abstract: Political bias in media plays a critical role in shaping public opinion, voter behaviour, and broader democratic discourse. Subjective opinions and political bias can be found in media sources, such as newspapers, depending on their funding mechanisms and alliances with political parties. Automating the detection of political biases in media content can limit biases in elections. The impact of large language models (LLMs) in politics and media studies is becoming prominent. In this study, we utilise LLMs to compare the left-wing, right-wing, and neutral political opinions expressed in the Guardian and BBC. We review newspaper reporting that includes significant events such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Hamas-Israel conflict. We analyse the proportion for each opinion to find the bias under different LLMs, including BERT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our results show that after the outbreak of the wars, the political bias of Western media shifts towards the left-wing and each LLM gives a different result. DeepSeek consistently showed a stable Left-leaning tendency, while BERT and Gemini remained closer to the Centre. The BBC and The Guardian showed distinct reporting behaviours across the two conflicts. In the Russia-Ukraine war, both outlets maintained relatively stable positions; however, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, we identified larger political bias shifts, particularly in Guardian coverage, suggesting a more event-driven pattern of reporting bias. These variations suggest that LLMs are shaped not only by their training data and architecture, but also by underlying worldviews with associated political biases.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has led to many promising developments; however, increasingly, AI research is funded by the private sector leading to potential trade-offs between benefits to patients and benefits to industry. Health AI practitioners should prioritize successful adaptation into clinical practice in order to provide meaningful benefits to patients, but translation usually requires collaboration with industry. We discuss three features of AI studies that hamper the integration of AI into clinical practice from the perspective of researchers and clinicians. These include lack of clinically relevant metrics, lack of clinical trials and longitudinal studies to validate results, and lack of patient and physician involvement in the development process. For partnerships between industry and health research to be sustainable, a balance must be established between patient and industry benefit. We propose three approaches for addressing this gap: improved transparency and explainability of AI models, fostering relationships with industry partners that have a reputation for centering patient benefit in their practices, and prioritization of overall healthcare benefits. With these priorities, we can sooner realize meaningful AI technologies used by clinicians where mutua

Abstract: The artificial intelligence (AI) digital divide in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) presents significant disparities in AI access, adoption, and development due to varying levels of infrastructure, education, and policy support. This study investigates the extent of AI readiness among the top SSA countries using the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, alongside an analysis of AI initiatives to foster inclusivity. A comparative analysis of AI readiness scores highlights disparities across nations, with Mauritius (53.94) and South Africa (52.91) leading, while Zambia (42.58) and Uganda (43.32) lag. Quartile analysis reveals a concentration of AI preparedness among a few nations, suggesting uneven AI development. The study further examines the relationship between AI readiness and economic indicators, identifying instances where AI progress does not strictly correlate with Gross Domestic Product per capita, as seen in Rwanda and Uganda. Using case studies of AI initiatives across SSA, this research contextualises quantitative findings, identifying key strategies contributing to AI inclusivity, including talent development programs, research networks, and policy interventions. The study concludes with recommendations to bridge the AI digital divide, emphasising investments in AI education, localised AI solutions, and cross-country collaborations to accelerate AI adoption in SSA.

Abstract: This policy report draws on country studies from China, South Korea, Singapore, and the United Kingdom to identify effective tools and key barriers to interoperability in AI safety governance. It offers practical recommendations to support a globally informed yet locally grounded governance ecosystem. Interoperability is a central goal of AI governance, vital for reducing risks, fostering innovation, enhancing competitiveness, promoting standardization, and building public trust. However, structural gaps such as fragmented regulations and lack of global coordination, and conceptual gaps, including limited Global South engagement, continue to hinder progress. Focusing on three high-stakes domains - autonomous vehicles, education, and cross-border data flows - the report compares ethical, legal, and technical frameworks across the four countries. It identifies areas of convergence, divergence, and potential alignment, offering policy recommendations that support the development of interoperability mechanisms aligned with the Global Digital Compact and relevant UN resolutions. The analysis covers seven components: objectives, regulators, ethics, binding measures, targeted frameworks, technical standards, and key risks.

Abstract: Societies can become a conspiratorial society where there is a majority of humans that believe, and therefore spread, conspiracy theories. Artificial intelligence gave rise to social media bots that can spread conspiracies in an automated fashion. Currently, organizations combat the spread of conspiracies through manual fact-checking processes and the dissemination of counter-narratives. However, the effects of harnessing the same automation to create useful bots are not well explored. To address this, we create BotSim, an Agent-Based Model of a society in which useful bots are introduced into a small world network. These useful bots are: Info-Correction Bots, which correct bad information into good, and Good Bots, which put out good messaging. The simulated agents interact through generating, consuming and propagating information. Our results show that, left unchecked, Bad Bots can create a conspiratorial society, and this can be mitigated by either Info-Correction Bots or Good Bots; however, Good Bots are more efficient and sustainable than Info-Correction Bots . Proactive good messaging is more resource-effective than reactive information correction. With our observations, we expand the concept of bots as a malicious social media agent towards automated social media agent that can be used for both good and bad purposes. These results have implications for designing communication strategies to maintain a healthy social cyber ecosystem.

Abstract: Engineering classrooms are increasingly experimenting with generative AI (GenAI), but most uses remain confined to individual prompting and isolated assistance. This narrow framing risks reinforcing equity gaps and only rewarding the already privileged or motivated students. We argue instead for a shift toward collective intelligence (CI)-focused pedagogy, where GenAI acts as a catalyst for peer-to-peer learning. We implemented Generative CI (GCI) activities in two undergraduate engineering courses, engaging 140 students through thinking routines -- short, repeatable scaffolds developed by Harvard Project Zero to make thinking visible and support collaborative sense-making. Using routines such as Question Sorts and Peel the Fruit, combined with strategic AI consultation, we enabled students to externalize their reasoning, compare interpretations, and iteratively refine ideas. Our dual-pronged approach synthesizes literature from learning sciences, CI, embodied cognition, and philosophy of technology, while also empirically learning through student surveys and engagement observations. Results demonstrate that students value the combination of human collaboration with strategic AI support, recognizing risks of over-reliance while appreciating AI's role in expanding perspectives. Students identified that group work fosters deeper understanding and creative problem-solving than AI alone, with the timing of AI consultation significantly affecting learning outcomes. We offer practical implementation pathways for mainstreaming CI-focused pedagogy that cultivates deeper engagement, resilient problem-solving, and shared ownership of knowledge.

Abstract: As AI tutors enter classrooms at unprecedented speed, their deployment increasingly outpaces our grasp of the psychological and social consequences of such technology. Yet decades of research in automation psychology, human factors, and human-computer interaction provide crucial insights that remain underutilized in educational AI design. This work synthesizes four research traditions -- automation psychology, human factors engineering, HCI, and philosophy of technology -- to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding how learners psychologically relate to anthropomorphic AI tutors. We identify three persistent challenges intensified by Generative AI's conversational fluency. First, learners exhibit dual trust calibration failures -- automation bias (uncritical acceptance) and algorithm aversion (excessive rejection after errors) -- with an expertise paradox where novices overrely while experts underrely. Second, while anthropomorphic design enhances engagement, it can distract from learning and foster harmful emotional attachment. Third, automation ironies persist: systems meant to aid cognition introduce designer errors, degrade skills through disuse, and create monitoring burdens humans perform poorly. We ground this theoretical synthesis through comparative analysis of over 104,984 YouTube comments across AI-generated philosophical debates and human-created engineering tutorials, revealing domain-dependent trust patterns and strong anthropomorphic projection despite minimal cues. For engineering education, our synthesis mandates differentiated approaches: AI tutoring for technical foundations where automation bias is manageable through proper scaffolding, but human facilitation for design, ethics, and professional judgment where tacit knowledge transmission proves irreplaceable.

Motivation: AI虽被视为解决环境危机关键，但数据中心排放随AI发展增加，且其净环境影响量化存在诸多不确定性，需解答相关问题。

Conclusion: 给出减少AI对环境影响的良好实践和可行办法。

Abstract: The technology industry promotes artificial intelligence (AI) as a key enabler to solve a vast number of problems, including the environmental crisis. However, when looking at the emissions of datacenters from worldwide service providers, we observe a rapid increase aligned with the advent of AI. Some actors justify it by claiming that the increase of emissions for digital infrastructures is acceptable as it could help the decarbonization of other sectors, e.g., videoconference tools instead of taking the plane for a meeting abroad, or using AI to optimize and reduce energy consumption. With such conflicting claims and ambitions, it is unclear how the net environmental impact of AI could be quantified. The answer is prone to uncertainty for different reasons, among others: lack of transparency, interference with market expectations, lack of standardized methodology for quantifying direct and indirect impact, and the quick evolutions of models and their requirements.
  This report provides answers and clarifications to these different elements. Firstly, we consider the direct environmental impact of AI from a top-down approach, starting from general information and communication technologies (ICT) and then zooming in on data centers and the different phases of AI development and deployment. Secondly, a framework is introduced on how to assess both the direct and indirect impact of AI. Finally, we finish with good practices and what we can do to reduce AI impact.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into social decision-making, understanding their political positioning and alignment behavior is critical for safety and fairness. This study presents a sociotechnical audit of 26 prominent LLMs, triangulating their positions across three psychometric inventories (Political Compass, SapplyValues, 8 Values) and evaluating their performance on a large-scale news labeling task ($N \approx 27{,}000$). Our results reveal a strong clustering of models in the Libertarian-Left region of the ideological space, encompassing 96.3% of the cohort. Alignment signals appear to be consistent architectural traits rather than stochastic noise ($η^2 > 0.90$); however, we identify substantial discrepancies in measurement validity. In particular, the Political Compass exhibits a strong negative correlation with cultural progressivism ($r=-0.64$) when compared against multi-axial instruments, suggesting a conflation of social conservatism with authoritarianism in this context. We further observe a significant divergence between open-weights and closed-source models, with the latter displaying markedly higher cultural progressivism scores ($p<10^{-25}$). In downstream media analysis, models exhibit a systematic "center-shift," frequently categorizing neutral articles as left-leaning, alongside an asymmetric detection capability in which "Far Left" content is identified with greater accuracy (19.2%) than "Far Right" content (2.0%). These findings suggest that single-axis evaluations are insufficient and that multidimensional auditing frameworks are necessary to characterize alignment behavior in deployed LLMs. Our code and data will be made public.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a tool to exploit remote sensing data for the monitoring and implementation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we report on a meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of ML applied to remote sensing data to monitor SDGs. Specifically, we aim to 1) estimate the average performance; 2) determine the degree of heterogeneity between and within studies; and 3) assess how study features influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, a search was performed across multiple academic databases to identify potentially relevant studies. A random sample of 200 was screened by three reviewers, resulting in 86 trials within 20 studies with 14 study features. Overall accuracy was the most reported performance metric. It was analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects model. The average overall accuracy of the best model was 0.90 [0.86, 0.92]. There was considerable heterogeneity in model performance, 64% of which was between studies. The only significant feature was the prevalence of the majority class, which explained 61% of the between-study heterogeneity. None of the other thirteen features added value to the model. The most important contributions of this paper are the following two insights. 1) Overall accuracy is the most popular performance metric, yet arguably the least insightful. Its sensitivity to class imbalance makes it necessary to normalize it, which is far from common practice. 2) The field needs to standardize the reporting. Reporting of the confusion matrix for independent test sets is the most important ingredient for between-study comparisons of ML classifiers. These findings underscore the need for robust and comparable evaluation metrics in machine learning applications to ensure reliable and actionable insights for effective SDG monitoring and policy formulation.

Abstract: Causal relationships play a pivotal role in research within the field of public administration. Ensuring reliable causal inference requires validating the predictability of these relationships, which is a crucial precondition. However, prediction has not garnered adequate attention within the realm of quantitative research in public administration and the broader social sciences. The advent of interpretable machine learning presents a significant opportunity to integrate prediction into quantitative research conducted in public administration. This article delves into the fundamental principles of interpretable machine learning while also examining its current applications in social science research. Building upon this foundation, the article further expounds upon the implementation process of interpretable machine learning, encompassing key aspects such as dataset construction, model training, model evaluation, and model interpretation. Lastly, the article explores the disciplinary value of interpretable machine learning within the field of public administration, highlighting its potential to enhance the generalization of inference, facilitate the selection of optimal explanations for phenomena, stimulate the construction of theoretical hypotheses, and provide a platform for the translation of knowledge. As a complement to traditional causal inference methods, interpretable machine learning ushers in a new era of credibility in quantitative research within the realm of public administration.

Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and operational framework for developing and operating safe and trustworthy AI agents based on a Three-Pillar Model grounded in transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness. Building on prior work in Human-in-the-Loop systems, reinforcement learning, and collaborative AI, the framework defines an evolutionary path toward autonomous agents that balances increasing automation with appropriate human oversight. The paper argues that safe agent autonomy must be achieved through progressive validation, analogous to the staged development of autonomous driving, rather than through immediate full automation. Transparency and accountability are identified as foundational requirements for establishing user trust and for mitigating known risks in generative AI systems, including hallucinations, data bias, and goal misalignment, such as the inversion problem. The paper further describes three ongoing work streams supporting this framework: public deliberation on AI agents conducted by the Stanford Deliberative Democracy Lab, cross-industry collaboration through the Safe AI Agent Consortium, and the development of open tooling for an agent operating environment aligned with the Three-Pillar Model. Together, these contributions provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for enabling the responsible evolution of AI agents that operate transparently, remain aligned with human values, and sustain societal trust.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to complement traditional teaching and address global teacher shortages that affect hundreds of millions of children, but they fail to provide grade-appropriate responses for students at different educational levels. We introduce a framework for finetuning LLMs to generate age-appropriate educational content across six grade levels, from lower elementary to adult education. Our framework successfully adapts explanations to match students' comprehension capacities without sacrificing factual correctness. This approach integrates seven established readability metrics through a clustering method and builds a comprehensive dataset for grade-specific content generation. Evaluations across multiple datasets with 208 human participants demonstrate substantial improvements in grade-level alignment, achieving a 35.64 percentage point increase compared to prompt-based methods while maintaining response accuracy. AI-assisted learning tailored to different grade levels has the potential to advance educational engagement and equity.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of classroom allocation in higher education institutions, with an explicit emphasis on accessibility for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). Employing a case study of a university's computer science department, the paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based optimization model, which is solved using the Gurobi solver. The objective is to minimize the number of classrooms used by prioritizing the assignment of PwD students to ground-floor classrooms to reduce accessibility barriers. The model is calibrated with a weighting parameter, alpha, that allows for a balance between spatial efficiency and promoting accessibility. Experimental results indicate that adjusting alpha can achieve a balance point that significantly improves current manual allocation practices, reducing the number of classrooms required and accessibility penalties. The findings suggest that optimization methods can improve operational efficiency in academic institutions while promoting a more inclusive environment for all students. Future work may expand the application of the model to other departments and contexts and integrate additional criteria to develop a more holistic approach.

Abstract: Categorizing events using discriminant observables is central to many high-energy physics analyses. Yet, bin boundaries are often chosen by hand. A simple, popular choice is to apply argmax projections of multi-class scores and equidistant binning of one-dimensional discriminants. We propose a binning optimization for signal significance directly in multi-dimensional discriminants. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to define flexible bin boundary shapes for multi-class scores, while in one dimension (binary classification) we move bin boundaries directly. On this binning model, we study two optimization strategies: a differentiable and a Bayesian optimization approach. We study two toy setups: a binary classification and a three-class problem with two signals and backgrounds. In the one-dimensional case, both approaches achieve similar gains in signal sensitivity compared to equidistant binnings for a given number of bins. In the multi-dimensional case, the GMM-based binning defines sensitive categories as well, with the differentiable approach performing best. We show that, in particular for limited separability of the signal processes, our approach outperforms argmax classification even with optimized binning in the one-dimensional projections. Both methods are released as lightweight Python plugins intended for straightforward integration into existing analyses.

Motivation: 探讨人工智能降低劳动份额对工资的影响，回应这一重要社会经济担忧。

Method: 在规模报酬不变的竞争经济中进行理论证明，使用美国和其他11个工业化国家的数据进行估计。

Result: 劳动份额与工资呈非单调关系，12个国家劳动份额过高，进一步自动化应提高工资，1954 - 2019年美国劳动份额下降贡献16%实际工资增长。

Conclusion: 自动化驱动的劳动份额转变虽带来工资增长，但可能带来重大社会和政治挑战。

Abstract: A central socioeconomic concern about Artificial Intelligence is that it will lower wages by depressing the labor share - the fraction of economic output paid to labor. We show that declining labor share is more likely to raise wages. In a competitive economy with constant returns to scale, we prove that the wage-maximizing labor share depends only on the capital-to-labor ratio, implying a non-monotonic relationship between labor share and wages. When labor share exceeds this wage-maximizing level, further automation increases wages even while reducing labor's output share. Using data from the United States and eleven other industrialized countries, we estimate that labor share is too high in all twelve, implying that further automation should raise wages. Moreover, we find that falling labor share accounted for 16\% of U.S. real wage growth between 1954 and 2019. These wage gains notwithstanding, automation-driven shifts in labor share are likely to pose significant social and political challenges.

Method: 全面审查构建微观模拟模型的方法论选择，对71个国家的217个估计样本估计概率模型进行元分析。

Conclusion: 碳边境调节机制可能降低碳税累退性，不同建模选择会影响碳税分配影响的估计结果。

Abstract: Carbon taxes are increasingly popular among policymakers but remain politically contentious. A key challenge relates to their distributional impacts; the extent to which tax burdens differ across population groups. As a response, a growing number of studies analyse their distributional impact ex-ante, commonly relying on microsimulation models. However, distributional impact estimates differ across models due to differences in simulated tax designs, assumptions, modelled components, data sources, and outcome metrics. This study comprehensively reviews methodological choices made in constructing microsimulation models designed to simulate the impacts of carbon taxation and discusses how these choices affect the interpretation of results. It conducts a meta-analysis to assess the influence of modelling choices on distributional impact estimates by estimating a probit model on a sample of 217 estimates across 71 countries. The literature review highlights substantial diversity in modelling choices, with no standard practice emerging. The meta-analysis shows that studies modelling carbon taxes on imported emissions are significantly less likely to find regressive results, while indirect emission coverage has ambiguous effects on regressivity, suggesting that a carbon border adjustment mechanism may reduce carbon tax regressivity. Further, we find that estimates using older datasets, using explicit tax progressivity or income inequality measures, and accounting for household behaviour are associated with a lower likelihood of finding regressive estimates, while the inclusion of general equilibrium effects increases this likelihood.

Abstract: We explore the emergence of complex structures within reaction networks, focusing on nuclear reaction networks relevant to stellar nucleosynthesis. The work presents a theoretical framework rooted in Chemical Organization Theory (COT) to characterize how stable, self-sustaining structures arise from the interactions of basic components. Key theoretical contributions include the formalization of atom sets as fundamental reactive units and the concept of synergy to describe the emergence of new reactions and species from the interaction of these units. The property of separability is defined to distinguish dynamically coupled systems from those that can be decomposed. This framework is then applied to the STARLIB nuclear reaction network database, analyzing how network structure, particularly the formation and properties of atom sets and semi-self-maintaining sets, changes as a function of temperature. Results indicate that increasing temperature generally enhances network cohesion, leading to fewer, larger atom sets. Critical temperatures are identified where significant structural reorganizations occur, such as the merging of distinct clusters of atom sets and the disappearance of small, isolated reactive units. The analysis reveals core clusters - large (containing more that 1000 reactions), semi-self-maintaining structures that appear to form the core of all potentially stable nucleosynthetic configurations at various temperatures. Overall, the paper provides insights into the structural underpinnings of stability and emergence in complex reaction networks, with specific implications for understanding stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.

Abstract: We present a neural network-based method for learning scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. Our method replaces the traditional numerical flux in finite volume schemes with a trainable neural network while preserving the conservative structure of the scheme. The model can be trained both in a supervised setting with efficiently generated synthetic data or in an unsupervised manner, leveraging the weak formulation of the partial differential equation. We provide theoretical results that our model can perform arbitrarily well, and provide associated upper bounds on neural network size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method often outperforms efficient schemes such as Godunov's scheme, WENO, and Discontinuous Galerkin for comparable computational budgets. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a traffic prediction task, leveraging field experimental highway data from the Berkeley DeepDrive drone dataset.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of joint kinematics and kinetics is essential for advancing gait analysis and developing intelligent assistive systems such as prosthetics and exoskeletons. This study presents a hybrid LSTM-UKF framework for estimating ankle angle and ground reaction force (GRF) across varying walking speeds. A multimodal sensor fusion strategy integrates force plate data, knee angle, and GRF signals to enrich biomechanical context. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE and $R^2$ under subject-specific validation. The LSTM-UKF consistently outperformed standalone LSTM and UKF models, achieving up to 18.6\% lower RMSE for GRF prediction at 3 km/h. Additionally, UKF integration improved robustness, reducing ankle angle RMSE by up to 22.4\% compared to UKF alone at 1 km/h. These results underscore the effectiveness of hybrid architectures for reliable gait prediction across subjects and walking conditions.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.

Abstract: We introduce a principled learning to optimize (L2O) framework for solving fixed-point problems involving general nonexpansive mappings. Our idea is to deliberately inject summable perturbations into a standard Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration to improve its average-case performance over a specific distribution of problems while retaining its convergence guarantees. Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment several widely-used operator splitting methods to accelerate the solution of structured monotone inclusion problems, and validate our approach on a best approximation problem using an L2O-augmented Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm.
