### [1] [From Reasoning to Super-Intelligence: A Search-Theoretic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15865)
*Shai Shalev-Shwartz,Amnon Shashua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出CoT学习的核心障碍，提出Diligent Learner学习范式，证明其能有效从CoT数据学习，为构建大规模推理模型提供路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从CoT数据学习的理论基础不足，现有方法在复杂推理任务上表现不佳。

Method: 引入Diligent Learner学习范式，将推理建模为深度优先搜索，由验证器引导并支持失败回溯。

Result: 在两个温和且现实的假设下，证明Diligent Learner能有效从CoT数据学习，而现有方法不能。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于自然产生的不完整数据构建可扩展、可靠的推理系统，开发具有强大、可解释问题解决能力的大规模推理模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing
the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the
theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and
existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement
Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --
often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles
that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of
embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent
Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a
depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon
failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent
Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do
so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable
reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the
way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust,
interpretable problem-solving abilities.

### [2] [Re-evaluating Short- and Long-Term Trend Factors in CTA Replication: A Bayesian Graphical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15876)
*Eric Benhamou,Jean-Jacques Ohana,Alban Etienne,Béatrice Guez,Ethan Setrouk,Thomas Jacquot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文用贝叶斯图形模型将CTA回报动态分解为短期趋势、长期趋势和市场贝塔因子，并展示不同期限组合对策略风险调整后表现的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 趋势跟随策略中短期和长期趋势系统的相对优点和相互作用存在争议，需要进一步研究。

Method: 使用贝叶斯图形模型动态分解CTA回报。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论，但展示了不同期限组合对策略风险调整后表现的影响。

Abstract: Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have historically relied on trend-following
rules that operate on vastly different horizons from long-term breakouts that
capture major directional moves to short-term momentum signals that thrive in
fast-moving markets. Despite a large body of work on trend following, the
relative merits and interactions of short-versus long-term trend systems remain
controversial. This paper adds to the debate by (i) dynamically decomposing CTA
returns into short-term trend, long-term trend and market beta factors using a
Bayesian graphical model, and (ii) showing how the blend of horizons shapes the
strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

### [3] [Purchase and Production Optimization in a Meat Processing Plant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15866)
*Marek Vlk,Premysl Sucha,Jaroslaw Rudy,Radoslaw Idzikowski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对一家肉类加工公司的采购和材料加工优化问题，聚焦生产阶段，考虑特殊约束，设计基于整数线性规划的迭代方法求解，用真实数据验证算法能快速找到最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品生产行业尤其是肉类生产部门面临诸多挑战，有效利用投入材料对企业盈利至关重要，现有研究多关注供应链管理，本文聚焦生产阶段的优化问题。

Method: 设计基于整数线性规划的简单迭代方法，可使用开源整数线性规划求解器，能缓解商业求解器的数值问题。

Result: 使用肉类加工公司的真实数据表明，算法能在几秒内为所有考虑的用例找到最优解。

Conclusion: 所设计的基于整数线性规划的迭代方法能有效解决肉类加工公司生产阶段的优化问题，且能快速找到最优解。

Abstract: The food production industry, especially the meat production sector, faces
many challenges that have even escalated due to the recent outbreak of the
energy crisis in the European Union. Therefore, efficient use of input
materials is an essential aspect affecting the profit of such companies. This
paper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent
material processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the
majority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns
supply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The
problem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock
of material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely
neglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the
minimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints
makes the problem \mbox{$\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple
iterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve
real-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming
solver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical
issues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a
commercial solver. The results obtained using real data from the meat
processing company showed that our algorithm can find the optimum solution in a
few seconds for all considered use cases.

### [4] [Why Braking? Scenario Extraction and Reasoning Utilizing LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15874)
*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Vivek Subramanian,Ahmed Abouelazm,Robin Bohn,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出利用大语言模型（LLM）的场景理解和推理框架，解决从大量驾驶数据中识别安全关键的边缘情况的问题，实验表明该方法优于基于规则的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大量ADAS车辆产生的驾驶数据中，识别安全关键的边缘情况是挑战，现有基于规则的方法在复杂城市环境缺乏泛化性，研究车辆制动原因。

Method: 提出利用大语言模型（LLM）的场景理解和推理框架，实现低级别数值信号和自然语言描述的连接，提出双路径场景检索，支持已知场景基于类别的搜索和未知OOD场景基于嵌入的检索，并在Argoverse 2传感器数据集上进行场景标注。

Result: 方法优于基于规则的基线方法，对OOD场景有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提利用LLM的框架能有效解决驾驶数据中安全关键边缘情况的识别问题，在复杂场景有更好表现。

Abstract: The growing number of ADAS-equipped vehicles has led to a dramatic increase
in driving data, yet most of them capture routine driving behavior. Identifying
and understanding safety-critical corner cases within this vast dataset remains
a significant challenge. Braking events are particularly indicative of
potentially hazardous situations, motivating the central question of our
research: Why does a vehicle brake? Existing approaches primarily rely on
rule-based heuristics to retrieve target scenarios using predefined condition
filters. While effective in simple environments such as highways, these methods
lack generalization in complex urban settings. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) for scenario
understanding and reasoning. Our method bridges the gap between low-level
numerical signals and natural language descriptions, enabling LLM to interpret
and classify driving scenarios. We propose a dual-path scenario retrieval that
supports both category-based search for known scenarios and embedding-based
retrieval for unknown Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate
evaluation, we curate scenario annotations on the Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms rule-based baselines and
generalizes well to OOD scenarios.

### [5] [Differential Multimodal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15875)
*Jerry Li,Timothy Oh,Joseph Hoang,Vardhit Veeramachaneni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将文本模型的差分注意力机制扩展到文本 - 视觉模型PaliGemma，微调模型后证明该机制能提升信息检索和问答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型结合视觉等模态会加剧上下文窗口有限的挑战，Transformer注意力机制常过度关注无关上下文，需要解决信息检索噪声和幻觉问题。

Method: 将差分注意力机制扩展到PaliGemma模型，用LoRA微调PaliGemma 3B模型，并试验不同参数设置和配置。

Result: 差分注意力机制可适应并集成到现有模型微调中。

Conclusion: 差分注意力机制能增强嘈杂信息检索和问答能力。

Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their
efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional
modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context
windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer
attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In
this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed
for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to
evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce
hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA,
incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter
settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be
adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy
information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Generalization in the ARC-AGI Domain: Comparing Execution-Guided Neural Program Synthesis and Test-Time Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15877)
*Simon Ouellette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在ARC - AGI领域开展受控组合泛化实验，对比神经程序合成和测试时微调方法，发现执行引导的神经程序合成在组合新解决方案上表现更佳，TTFT成功在于激发大语言模型未能直接利用的分布内知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ARC - AGI领域研究不同方法的组合泛化能力，该领域要求具备分布外泛化能力才能成功。

Method: 在ARC - AGI领域进行受控组合泛化实验，对比神经程序合成和测试时微调方法。

Result: 执行引导的神经程序合成在组合新解决方案上优于所有参考算法，TTFT在ARC - AGI上的成功主要在于激发大语言模型未能直接利用的分布内知识。

Conclusion: 执行引导的神经程序合成在ARC - AGI领域组合新解决方案能力更强，TTFT可激发分布内知识。

Abstract: We run a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI
domain: an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize
out-of-distribution is, by design, an essential characteristic for success. We
compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this
experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms
all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our
empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly
in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on
directly.

### [7] [The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15880)
*Andy E. Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文引入递归一致性原则（RCP），定义功能智能模型（FMI）满足RCP，证明缺FMI系统会一致性崩溃，指出常见AI问题源于结构一致性丧失，影响AI对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂系统增长，需要确保推理过程结构一致性以实现有效扩展，解决常见AI问题。

Method: 引入RCP，形式化定义FMI，证明缺乏FMI的系统会出现递归一致性崩溃。

Result: 证明了缺乏FMI的系统在扩展时会出现递归一致性崩溃，指出常见AI问题是结构一致性丧失的症状。

Conclusion: RCP独特捕捉了连贯、可对齐智能所需的内部递归动态，倡导从行为约束转向结构一致性，为大规模安全通用、强一致性AI提供途径。

Abstract: Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural
coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex
systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures
semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle
(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order
N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic
coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator
that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this
coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system
can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We
formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known
operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,
composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,
adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions
(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving
semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any
system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it
scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and
instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other
foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics
needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under
recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift
from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for
safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.

### [8] [ADEPTS: A Capability Framework for Human-Centered Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15885)
*Pierluca D'Oro,Caley Drooff,Joy Chen,Joseph Tighe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前以人为中心的AI代理开发指导分散，缺乏面向用户的词汇，本文引入ADEPTS能力框架，为AI代理开发提供统一指导，有望加速改进用户相关能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推动AI代理发展，但当前以人为中心的AI代理开发指导分散，缺乏面向用户的简洁词汇描述代理核心能力。

Method: 基于以人为中心的代理设计六原则，引入ADEPTS能力框架，该框架位于技术和体验开发的接口。

Result: 提出ADEPTS能力框架，定义了一组面向用户的核心能力。

Conclusion: ADEPTS框架有潜力加速改进用户相关代理能力，简化体验设计，提供共享语言以跟踪和讨论AI代理开发进展。

Abstract: Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents,
assisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This
flexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and
cross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the
capabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current
guidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics
focus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal
pipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no
concise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should
fundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework
defining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance
around the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for
human-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities
an AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and
trustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and
taxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical
and experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex
AI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI
researchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe
ADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent
capabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those
capabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress
around the development of AI agents.

### [9] [Integrating Reason-Based Moral Decision-Making in the Reinforcement Learning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15895)
*Lisa Dargasz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨基于强化学习构建基于理由的人工道德智能体（RBAMAs），介绍其架构与特点，并展示初步实验潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主智能体向现实应用过渡，需满足伦理行为要求，构建人工道德智能体面临多方面挑战。

Method: 扩展强化学习架构，让智能体通过基于案例的反馈学习理由理论，实现基于规范推理的道德决策。

Result: 实现了RBAMA的首次应用，并在初步实验中展示了其潜力。

Conclusion: 扩展后的架构是开发满足关键伦理需求的人工道德智能体的具体可部署框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning methodology that has
demonstrated strong performance across a variety of tasks. In particular, it
plays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As
these agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly
approaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid
robots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes
to autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises
concerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the
requirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research
directed toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave
ethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a
range of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.
This study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents
(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning
architecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative
reasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn
a reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant
propositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They
are designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these
obligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute
to the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and
their moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a
concrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key
ethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and
demonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments.

### [10] [Agentic RAG with Knowledge Graphs for Complex Multi-Hop Reasoning in Real-World Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16507)
*Jean Lelong,Adnane Errazine,Annabelle Blangero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍用于探索INRAE科学数据的代理式RAG系统INRAExplorer，它能更好处理复杂查询，增强专业领域知识交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在复杂查询上表现不佳，在知识密集型领域存在关键差距，需要改进。

Method: 引入基于LLM的代理，采用多工具架构，通过从INRAE开放获取出版物得到的综合知识图谱动态访问知识库。

Result: INRAExplorer能进行迭代、有针对性的查询，检索详尽数据集，进行多跳推理，提供结构化、全面的答案。

Conclusion: INRAExplorer是增强专业领域知识交互的具体示例。

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering
limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or
navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in
knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system
for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research
Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an
LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich
knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open
access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct
iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all
publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver
structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete
illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.

Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in household environments,
especially in the form of proactive autonomous agents, brings about
possibilities of comfort and attention as well as it comes with intra or
extramural ethical challenges. This article analyzes agentic AI and its
applications, focusing on its move from reactive to proactive autonomy,
privacy, fairness and user control. We review responsible innovation
frameworks, human-centered design principles, and governance practices to
distill practical guidance for ethical smart home systems. Vulnerable user
groups such as elderly individuals, children, and neurodivergent who face
higher risks of surveillance, bias, and privacy risks were studied in detail in
context of Agentic AI. Design imperatives are highlighted such as tailored
explainability, granular consent mechanisms, and robust override controls,
supported by participatory and inclusive methodologies. It was also explored
how data-driven insights, including social media analysis via Natural Language
Processing(NLP), can inform specific user needs and ethical concerns. This
survey aims to provide both a conceptual foundation and suggestions for
developing transparent, inclusive, and trustworthy agentic AI in household
automation.

*Tong Wu,Chong Xiang,Jiachen T. Wang,Weichen Yu,Chawin Sitawarin,Vikash Sehwag,Prateek Mittal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究推理时间扩展对模型鲁棒性的影响，发现其效果依赖于对抗设置和部署环境，提醒从业者在安全敏感应用中权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理时间扩展在小尺度开源模型中的效果，以及揭示和检验先前工作中的隐含假设。

Method: 使用简单的预算强制策略研究小尺度开源模型，通过放松中间推理步骤隐藏的假设来识别安全风险。

Result: 小尺度开源模型可从推理时间扩展中受益；若中间推理步骤可访问，增加推理时间计算会降低模型鲁棒性；隐藏推理链的模型在某些场景仍易受攻击。

Conclusion: 推理时间扩展对模型鲁棒性的提升高度依赖于对抗设置和部署环境，从业者在安全敏感应用中需谨慎权衡。

Abstract: Recently, Zaremba et al. demonstrated that increasing inference-time
computation improves robustness in large proprietary reasoning LLMs. In this
paper, we first show that smaller-scale, open-source models (e.g., DeepSeek R1,
Qwen3, Phi-reasoning) can also benefit from inference-time scaling using a
simple budget forcing strategy. More importantly, we reveal and critically
examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are
hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important
security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse
scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,
increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.
Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning
chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated
reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively
demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend
heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context. We urge
practitioners to carefully weigh these subtle trade-offs before applying
inference-time scaling in security-sensitive, real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BikeMAN网络预测共享单车系统站点级自行车流量，实验显示其有高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享单车系统站点供需不平衡，此前虽有预测流量的努力，但站点级流量预测因时空复杂性和站点数量多而困难。

Method: 提出多级别时空注意力神经网络BikeMAN，由带注意力机制的编码器和解码器组成，分别表示站点特征空间相关性和流量时间特征。

Result: 通过对纽约市超1000万次骑行（超700个站点）实验，网络在预测该市所有站点自行车流量时显示出高准确性。

Conclusion: BikeMAN网络可有效用于预测整个共享单车系统的站点级自行车流量。

Abstract: Efficient use of urban micromobility resources such as bike sharing is
challenging due to the unbalanced station-level demand and supply, which causes
the maintenance of the bike sharing systems painstaking. Prior efforts have
been made on accurate prediction of bike traffics, i.e., demand/pick-up and
return/drop-off, to achieve system efficiency. However, bike station-level
traffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of
bike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike
sharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations.
To fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention
neural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing
systems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an
attention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of
bike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the
temporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on
over 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York
City, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic
of all stations in the city.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍统一框架对比经典计算与大语言模型（LLMs）的问题解决范式，定义问题空间，引入向量值信任指数Q和两个统计质量维度，助于理解LLMs时代问题解决特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典计算难以处理具有模糊性、动态环境和主观背景的人类问题，而LLMs可涉足该领域，因此需要统一框架理解和对比两种问题解决范式。

Method: 定义形式语言和自然语言可解决的问题空间，引入向量值信任指数Q，提出归一化双语义熵和情感效价两个统计质量维度。

Result: 明确了不同问题空间的解决方案评估方式，引入的信任指数和统计质量维度可区分不同范式的解决方案特性。

Conclusion: 文中概念有助于更严谨地理解LLMs时代问题解决的能力、局限性和本质。

Abstract: Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the
engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be
described with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean
of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,
and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language
Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to
engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This
paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these
problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces
addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the
former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter
requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking
into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural
language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects
solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions
from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language
solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality
dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual
diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.
Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable
metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts
introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the
capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前CLP扩展未研究子句体带否定的情况，希望统一多种扩展并增加表达能力。

Method: 使用近似不动点理论框架为程序提供语义，详细分析半环属性对语义的影响。

Result: 成功为允许子句体带否定的CLP扩展提供语义，并研究了半环属性的影响。

Conclusion: 提供了一个统一框架，涵盖现有方法并能用更具表达力的语言扩展。

Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a logic programming formalism used to
solve problems requiring the consideration of constraints, like resource
allocation and automated planning and scheduling. It has previously been
extended in various directions, for example to support fuzzy constraint
satisfaction, uncertainty, or negation, with different notions of semiring
being used as a unifying abstraction for these generalizations. None of these
extensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We
investigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and
allows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the
framework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the
impacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics. As such, we
provide a unifying framework that captures existing approaches and allows
extending them with a more expressive language.

Result: 成功识别、合成和表征三种新型锂离子电池阴极材料，容量较NMC811有显著提升。

Conclusion: ChatBattery为电池材料发明提供新途径，展示了AI驱动推理变革材料发现的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) techniques to
tackle complex problems, representing a transformative breakthrough in
artificial intelligence (AI). However, their reasoning capabilities have
primarily been demonstrated in solving math and coding problems, leaving their
potential for domain-specific applications-such as battery discovery-largely
unexplored. Inspired by the idea that reasoning mirrors a form of guided
search, we introduce ChatBattery, a novel agentic framework that integrates
domain knowledge to steer LLMs toward more effective reasoning in materials
design. Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and
characterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve
practical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over
the widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this
discovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and
reasoning-based platform for battery materials invention. This complete
AI-driven cycle-from design to synthesis to characterization-demonstrates the
transformative potential of AI-driven reasoning in revolutionizing materials
discovery.

Motivation: 评估模型计算美国个人所得税的能力。

Result: 最先进的模型在简化样本集上成功计算不到三分之一的联邦所得税申报表。

Conclusion: 模型存在滥用税表、计算错误和资格判定错误等问题，需要额外基础设施来应用大语言模型到个人所得税计算任务。

Abstract: Can AI file your taxes? Not yet. Calculating US personal income taxes is a
task that requires building an understanding of vast amounts of English text
and using that knowledge to carefully compute results. We propose TaxCalcBench,
a benchmark for determining models' abilities to calculate personal income tax
returns given all of the necessary information. Our experiment shows that
state-of-the-art models succeed in calculating less than a third of federal
income tax returns even on this simplified sample set. Our analysis concludes
that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and
incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for
additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于COPD诊断的AI模型缺乏诊断过程解释，大语言模型无法理解呼吸描记图，限制了临床信任和应用。

Method: 利用英国生物银行234,028名个体的数据，通过SpiroEncoder从呼吸曲线提取形态特征，用SpiroProjector在统一潜在空间中将其与肺功能测试数值对齐，让大语言模型生成综合诊断报告。

Result: SpiroLLM诊断AUROC为0.8980（95% CI: 0.8820 - 0.9132），在核心数据缺失的鲁棒性测试中，有效响应率达100%，远超仅文本模型的13.4%。

Conclusion: 生理信号与大语言模型深度融合有巨大潜力，为下一代可解释、可靠的临床决策支持工具建立了新范式。

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals
from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large
language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological
features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT
numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately
empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic
report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC
of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,
it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a
text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This
work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological
signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next
generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型的局限性，探索理论结构如何通过实践设计出现。

Method: 设计Agentic Flow架构，与基线大语言模型代理进行多步推理任务的对比实验。

Result: 结构化代理任务成功率达95.8%，基线系统为62.3%。

Conclusion: 实现可揭示认知理论潜在结构回声，不主张理论统一，PEACE提供理解架构的共享词汇。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a structural convergence across four influential
theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive
processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind-emerging
unintentionally within a practical AI agent architecture called Agentic Flow.
Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow
comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control,
Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally
inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively
aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including
predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.
  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with
baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent
achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while
the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed
at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may
emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.
  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures
design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new
theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures
shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a
position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface
latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical
unification.

Motivation: 解决阴影区LEO卫星能源短缺问题，同时考虑SAGIN节点通信和计算能耗，最大化长期能效。

Method: 提出SAGIN - MF - RIS架构，构建联合优化问题，采用CHIMERA框架，整合语义状态 - 动作压缩和参数共享。

Result: 仿真表明CHIMERA方案在能效上远超传统基准，SAGIN - MF - RIS架构因互补覆盖有优越能效表现。

Conclusion: 提出的架构和方案能有效提升SAGIN的能源效率。

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed,
empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS)
capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless
energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while
explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption
across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we
formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including
signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element
selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude
platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability.
The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed
discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid
intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and
parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore
suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the
proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks,
including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and
no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed
SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its
complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone
satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

Abstract: The integration of voice-based AI agents in healthcare presents a
transformative opportunity to bridge economic and accessibility gaps in digital
health delivery. This paper explores the role of large language model
(LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous
patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights
from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and
Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research,
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an
economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective
healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our
pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\%
expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over
traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time
conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy
compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding
regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that
AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency
but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare
executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for
routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to
prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing
current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory
frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for
equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM用于电路设计，其模型和数据需保护，现有TEE实现无法高效支持LLM资源密集特性。

Method: 在TEE、纯CPU、CPU - GPU混合三种环境构建实验，以每秒处理的token数评估性能，并用SoC设计任务测试台验证结果。

Result: 蒸馏模型性能好，适合资源受限设备；量化模型较FP16模型有最高3倍性能提升；少参数集下TDX在安全环境执行计算优于CPU版本。

Conclusion: 轻量级LLM可在资源受限系统高效部署用于半导体CAD应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks
and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained
models and their associated training data are considered confidential
intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential
Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations
are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.
In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a
TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel
Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three
environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and
evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.
  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other
models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for
resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit
quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain
of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer
parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms
the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We
further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.
These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying
lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD
applications.

Result: 在两个数据集上评估，在 C# 数据集上提升 44%，在 Java 数据集上提升 100%，优于最佳基线。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的协作框架在自动化提交解缠任务上有潜力。

Abstract: Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a
best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce
tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or
unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although
prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based,
have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish
between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones
(e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose
ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling
that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes.
ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a
multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies,
another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives
through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual
information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),
enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and
semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#
and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle
outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on
the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit
untangling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动翻译方法缺乏灵活性和可扩展性，先进语言模型受专有API实现限制，存在数据安全和依赖问题，需要更好的代码翻译方案。

Method: 提出ACT框架，其自动化管道可提升开源大语言模型性能；有合成数据生成模块构建数据集，结合单元测试保证功能准确和多样；评估框架含执行级检查；控制器模块动态管理整个流程。

Result: ACT能持续提升开源模型的有效性，应用于行业规模迁移项目可显著加速开发。

Conclusion: ACT为企业和开发者提供了安全可靠的代码翻译替代方案。

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration
projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and
enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated
translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which
often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models
present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based
implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this
paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative
framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling
in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's
automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,
narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of
closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation
module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code
samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.
ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a
comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its
controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting
hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based
on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to
continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the
process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the
effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a
secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation
pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in
developer acceleration.

Abstract: The emergence of deep research systems presents significant capabilities in
problem-solving, extending from basic queries to sophisticated research tasks.
However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these systems as agents for web
retrieval and report generation, overlooking their potential to discover novel
insights on the frontiers of scientific research. To address this gap, we
introduce ResearcherBench, the first benchmark focused on evaluating the
capabilities of these advanced, agentic systems - which we refer to as Deep AI
Research Systems (DARS) - on frontier AI scientific questions. We compiled a
dataset of 65 research questions expertly selected from real-world scientific
scenarios such as laboratory discussions and interviews, spanning 35 different
AI subjects and categorized into three types: technical details, literature
review, and open consulting. Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric
assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality,
with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and
coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and
baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep
Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in
open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step
toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI. We
open-source ResearcherBench to provide a standardized platform for promoting
the development of next-generation AI research assistants, hoping to foster a

Conclusion: 所提方法可有效解决多模态学习中知识转移问题，实现不同常用模态间的知识转移。

Abstract: Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or
efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the
model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer
and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited
access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning
by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a
student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via
distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely
differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce
a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained
loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can
easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we
propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature
level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a
quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified
data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on
speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that
our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the
commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.

Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型基准多反映高收入地区情况，在非洲部署有效性存疑，需评估其对非洲疾病和指南的适用性。

Method: 系统回顾31篇定量大语言模型评估论文，确定19个英语医学问答基准；开发Alama Health QA；对6个常用数据集进行语义分析和专家评分。

Result: Alama Health QA在所有语料中NTD提及率超40%，在疟疾、HIV和TB方面频率最高；全球基准对非洲疾病负担代表性不足；Alama在相关性和指南一致性方面得分最高，PubMedQA临床实用性最低。

Conclusion: 全球医学大语言模型基准可能误导性能评估，指南锚定、区域定制资源对非洲卫生系统安全、公平评估和部署模型至关重要。

Abstract: Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination
syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about
their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell
disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and
national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31
quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English
medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval
augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice
Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA,
MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized
semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity
metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance,
guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural
fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora
and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB
(5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global
benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in
three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for
relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.
Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature
underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking
misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources
such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential
for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health
systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces Higher Gauge Flow Models, a novel class of Generative
Flow Models. Building upon ordinary Gauge Flow Models (arXiv:2507.13414), these
Higher Gauge Flow Models leverage an L$_{\infty}$-algebra, effectively
extending the Lie Algebra. This expansion allows for the integration of the

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) programs utilize automated voice messages to deliver
health information, particularly targeting underserved communities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using mobile technology to disseminate
crucial health information to these populations, improving health outcomes
through increased awareness and behavioral change. India's Kilkari program
delivers vital maternal health information via weekly voice calls to millions
of mothers. However, the current random call scheduling often results in missed
calls and reduced message delivery. This study presents a field trial of a
collaborative bandit algorithm designed to optimize call timing by learning
individual mothers' preferred call times. We deployed the algorithm with around
$6500$ Kilkari participants as a pilot study, comparing its performance to the
baseline random calling approach. Our results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in call pick-up rates with the bandit algorithm,
indicating its potential to enhance message delivery and impact millions of
mothers across India. This research highlights the efficacy of personalized
scheduling in mobile health interventions and underscores the potential of
machine learning to improve maternal health outreach at scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出在Pearl因果框架的马尔可夫设定下，用反事实模型形式化和实现反事实信念的替代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 很多反事实陈述无法被证伪，但支撑如个体公平等基本概念，因此为形式化和实现反事实信念提供模型是基础科学问题。

Method: 提出反事实模型，即结构因果模型的规范表示，通过带预设边际的随机过程概率分布选择反事实概念；给出归一化程序描述和实现不同反事实概念。

Result: 相比结构因果模型，能在不改变观测和干预约束下指定多种反事实概念，且无需估计反事实层对应模型内容，只需做选择。

Conclusion: 通过理论和数值例子说明了反事实在因果关系中的特定作用和所提方法的益处。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like
''Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the
most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual
statements cannot be falsified -- even by randomized experiments -- they
underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore,
providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a
fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal
framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to
represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More
precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical
representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a
counterfactual conception via random-process probability distributions with
preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of
structural causal models. Then, we present a normalization procedure to
describe and implement various counterfactual conceptions. Compared to
structural causal models, it allows to specify many counterfactual conceptions
without altering the observational and interventional constraints. Moreover,
the content of the model corresponding to the counterfactual layer does not
need to be estimated; only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the
specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach
on theoretical and numerical examples.

Result: Poker性能随自动生成示例增加而提升，Louise因缺乏负例过泛化。

Conclusion: 新的自监督ILP设置和Poker算法有效，新的二阶背景理论选择方法可去除针对特定学习任务定制背景理论的需求。

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approaches like Meta \-/ Interpretive
Learning (MIL) can learn, from few examples, recursive logic programs with
invented predicates that generalise well to unseen instances. This ability
relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected
with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such
a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We
formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a
new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled,
and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels,
new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm
in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to
state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for
Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no
negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in
examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for
the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order
Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a
class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning
task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of
automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples,
over-generalises.

Method: 提出NA - PDD算法，分析大语言模型中训练和非训练数据的神经元激活模式差异；引入CCNewsPDD基准，采用严格数据转换确保训练和非训练数据时间分布一致。

Result: 实验表明NA - PDD在三个基准和多个大语言模型上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NA - PDD算法在大语言模型的预训练数据检测任务中表现出色，具有应用价值。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their
training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information,
raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for
dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the
Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific
data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD
methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss,
resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a
novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between
training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that
these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also
introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data
transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and
non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly
outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: 求解器和控制器在解决问题能力上等价。

Abstract: A "model" is a theory that describes the state of an environment and the
effects of an agent's decisions on the environment. A model-based agent can use
its model to predict the effects of its future actions and so plan ahead, but
must know the state of the environment. A model-free agent cannot plan, but can
act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An
autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must
combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with
Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a
model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver.
We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on
grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes,
and lake maps with wide open areas. We find that all navigation problems solved
by the Solver are also solved by the Controller, indicating the two are
equivalent.

Abstract: The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem deals with the optimization of
daily operating room surgery schedules. It is a challenging problem subject to
many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries
and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in
different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer
Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall
satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify
whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest
alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is
not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the
resulting schedules are not always robust.
  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving
these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the
surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then,
we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our
problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust
schedules. Results on historical data from the ASL1 Liguria in Italy confirm
the viability of our integration.

Result: 在复杂逻辑推理基准和运动任务中取得良好表现。

Conclusion: 该框架是学习语言和控制抽象技能的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step
textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this,
we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the
model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every
step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as
temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of
options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian
Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference
within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these
options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP
homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract
latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the
solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start
procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human
reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich
initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical
reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework
as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and
control.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

Abstract: Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly
lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations,
and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges
can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search
space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for
large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also
be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive
cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial
assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing
assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most
existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment
for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and
resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper
proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which
ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training
time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed
by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced.
A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted,
offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly
lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently
provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network
that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating
significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a
comparable model-based approach.

Conclusion: 研究结果对政策制定者在不确定情况下更有效管理农产品库存有管理意义。

Abstract: Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in
production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to
these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or
stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level
of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To
bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of
agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing
effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit
throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases
due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes
challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of
solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL
approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed
algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their
interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing
profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,
and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with
continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the
inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the
empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is
considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the
proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and
lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for
policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively
under uncertainty.

Conclusion: wgrammar有效解决了现有结构化解码方法的效率问题，其代码开源。

Abstract: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs
in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However,
existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation,
state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed
strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a
decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling
static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using
grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a
compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower
transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that
integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask
caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source
code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

Motivation: 现代对话系统实现超越纯大语言模型交互，需对其整体进行测试评估，但现有工作多关注回合级分析，缺乏对话级质量保证。

Result: ChatChecker减少了设置工作，具有可泛化性，能更有效地发现目标对话系统的弱点。

Conclusion: ChatChecker有助于全面且可扩展的测试，能加速健壮对话系统的开发。

Abstract: While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs),
their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers
integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment
of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be
tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With
most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been
paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we
present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of
complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user
interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to
previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as
it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the
implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection
performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in
the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator
based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue
systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and
scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate
the development of robust dialogue systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading
that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast
to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach
employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model
called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify
prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the
stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages
domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that
ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each
prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL
framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear
understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the
uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to
5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing
electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak
hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These
improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting
the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,
economically efficient energy communities.

Abstract: Learning-based surrogate models have become a practical alternative to
high-fidelity CFD solvers, but their latent representations remain opaque and
hinder adoption in safety-critical or regulation-bound settings. This work
introduces a posthoc interpretability framework for graph-based surrogate
models used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). By obtaining an overcomplete basis in the node embedding
space of a pretrained surrogate, the method extracts a dictionary of
interpretable latent features. The approach enables the identification of
monosemantic concepts aligned with physical phenomena such as vorticity or flow
structures, offering a model-agnostic pathway to enhance explainability and
trustworthiness in CFD applications.

Result: 设计药物的释放曲线与目标曲线接近，基于SROM的药物设计释放曲线不确定性更小。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种可靠的考虑不确定性的药物设计方法。

Abstract: Effective disease treatment often requires precise control of the release of
the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In this work, we present a
computational inverse design approach to determine the optimal drug composition
that yields a target release profile. We assume that the drug release is
governed by the Noyes-Whitney model, meaning that dissolution occurs at the
surface of the drug. Our inverse design method is based on topology
optimization. The method optimizes the drug composition based on the target
release profile, considering the drug material parameters and the shape of the
final drug. Our method is non-parametric and applicable to arbitrary drug
shapes. The inverse design method is complemented by robust topology
optimization, which accounts for the random drug material parameters. We use
the stochastic reduced-order method (SROM) to propagate the uncertainty in the
dissolution model. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, SROM requires fewer samples and
improves computational performance. We apply our method to designing drugs with
several target release profiles. The numerical results indicate that the
release profiles of the designed drugs closely resemble the target profiles.
The SROM-based drug designs exhibit less uncertainty in their release profiles,
suggesting that our method is a convincing approach for uncertainty-aware drug
design.

Motivation: 传统投资组合优化方法在复杂约束、大数据集和多目标场景下可扩展性和灵活性不足。

Method: 引入基于梯度下降和自动微分的多目标投资组合优化基准框架，支持多种优化目标和现实约束。

Result: 在六个实验场景中评估，与标准求解器对比，该方法表现有竞争力，且建模多目标和约束更灵活。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to portfolio optimization, often rooted in Modern
Portfolio Theory and solved via quadratic programming or evolutionary
algorithms, struggle with scalability or flexibility, especially in scenarios
involving complex constraints, large datasets and/or multiple conflicting
objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce a benchmark framework for
multi-objective portfolio optimization (MPO) using gradient descent with
automatic differentiation. Our method supports any optimization objective, such
as minimizing risk measures (e.g., CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratio, along with
realistic constraints, such as tracking error limits, UCITS regulations, or
asset group restrictions. We have evaluated our framework across six
experimental scenarios, from single-objective setups to complex multi-objective
cases, and have compared its performance against standard solvers like CVXPY
and SKFOLIO. Our results show that our method achieves competitive performance
while offering enhanced flexibility for modeling multiple objectives and
constraints. We aim to provide a practical and extensible tool for researchers
and practitioners exploring advanced portfolio optimization problems in
real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 介绍AcceleratedKernels.jl库用于Julia并行计算，具多加速器支持、性能好、可组合性强等优点，测试有高吞吐量，GPU使用NVLink有加速效果及经济考量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一个后端无关的Julia并行计算库，减少实现和使用复杂性，提高并行编程效率。

Method: 采用独特的转译架构，以统一紧凑代码库编写，对算术密集型内核进行基准测试，在HPC集群上测试等。

Result: 算术密集型内核性能与C和OpenMP多线程CPU实现相当，Julia数值性能有时更优；实现CPU - GPU协同处理；在HPC集群测试有高排序吞吐量；使用NVLink有平均4.93倍加速。

Conclusion: AcceleratedKernels.jl库可实现高效并行计算，对于通信密集型HPC任务，使用GPUDirect互连的GPU在经济上才可行。

Abstract: AcceleratedKernels.jl is introduced as a backend-agnostic library for
parallel computing in Julia, natively targeting NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple
accelerators via a unique transpilation architecture. Written in a unified,
compact codebase, it enables productive parallel programming with minimised
implementation and usage complexities. Benchmarks of arithmetic-heavy kernels
show performance on par with C and OpenMP-multithreaded CPU implementations,
with Julia sometimes offering more consistent and predictable numerical
performance than conventional C compilers. Exceptional composability is
highlighted as simultaneous CPU-GPU co-processing is achievable - such as
CPU-GPU co-sorting - with transparent use of hardware-specialised MPI
implementations. Tests on the Baskerville Tier 2 UK HPC cluster achieved
world-class sorting throughputs of 538-855 GB/s using 200 NVIDIA A100 GPUs,
comparable to the highest literature-reported figure of 900 GB/s achieved on
262,144 CPU cores. The use of direct NVLink GPU-to-GPU interconnects resulted
in a 4.93x speedup on average; normalised by a combined capital, running and
environmental cost, communication-heavy HPC tasks only become economically
viable on GPUs if GPUDirect interconnects are employed.

Abstract: Kubernetes has emerged as an essential platform for deploying containerised
applications across cloud and edge infrastructures. As Kubernetes gains
increasing adoption for mission-critical microservices, evaluating system
resilience under realistic fault conditions becomes crucial. However,
systematic resilience assessments of Kubernetes in hybrid cloud-edge
environments are currently limited in research. To address this gap, a novel
resilience evaluation framework integrates mainstream fault injection tools
with automated workload generation for comprehensive cloud-edge Kubernetes
testing. Multiple fault injection platforms, including Chaos Mesh, Gremlin, and
ChaosBlade are combined with realistic traffic simulation tools, enabling
automated orchestration of complex failure scenarios. Through this framework,
comprehensive experiments are conducted that systematically target node-level,
pod-level, and network failures across cloud and cloud-edge environments. The
first comprehensive resilience dataset for hybrid cloud-edge Kubernetes
deployments is created, comprising over 30 GB of performance data from 11,965
fault injection scenarios including response times, failure rates, and error
patterns. Analysis reveals that cloud-edge deployments demonstrate 80% superior
response stability under network delay and partition conditions, while cloud
deployments exhibit 47% better resilience under bandwidth limitations,
providing quantitative guidance for architectural decision-making in cloud-edge
deployments.

Abstract: Blockchain systems have been a part of mainstream academic research, and a
hot topic at that. It has spread to almost every subfield in the computer
science literature, as well as economics and finance. Especially in a world
where digital trust is much sought for, blockchains offer a rich variety of
desired properties, such as immutability, public auditing, decentralised record
keeping, among others. Not only has it been a research topic of its own, the
integration of blockchains into other systems has been proposed as solutions in
many areas, ranging from grid computing, cloud and fog computing, to internet
of things, self driving vehicles , and smart cities. In many cases the primary
function attributed to blockchains in these contexts is resource management.
Although much attention is paid to this topic, the focus is on single resource
allocation scenarios. Even the cases where multiple resource types are to be
allocated, are treated as single resource type scenarios, and problems are
formulated as allocating standardised bundles consisting of a fixed amount of
each of them, such as virtual machines. The present study addresses the problem
of allocating multiple resource types among tasks with heterogeneous resource
demands with a smart contract adaptation of Precomputed Dominant Resource
Fairness; an algorithm that approximates Dominant Resource Fairness, without
loop iterations, which makes it preferable in the blockchain context because of
the block gas limit. We present the resulting algorithm, Autonomous Dominant
Resource Fairness, along with the empirical data collected from the tests run
on the algorithm. The results show that Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness
is a gas-cost efficient algorithm, which can be used to manage hundreds of
resource types for unlimited number of users.

Conclusion: FOGNITE将电网控制从被动修正转向主动优化，迈向更智能、自适应和可持续能源基础设施。

Abstract: Modern smart grids demand fast, intelligent, and energy-aware computing at
the edge to manage real time fluctuations and ensure reliable operation. This
paper introduces FOGNITE Fog-based Grid In intelligence with Neural Integration
and Twin based Execution a next-generation fog cloud framework designed to
enhance autonomy, resilience, and efficiency in distributed energy systems.
FOGNITE combines three core components: federated learning, reinforcement
learning, and digital twin validation. Each fog node trains a local CNN LSTM
model on private energy consumption data, enabling predictive intelligence
while preserving data privacy through federated aggregation. A reinforcement
learning agent dynamically schedules tasks based on current system load and
energy conditions, optimizing for performance under uncertainty.
  To prevent unsafe or inefficient decisions, a hierarchical digital twin layer
simulates potential actions before deployment, significantly reducing execution
errors and energy waste. We evaluate FOGNITE on a real world testbed of
Raspberry Pi devices, showing up to a 93.7% improvement in load balancing
accuracy and a 63.2% reduction in energy waste compared to conventional
architectures. By shifting smart grid control from reactive correction to
proactive optimization, FOGNITE represents a step toward more intelligent,
adaptive, and sustainable energy infrastructures

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, deploying them solely in the cloud or
compressing them for edge devices has become inadequate due to concerns about
latency, privacy, cost, and personalization. This survey explores a
collaborative paradigm in which cloud-based LLMs and edge-deployed small
language models (SLMs) cooperate across both inference and training. We present
a unified taxonomy of edge-cloud collaboration strategies. For inference, we
categorize approaches into task assignment, task division, and mixture-based
collaboration at both task and token granularity, encompassing adaptive
scheduling, resource-aware offloading, speculative decoding, and modular
routing. For training, we review distributed adaptation techniques, including
parameter alignment, pruning, bidirectional distillation, and
small-model-guided optimization. We further summarize datasets, benchmarks, and
deployment cases, and highlight privacy-preserving methods and vertical
applications. This survey provides the first systematic foundation for LLM-SLM
collaboration, bridging system and algorithm co-design to enable efficient,
scalable, and trustworthy edge-cloud intelligence.

Abstract: The unprecedented growth in artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, recently
dominated by large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs),
has intensified power and cooling demands in data centers. This study
benchmarks LLMs and VLMs on two HGX nodes, each with 8x NVIDIA H100 graphics

Weights and Biases, and IPMItool, we collect detailed thermal, power, and
computation data. Results show that the liquid-cooled systems maintain GPU
temperatures between 41-50 degrees Celsius, while the air-cooled counterparts
fluctuate between 54-72 degrees Celsius under load. This thermal stability of
liquid-cooled systems yields 17 percent higher performance (54 TFLOPs per GPU
vs. 46 TFLOPs per GPU), improved performance per watt, reduced energy overhead,
and greater system efficiency than the air-cooled counterparts. These findings
underscore the energy and sustainability benefits of liquid cooling, offering a
compelling path forward for hyperscale data centers s

Motivation: 现有在线随机组合优化工作假设输入独立或任意相关存在不足，需研究中间模型。

Method: 针对最小化问题将其归约到p - 样本模型，针对最大化问题将“平衡价格”框架扩展到MRFs。

Result: 提出通用技术，在MRF分布输入下针对最小化和最大化问题实现O(Δ)竞争比算法。

Conclusion: 可以在马尔可夫随机场下为组合优化问题设计出具有一定竞争比的算法。

Abstract: Most existing work in online stochastic combinatorial optimization assumes
that inputs are drawn from independent distributions -- a strong assumption
that often fails in practice. At the other extreme, arbitrary correlations are
equivalent to worst-case inputs via Yao's minimax principle, making good
algorithms often impossible. This motivates the study of intermediate models
that capture mild correlations while still permitting non-trivial algorithms.
  In this paper, we study online combinatorial optimization under Markov Random
Fields (MRFs), a well-established graphical model for structured dependencies.
MRFs parameterize correlation strength via the maximum weighted degree
$\Delta$, smoothly interpolating between independence ($\Delta = 0$) and full
correlation ($\Delta \to \infty$). While na\"ively this yields
$e^{O(\Delta)}$-competitive algorithms and $\Omega(\Delta)$ hardness, we ask:
when can we design tight $\Theta(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms?
  We present general techniques achieving $O(\Delta)$-competitive algorithms
for both minimization and maximization problems under MRF-distributed inputs.
For minimization problems with coverage constraints (e.g., Facility Location
and Steiner Tree), we reduce to the well-studied $p$-sample model. For
maximization problems (e.g., matchings and combinatorial auctions with XOS
buyers), we extend the "balanced prices" framework for online allocation
problems to MRFs.

Motivation: Moseley等人留下为任意函数设计常数竞争算法的开放问题，且他们的算法不适用于任意（请求依赖）持有成本和积压成本函数。

Method: 设计具有动态优先级的算法，服务请求的一般子集而非按截止日期的前缀。

Result: 为单物品情况建立4 - 竞争算法，为一般（多物品）版本建立16 - 竞争算法。

Conclusion: 成功解决开放问题，设计出适用于任意请求依赖函数的常数竞争算法。

Abstract: In their seminal paper Moseley, Niaparast, and Ravi introduced the Joint
Replenishment Problem (JRP) with holding and backlog costs that models the
trade-off between ordering costs, holding costs, and backlog costs in supply
chain planning systems. Their model generalized the classical the make-to-order
version as well make-to-stock version. For the case where holding costs
function of all items are the same and all backlog costs are the same, they
provide a constant competitive algorithm, leaving designing a constant
competitive algorithm for arbitrary functions open. Moreover, they noticed that
their algorithm does not work for arbitrary (request dependent) holding costs
and backlog costs functions. We resolve their open problem and design a
constant competitive algorithm that works for arbitrary request dependent
functions. Specifically, we establish a 4-competitive algorithm for the
single-item case and a 16-competitive for the general (multi-item) version. The
algorithm of Moseley, Niaparast, and Ravi is based on fixed priority on the
requests to items, and request to an item are always served by order of
deadlines. In contrast, we design an algorithm with dynamic priority over the
requests such that instead of servicing a prefix by deadline of requests, we
may need to service a general subset of the requests.

Motivation: 现有缓存算法在鲁棒性保证和1 - 一致性上存在不足，如朴素学习增强缓存算法缺乏鲁棒性保证，现有鲁棒化方法会牺牲1 - 一致性或引入大量计算开销。

Method: 引入轻量级鲁棒化框架Guard，增强学习增强缓存算法的鲁棒性至2H_k + 2，同时保留1 - 一致性。

Conclusion: 通过多个真实数据集和预测模型的大量实验，验证了Guard在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a
sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented
caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness
guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency
or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce
\textsc{Guard}, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the
robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k +
2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. \textsc{Guard} achieves the current
best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the
original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across
multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness
of \textsc{Guard} in practice.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A border of a string is a non-empty proper prefix of the string that is also
a suffix. A string is unbordered if it has no border. The longest unbordered
factor is a fundamental notion in stringology, closely related to string
periodicity. This paper addresses the longest unbordered factor problem: given
a string of length $n$, the goal is to compute its longest factor that is
unbordered. While recent work has achieved subquadratic and near-linear time
algorithms for this problem, the best known worst-case time complexity remains
$O(n \log n)$ [Kociumaka et al., ISAAC 2018]. In this paper, we investigate the
problem in the context of compressed string processing, particularly focusing
on run-length encoded (RLE) strings. We first present a simple yet crucial
structural observation relating unbordered factors and RLE-compressed strings.
Building on this, we propose an algorithm that solves the problem in $O(m^{1.5}
\log^2 m)$ time and $O(m \log^2 m)$ space, where $m$ is the size of the
RLE-compressed input string. To achieve this, our approach simulates a key idea
from the $O(n^{1.5})$-time algorithm by [Gawrychowski et al., SPIRE 2015],
adapting it to the RLE setting through new combinatorial insights. When the RLE
size $m$ is sufficiently small compared to $n$, our algorithm may show
linear-time behavior in $n$, potentially leading to improved performance over
existing methods in such cases.

Conclusion: 在不同估值类型下，可在一定程度上平衡事前和事后公平保障，通过不同策略实现不同强度的公平分配。

Abstract: Fair allocation of indivisible goods is a fundamental problem at the
interface of economics and computer science. Traditional approaches focus
either on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic
allocations that are approximately fair. Recent work reconciles both these
approaches via best-of-both-worlds guarantees, wherein one seeks randomized
allocations that are fair in expectation (ex-ante fair) while being supported
on approximately fair allocations (ex-post fair). Prior work has shown that
under additive valuations, there always exists a randomized allocation that is
ex-ante stochastic-dominance envy-free (sd-EF) and ex-post envy-free up to one
good (EF1).
  Our work is motivated by the goal of achieving stronger ex-post fairness
guarantees such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) along with meaningful
ex-ante guarantees. We make the following contributions:
  1) We first consider lexicographic preferences, a subdomain of additive
valuations where ex-post EFX allocations always exist and can be computed
efficiently. On the negative side, we show that ex-ante sd-EF is fundamentally
incompatible with ex-post EFX, prompting a relaxation of the ex-ante benchmark.
We then present a poly. time algorithm that achieves ex-post EFX and PO
together with ex-ante 9/10-EF. Our algorithm uses dependent rounding and
leverages structural properties of EFX and PO allocations.
  2)For monotone valuations, we study EFX-with-charity: a relaxation of EFX
where some goods remain unallocated, with no agent envying the unallocated
pool. We show that ex-post EFX-with-charity can be achieved alongside ex-ante
0.5-EF.
  3)Finally, for subadditive valuations, we strengthen our previous ex-post
guarantee to EFX-with-bounded-charity, where at most n-1 goods (n= no. of
agents) remain unallocated, at the price of weakening the ex-ante guarantee to
0.5-proportionality.

### [59] [Scaling Recommender Transformers to One Billion Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15994)
*Kirill Khrylchenko,Artem Matveev,Sergei Makeev,Vladimir Baikalov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出训练高达十亿参数的大型变压器推荐器的方法，在音乐平台部署后提升推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型变压器模型在推荐系统中的扩展仍是难题，现有生成式推荐框架参数规模较小。

Method: 将用户历史的自回归学习分解为反馈预测和下一项预测两个子任务。

Result: 在大型音乐平台成功部署，在线A/B测试显示总收听时间增加2.26%，用户点赞可能性提高6.37%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效扩展不同规模变压器，显著提升推荐系统质量。

Abstract: While large transformer models have been successfully used in many real-world
applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech
processing, scaling transformers for recommender systems remains a challenging
problem. Recently, Generative Recommenders framework was proposed to scale
beyond typical Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). Reformulation of
recommendation as sequential transduction task led to improvement of scaling
properties in terms of compute. Nevertheless, the largest encoder configuration
reported by the HSTU authors amounts only to ~176 million parameters, which is
considerably smaller than the hundreds of billions or even trillions of
parameters common in modern language models.
  In this work, we present a recipe for training large transformer recommenders
with up to a billion parameters. We show that autoregressive learning on user
histories naturally decomposes into two subtasks, feedback prediction and
next-item prediction, and demonstrate that such a decomposition scales
effectively across a wide range of transformer sizes. Furthermore, we report a
successful deployment of our proposed architecture on a large-scale music
platform serving millions of users. According to our online A/B tests, this new
model increases total listening time by +2.26% and raises the likelihood of
user likes by +6.37%, constituting (to our knowledge) the largest improvement
in recommendation quality reported for any deep learning-based system in the
platform's history.

### [60] [LLM-Enhanced Reranking for Complementary Product Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16237)
*Zekun Xu,Yudi Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出用大语言模型增强互补产品推荐重排序的方法，实验表明能有效平衡准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法在互补产品推荐中难以平衡准确性和多样性，尤其是对长尾商品。

Method: 采用与模型无关的方法，利用大语言模型的提示策略直接对现有推荐模型检索出的候选商品进行重排序，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在公共数据集上实验，该方法能有效平衡准确性和多样性，前推荐商品的准确性指标平均提升至少50%，多样性指标平均提升2%。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的提示策略可有效提升互补产品推荐的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are
used together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in
e-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made
significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often
struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail
items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product
recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data
preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting
strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing
recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through
extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach
effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product
recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in
diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文引入强化学习提出RLIV - UA模型提升用户 - 作者对的终身交互价值，实验显示该模型优于对比方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数推荐系统研究忽略作者影响和用户 - 作者对的终身交互价值，而这对短视频平台社交社区繁荣很关键，需优化。

Method: 引入强化学习构建RLIV - UA模型；提出SCRI - MDP和ASA方法构建训练样本；采用MTCL捕捉交互渐进性；设计辅助监督学习任务增强模型收敛。

Result: 在离线实验和在线A/B测试中，RLIV - UA模型实现了更高的用户满意度和平台利润。

Conclusion: RLIV - UA模型在提升用户 - 作者对的终身交互价值上效果良好，优于对比方法。

Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) help users find interested content and connect
authors with their target audience. Most research in RS tends to focus either
on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or
improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for
authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is
particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in
short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize
long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we
introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs
(RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals
between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel
Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and
introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training
samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to
capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift),
where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning
of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to
enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online
A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher
platform profits than compared methods.

TL;DR: 现有顺序推荐系统评估协议不足，本文对比不同分割策略，发现流行分割策略与现实评估策略可能不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有顺序推荐系统的评估协议发展不足，不能准确反映推荐任务或与现实场景不符。

Method: 在多个数据集和既定基线模型上系统比较顺序推荐的不同分割策略。

Result: 评估结果因分割策略而异，会影响模型排名和实际部署决策，流行的分割策略如留一法可能与更现实的评估策略不一致。

Conclusion: 为提高学术和工业环境中的可重复性，应关注分割策略与现实评估策略的匹配度。

Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems, ranging from lightweight
transformer-based variants to large language models, have become increasingly
prominent in academia and industry due to their strong performance in the
next-item prediction task. Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential
recommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the
corresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with
real-world scenarios.
  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it
permits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal
leakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance.
Global temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct
future periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain
loosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and
constructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between
validation and test metrics.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly
across splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical
deployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and
industrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies
for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established
baselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may
be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies. Code:

TL;DR: 本文探讨在专利检索中应用提取式和抽象式摘要方法生成专利文档摘要作替代查询，实验表明基于摘要的查询能显著提升检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效查询表述是长文档信息检索的关键挑战，在专利检索等特定领域尤为突出，需更好的查询方法。

Method: 应用提取式和抽象式摘要方法生成专利文档摘要，将其作为替代查询，并在三个基准专利数据集上评估其效用。

Result: 基于摘要的查询显著提高了现有技术检索的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于摘要的查询有潜力成为传统查询表述技术的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Effective query formulation is a key challenge in long-document Information
Retrieval (IR). This challenge is particularly acute in domain-specific
contexts like patent retrieval, where documents are lengthy, linguistically
complex, and encompass multiple interrelated technical topics. In this work, we
present the application of recent extractive and abstractive summarization
methods for generating concise, purpose-specific summaries of patent documents.
We further assess the utility of these automatically generated summaries as
surrogate queries across three benchmark patent datasets and compare their
retrieval performance against conventional approaches that use entire patent
sections. Experimental results show that summarization-based queries
significantly improve prior-art retrieval effectiveness, highlighting their
potential as an efficient alternative to traditional query formulation
techniques.

TL;DR: 研究利用大语言模型为搜索结果生成解释，结果优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在为搜索结果生成解释方面的潜力未被探索，弥补此空白。

Method: 利用编码器 - 解码器和仅解码器的大语言模型为搜索结果生成解释。

Result: 生成的解释比一系列基线模型产生的解释更准确、更合理。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可有效用于为搜索结果生成高质量解释。

Abstract: Aspect-oriented explanations in search results are typically concise text
snippets placed alongside retrieved documents to serve as explanations that
assist users in efficiently locating relevant information. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance for a range of
problems, their potential to generate explanations for search results has not
been explored. This study addresses that gap by leveraging both encoder-decoder
and decoder-only LLMs to generate explanations for search results. The
explanations generated are consistently more accurate and plausible
explanations than those produced by a range of baseline models.

Motivation: 不清楚用户是否认为自然语言用户品味档案准确代表其品味，且档案质量可能因用户和项目特征存在系统差异。

Method: 进行用户研究，让参与者对根据自己听歌历史生成的自然语言档案评分，分析用户属性和项目特征对认同档案的影响，并与下游推荐任务中的模式比较。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 强调基于大语言模型的可审查式分析在个性化系统中的潜力与局限。

Abstract: One particularly promising use case of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
recommendation is the automatic generation of Natural Language (NL) user taste
profiles from consumption data. These profiles offer interpretable and editable
alternatives to opaque collaborative filtering representations, enabling
greater transparency and user control. However, it remains unclear whether
users consider these profiles to be an accurate representation of their taste,
which is crucial for trust and usability. Moreover, because LLMs inherit
societal and data-driven biases, profile quality may systematically vary across
user and item characteristics. In this paper, we study this issue in the
context of music streaming, where personalization is challenged by a large and
culturally diverse catalog. We conduct a user study in which participants rate
NL profiles generated from their own listening histories. We analyze whether
identification with the profiles is biased by user attributes (e.g.,
mainstreamness, taste diversity) and item features (e.g., genre, country of
origin). We also compare these patterns to those observed when using the
profiles in a downstream recommendation task. Our findings highlight both the
potential and limitations of scrutable, LLM-based profiling in personalized
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出综合申请人档案评分（CAPS）框架，用于定量建模和解读大学招生评估，实验表现良好，可解决传统评估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统整体招生评估中不透明、不一致以及给申请人带来焦虑等关键局限，实现更公平和基于数据的招生实践。

Method: 将申请人档案分解为学术表现、论文质量和课外活动参与度三个可解释部分，利用基于变压器的语义嵌入、大语言模型评分和XGBoost回归进行评估。

Result: 在合成但现实的数据集上实验表现出色，EQI预测R^2为0.80，分类准确率超75%，宏F1分数为0.69，加权F1分数为0.74。

Conclusion: CAPS框架可解决传统整体评估的问题，为更公平和基于数据的招生实践铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a
novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret
holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles
into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized
Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and
extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging
transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression,
CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human
judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong
performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy
over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74. CAPS
addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the
opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way
for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ICD编码系统无法在EHR中捕捉罕见病信息，现有方法存在处理缩写、隐式疾病提及、隐私和临床推理能力等问题。

Method: 提出RDMA框架，模拟医学专家识别EHR中罕见病模式，连接分散临床观察，处理缩写、识别隐式模式并进行本地上下文推理。

Result: RDMA降低隐私风险，F1性能提升超30%，推理成本降低10倍。

Conclusion: 该方法可帮助临床医生避免使用云服务的隐私风险，获取关键罕见病信息，支持罕见病患者更早诊断，代码开源。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial
information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical
abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with
cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare
Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts
identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical
observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling
clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying
contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks
while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences
costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using
cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems,
supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients. Available at

Result: 相比基线实现，实现高达50倍加速，且保留原方法输出保真度，在多数据集上验证。

Conclusion: Fast - VAT可靠，能有效评估数据集的聚类趋势。

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised
technique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets.
However, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance
limitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In
this work, we present Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT
algorithm in Python, augmented with Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and
Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach
achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving
the output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of
real and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify
subsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and
t-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering
results from DBSCAN and K-Means to confirm its reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型扩展使GPU内存压力增大，现有默认分配器浪费内存，导致优化技术失效。

Method: 引入结合离线规划与在线分配的新范式，离线规划利用时空规律生成分配计划，在线分配处理复杂动态模型。

Result: 作为可插拔的PyTorch分配器，平均降低碎片率79.2%，最高达100%，性能提升最高32.5%。

Conclusion: STWeaver能实现更高效、高吞吐量的训练配置，提高训练性能。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased
GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible
overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations
and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.

Abstract: Despite the transformative potential of AI, the concept of neural networks
that can produce other neural networks by generating model weights
(hypernetworks) has been largely understudied. One of the possible reasons is
the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of
hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed
for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5
neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10
classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can
identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing
cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic
classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with
accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks
can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the
code that generates it are open and accessible to the public.

Result: ProTeGi在低API成本下绝对性能最强但计算时间长，APE - OPRO在性能、API效率和可扩展性间取得平衡，且发现模型对标签格式敏感。

Conclusion: 研究结果为商业应用中实施APO提供可操作见解，为多标签、视觉和多模态提示优化研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Prompt design is a critical factor in the effectiveness of Large Language
Models (LLMs), yet remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale.
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) methods for real-world, high-stakes multiclass
classification in a commercial setting, addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature where most of the APO frameworks have been validated only
on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity.
  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the
complementary strengths of APE and OPRO, achieving notably better
cost-efficiency, around $18\%$ improvement over OPRO, without sacrificing
performance. We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and
gradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.
  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute
performance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted
in~\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between
performance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation
studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to
label formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior. These
findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial
applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label,
vision, and multimodal prompt optimization scenarios.

Result: 该攻击能导致范数估计失败或构造出使最优估计器失效的对抗输入，下界构造与已知上界匹配。

Conclusion: 揭示了压缩表示的基本漏洞，以及与图像分类对抗攻击的结构相似性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used
technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the
black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in
$R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional
sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain
approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch.
  We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$)
queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an
adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution
(used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching
matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query
responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the
query distribution.
  Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of
tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson
Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results
uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification,
highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.

Motivation: 离散流模型（DFMs）因依赖迭代解码过程导致采样速度慢，需解决少步生成问题。

Method: 提出Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi)迭代方法，通过纠正源和目标分布之间的耦合来减少因子分解误差。

Result: 理论证明ReDi每一步保证条件总相关性单调递减，实验表明显著降低条件总相关性，实现少步生成，且整流耦合适用于训练高效一步图像生成模型。

Conclusion: ReDi为解决少步生成挑战提供简单且有理论依据的方法，为高效离散数据合成提供新视角。

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for
high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due
to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a
multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,
which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we
rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using
Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce
the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose
Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces
factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target
distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a
monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,
ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for
training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple
and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,
providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准VAE在潜在空间维度超过十几个时，解码随机潜在向量通常无法生成有意义数据。

Method: 用超球坐标表示VAE的潜在变量，压缩潜在向量到超球上的一个“岛”，并提出潜在空间的新参数化方法。

Result: 减少了潜在稀疏性，提升了VAE的生成能力。

Conclusion: 采用超球坐标表示潜在变量及新参数化方法能有效解决标准VAE的问题。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent
vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, decoding a
random latent vector from the prior usually does not produce meaningful data,
at least when the latent space has more than a dozen dimensions. In this paper,
we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics:
in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction
distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent
variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing
the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the
latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the
VAE. We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited
computational overhead.

Conclusion: HalMit的黑盒特性和优越性能使其成为提高大语言模型驱动系统可靠性的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a
popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI
deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are
inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the
credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the
intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.
Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to
ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches
either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify
hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent
agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the
generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations
without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a
probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient
number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently
identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing
approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior
performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of
LLM-powered systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a "bag" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.

Conclusion: 方差感知策略优化能降低输出比默认策略更差策略的风险，是更优的偏好对齐方法。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) typically involves training a
reward model on preference data, followed by policy optimization with respect
to the reward model. However, optimizing policies with respect to a single
reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward
model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on
open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on
the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting
the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,
we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause
overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this
risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for
preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy
regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that
variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a
worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model
configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust
alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.

Abstract: Recent advances have discussed cell complexes as ideal learning
representations. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods
suitable for learning on CW complexes. In this paper, we derive an explicit
expression for the Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal
distributions in terms of a Hodge-Laplacian matrix. This leads to a
structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes and define the optimal
transportation map. In order to simultaneously include both feature and
structure information, we extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW
complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability
measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.

Abstract: In this short note, we propose a unified framework that bridges three areas:
(1) a flipped perspective on the Turing Test, the "dual Turing test", in which
a human judge's goal is to identify an AI rather than reward a machine for
deception; (2) a formal adversarial classification game with explicit quality
constraints and worst-case guarantees; and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL)
alignment pipeline that uses an undetectability detector and a set of quality
related components in its reward model. We review historical precedents, from
inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing
classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased
difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define
the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a
prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,
and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's
feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style
alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward
for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.
Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the
meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative
adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate
actions.

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to
advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to
output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest
as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the
formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate
conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these
challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven
$\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG
automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first
constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These
agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define
the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these
CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated
extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by
design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts
as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large
Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond
standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the
functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications
as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This
work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of
automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for
measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly
available.

Method: 对比原始模型和压缩模型的SAEs，测试原始模型训练的SAEs对压缩模型的解释能力，尝试剪枝原始SAE。

Result: 原始模型训练的SAEs能解释压缩模型，只是性能略有下降；剪枝原始SAE与在剪枝模型上训练新SAE性能相当。

Conclusion: 该发现可减轻SAEs的大量训练成本。

Abstract: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To
address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and
quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability
remains elusive. While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as
circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly
effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In
this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed
models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the
compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the
trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original
SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned
model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of
SAEs.

Method: 提出SAL - GP框架，采用多层GP模型，各层特征映射到局部校准修正，通过结构化多层核耦合各层GP。

Result: 框架能捕捉局部语义依赖和全局校准一致性，持续传播预测不确定性。

Conclusion: SAL - GP框架增强了与网络架构一致的可解释性，可对深度模型进行置信度一致性和不确定性量化的原则性评估。

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

Conclusion: PSVGP方法能解决现有SVGP方法的不足，适合在下一代超级计算机上进行原位训练和数据分析。

Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of
exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible
than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely
on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical
analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning
algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting
must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is
distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable
approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model
independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is
scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect
of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between
neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea
by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial
partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to
smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our
decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly
scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in
terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the
independent SVGP case.

Conclusion: 挑战了持续学习理论处理中静态核近似的有效性，即使在大规模情况下也不适用。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the
functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel
regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is
linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK
during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep
learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical
discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However,
this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data
distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where
the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual
learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural
training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel
approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large
scale.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning, reducing computational complexity and
memory consumption has become a critical challenge, and ternary neural networks
(NNs) that restrict parameters to $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ have attracted attention as a
promising approach. While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in
practical applications such as image recognition and natural language
processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the
perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the
number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions
increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with
respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices
to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a
lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of
general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some
sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative
disorder with substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response.
Despite recent therapeutic advances, predictive models capable of accurately
forecasting individualized disease trajectories remain limited. Here, we
present a machine learning-based operator learning framework for personalized
modeling of AD progression, integrating longitudinal multimodal imaging,
biomarker, and clinical data. Unlike conventional models with prespecified
dynamics, our approach directly learns patient-specific disease operators
governing the spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration
biomarkers. Using Laplacian eigenfunction bases, we construct geometry-aware
neural operators capable of capturing complex brain dynamics. Embedded within a
digital twin paradigm, the framework enables individualized predictions,
simulation of therapeutic interventions, and in silico clinical trials. Applied
to AD clinical data, our method achieves high prediction accuracy exceeding 90%
across multiple biomarkers, substantially outperforming existing approaches.
This work offers a scalable, interpretable platform for precision modeling and
personalized therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: While large-scale training data is fundamental for developing capable large
language models (LLMs), strategically selecting high-quality data has emerged
as a critical approach to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational
costs. Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,
training-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training
and data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model
(DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a
dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the
dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework
is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and
the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection
methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a
model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights
into the data preference of the model during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Verilog生成LLM评估基准无法复现真实设计流程，存在设计简单、规格不足、验证环境不严格等问题。

Method: 构建RealBench基准，包含复杂真实IP设计、多模态格式化规格和严格验证环境，支持模块级和系统级任务。

Result: 对多种LLM和智能体评估，最佳表现的o1 - preview在模块级任务pass@1仅13.3%，系统级任务为0%。

Conclusion: 未来需要更强的Verilog生成模型，且基准已开源。

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs)
has garnered significant interest in hardware design automation. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation fall short in
replicating real-world design workflows due to their designs' simplicity,
inadequate design specifications, and less rigorous verification environments.
To address these limitations, we present RealBench, the first benchmark aiming
at real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks. RealBench features complex,
structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design
specifications, and rigorous verification environments, including 100% line
coverage testbenches and a formal checker. It supports both module-level and
system-level tasks, enabling comprehensive assessments of LLM capabilities.
Evaluations on various LLMs and agents reveal that even one of the
best-performing LLMs, o1-preview, achieves only a 13.3% pass@1 on module-level
tasks and 0% on system-level tasks, highlighting the need for stronger Verilog
generation models in the future. The benchmark is open-sourced at
https://github.com/IPRC-DIP/RealBench.

Motivation: 现有检测方法缺乏详细可解释性且无跨模态统一基准，难以应对生成式AI带来的虚假信息风险。

Method: 引入多模态基准METER，包含四个赛道，要求分类和提供证据链解释；提出三阶段Chain-of-Thought训练策略。

Result: METER比现有基准有更广泛的模态覆盖和更丰富的可解释性指标。

Conclusion: 希望METER为生成式媒体时代的可泛化、可解释伪造检测提供标准化基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images,
videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of
misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary
classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of
forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.
Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a
unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To
address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark
for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and
audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not
only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations,
including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type
tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage
and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class
tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned,
three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a
novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.
We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing
generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative
media.

Motivation: 现有分子属性预测模型的表示法忽略表面局部现象，3D方法有细节缺失或计算昂贵问题，需新表示法。

Method: 引入AMPTCR分子表面表示法，在DGCNN框架下对分子重量和细菌生长抑制两项任务进行评估。

Result: 分子重量任务验证R^2为0.87；细菌抑制任务分类ROC AUC为0.912，回归R^2为0.54。

Conclusion: AMPTCR是一种紧凑、有表现力且与架构无关的表面介导分子属性建模表示法。

Abstract: Machine learning models for molecular property prediction generally rely on
representations -- such as SMILES strings and molecular graphs -- that overlook
the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based
approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive
SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these
limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and
Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that
combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors
within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically
meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates
transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with
conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN
framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For
molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful
data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR
enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values
using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints
as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,
and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that
AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation
for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.

Conclusion: 所提出的分散式多智能体强化学习框架能有效提高样本效率，优化DNN硬件映射的延迟和能耗。

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing
latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone
of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping
space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its
effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a
decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to
overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our
framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training
multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that
assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation
analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that
significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL
approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL,
achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP)
reduction under iso-sample conditions.

Method: 从MNIST数据集创建一系列视觉难度递增的二元分类任务，构建受控框架进行研究。

Result: 成功泛化所需的最小模型容量与任务复杂度成正比；训练的网络对极端剪枝（高达95%稀疏性）具有鲁棒性；过参数化在对抗输入损坏的鲁棒性方面有显著优势；识别出的稀疏子网络保留了原始密集模型的核心推理过程。

Conclusion: 为简单神经网络的基本权衡提供了清晰的实证证明。

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

Result: 在多种数据集、微调方法和配置下实验表明，ResAlign在下游微调后能更好保留安全性并保持良性生成能力。

Conclusion: ResAlign比先前的去学习方法更能在下游微调时保留模型安全性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

Conclusion: 领域适配的大语言模型有加速材料发现的潜力，为钙钛矿光伏研究提供了数据驱动的闭环框架。

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

Result: 在基准数据集实验中，HPGNN在异质图下游任务超多数SOTA方法，在同质图表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: HPGNN能平衡多尺度信息且抗噪，是现实图学习问题的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often
assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption
does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for
heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking
multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal
performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across
nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating
Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces
an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture
long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces
computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By
embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks,
HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness.
The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art
methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining
competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance
multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution
for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at

Conclusion: CenSurv在癌症生存预测上表现优越，ECMC模块有提升效果，代码开源利于后续研究。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for
personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the
relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully
leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer
performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during
the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality
graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer
survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to
model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance
degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to
simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing
scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore
modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play
event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored
data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate
survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data
into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase
the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of
the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various
modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,
the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of
CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.

Conclusion: 避免过参数化的分析方法能有效控制SGD训练两层PINNs的训练损失和期望损失。

Abstract: This work focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
Past work on this topic has been based on the over-parameterization regime,
whose convergence may require the network width to increase vastly with the
number of training samples. So, the theory derived from over-parameterization
may incur prohibitive computational costs and is far from practical
experiments. We perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in
training two-layer PINNs, making certain assumptions about the target function
to avoid over-parameterization. Given $\epsilon>0$, we show that if the network
width exceeds a threshold that depends only on $\epsilon$ and the problem, then
the training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\epsilon)$.

Abstract: Unbalanced tabular data sets present significant challenges for predictive
modeling and data analysis across a wide range of applications. In many
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare
event prediction, minority classes are vastly underrepresented, making it
difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models
that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds
promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by
providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a
benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly
unbalanced tabular data sets.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data
SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to
synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained
on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods,
such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse
data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space. We show that
upsampled synthetic training data consistently results in top-performing
predictive models, particularly for mixed-type data sets containing very few
minority samples.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Abstract: Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods
reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health,
finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered
clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were
developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns
has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where
geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in
continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this
validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically
defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into
finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect
ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical
patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5
norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior
performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately
detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation
guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous
correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant
structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both
model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial
homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which
abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable
building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation
of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于梯度的NAS方法评估过度依赖DARTS基准且实现分散，导致评估饱和和难以进行公平可复现比较，阻碍进一步发展。

Method: 引入可配置优化器（confopt）库，提供最小API方便集成新搜索空间，支持将NAS优化器分解为核心组件；创建新的基于DARTS的基准套件并结合新评估协议。

Conclusion: confopt库有助于简化基于梯度的一次性NAS方法的开发和评估，推动该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design
choices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces
two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily
rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available
benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements
often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate
repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further
development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an
extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes
it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the
decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this
framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them
with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed. The code can be

Method: 利用稀疏二进制超向量和Tsetlin Machines，通过结构化消息传递编码图，形成符号超向量，还构建局部可解释性框架。

Result: 在TUDataset基准上验证，与神经图模型相比有有竞争力的准确性和强符号透明度。

Conclusion: 所提出的多层符号框架可用于图分类，且具有局部可解释性和良好性能。

Abstract: We propose a multilayered symbolic framework for general graph classification
that leverages sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Each graph is
encoded through structured message passing, where node, edge, and attribute
information are bound and bundled into a symbolic hypervector. This process
preserves the hierarchical semantics of the graph through layered binding from
node attributes to edge relations to structural roles resulting in a compact,
discrete representation. We also formulate a local interpretability framework
which lends itself to a key advantage of our approach being locally
interpretable. We validate our method on TUDataset benchmarks, demonstrating
competitive accuracy with strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph
models.

Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has
emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing
the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and
preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have
contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning
(FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that
emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric
perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data
properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is
critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to
enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric
taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the
structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data
Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to
overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three
orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration.
Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large
Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction
aligned with emerging trends in GML.

TL;DR: 提出解决Transformer长上下文处理问题的创新方法SSE，在多任务基准测试中表现良好，是有前景的长上下文建模架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在长上下文场景存在计算和内存效率问题，现有线性注意力变体在某些任务性能下降，需更有效的上下文压缩方法。

Method: 提出线性注意力的行稀疏更新公式，基于信息分类实现稀疏状态更新；提出稀疏状态扩展（SSE），将上下文状态扩展到多个分区。

Result: SSE在多基准测试中表现出强检索性能，2B SSE - H模型经强化学习训练后在数学推理任务上达小推理模型最优。

Conclusion: SSE是有前景且高效的长上下文建模架构。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的推荐系统难以适应冷启动场景，且现有解决方案维护和更新成本高。

Method: 引入元学习框架，用一阶（Reptile）和二阶（MAML）优化学习软提示嵌入，通过情景采样、内循环适应和外循环泛化对提示进行元优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上，自适应模型在NDCG@10、HR@10和MRR指标上优于强基线，能实时运行；支持零历史个性化，275ms的适应率可用于金融系统实时风险分析。

Conclusion: 该框架可用于推荐系统冷启动，还能增强国家金融基础设施的弹性。

Abstract: Generative, explainable, and flexible recommender systems, derived using
Large Language Models (LLM) are promising and poorly adapted to the cold-start
user situation, where there is little to no history of interaction. The current
solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are
dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This
paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based
recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt
embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by
treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,
these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent
user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic
sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On
MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model
outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in
real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization
is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation
allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening
detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275
ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial
institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly
versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment
networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial
infrastructure resilience.

Result: 在两个数据集上测试，比CNN网络有更好的准确率、抗噪性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出了利用神经科学和机器学习协同作用解决神经网络视觉绑定问题的新机制。

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of
artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the
agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the
network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture
that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by
agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by
matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire
network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise
robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification
tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that
combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling
neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that
the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of
neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the
same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We
drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all
layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto
dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with
similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits
of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one
composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.
Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to
noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel
mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by
leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

Motivation: 传统基于算法的容错技术难以处理注意力机制中的错误检测，需要新方法。

Method: 提出Flash - ABFT方法，对注意力层的查询、键和值矩阵的三矩阵乘积（包括softmax操作）进行单次在线校验。

Result: Flash - ABFT硬件面积开销仅5.3%，能耗开销小于1.9%。

Conclusion: Flash - ABFT是注意力加速器错误检测的经济高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers and large language models (LLMs), powered by the attention
mechanism, have transformed numerous AI applications, driving the need for
specialized hardware accelerators. A major challenge in these accelerators is
efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional
algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix
multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism,
particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes
Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire
three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer,
including the softmax operation, with a single check. This approach
significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while
maintaining high fault-detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that Flash-ABFT incurs only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9%
energy overhead, making it a cost-effective and robust solution for error
detection in attention accelerators.

Conclusion: 所提出的解决潜在空间不对齐的方法可行且有效，能在语义通信中平衡准确性、通信负担和复杂度。

Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the
meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks
that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on
different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches
may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a
novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic
communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair
that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel
equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel
impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving
a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic
MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity
constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the
main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the
solutions.

Result: 与顶级自监督学习模型相比，性能提升达5.03%，有更高效的缩放曲线。

Conclusion: FISHER有出色能力，还探究了下游任务缩放定律并指出未来工作方向。

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze
industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the
industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we
summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems
and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between
modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals
can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a
result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal
compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER
considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band
information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit
and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop
the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial
signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,
FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general
performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We
also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential
avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on

Result: Screen2AX准确推断层次树，F1分数达77%，在评估基准上性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Screen2AX能有效改善自主代理对复杂桌面界面的解释和交互能力。

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the ability to curate high-quality training
data is as crucial as model design. Coresets offer a principled approach to
data reduction, enabling efficient learning on large datasets through
importance sampling. However, conventional sensitivity-based coreset
construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance
metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation. In this
work, we present a systematic framework for tuning the coreset generation
process to enhance downstream classification quality. Our method introduces new
tunable parameters--including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation,
and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.
Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, we
demonstrate that tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla
coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an
effective path towards better and more efficient model training.

Result: 在三个微调任务中成功应用CAFT，未修改微调数据的情况下，将错误对齐响应减少10倍且不降低训练分布上的性能。

Conclusion: CAFT是一种无需修改训练数据即可引导大语言模型泛化的新方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended
out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on
modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the
intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce
Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages
interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without
needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target
distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding
to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear
projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended
generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,
including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow
task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.
Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses
by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,
CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without
modifying training data.

Conclusion: 显式优化校准度可产生更可靠的推理模型。

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a
variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful
applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the
correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize
guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect
of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate
incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper
describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach
to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated
confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical
confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward
function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a
scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.
We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that
uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both
accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR
substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain
and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and
classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL
hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized
confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration
via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly
optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning
models.

Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.

*Ziqiao Yu,Pengfei Sun,Dan F. M. Goodman*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 研究代用梯度下降训练的脉冲神经网络在有无延迟学习下能否从精确脉冲时序而非仅发放率学习，通过合成任务和修改数据集测试，还评估鲁棒性并发布修改数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究代用梯度下降训练的脉冲神经网络从精确脉冲时序学习的能力。

Method: 设计合成任务，构建去除脉冲计数信息的数据集变体，评估生物启发扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: 代用梯度下降训练的脉冲神经网络表现显著高于随机水平，纯发放率模型表现为随机水平；不同扰动有特定性能下降；反转脉冲序列性能大幅下降，有延迟学习的网络下降更大。

Conclusion: 代用梯度下降训练的脉冲神经网络能从精确脉冲时序学习，有延迟学习的网络行为更像人类；发布修改数据集便于进一步研究。

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained
with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay
learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first
design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and
cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based
speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech
Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is
eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate
GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely
rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under
biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or
per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but
perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when
spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from
SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in
terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have
released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用运行时分析指导编译器优化决策，结合静态分析和实际执行行为提升性能。

Method: 按分析方法、优化方式、编译器集成和目标架构对PGO研究进行系统分类，展示设计原则，用代表性示例评估性能。

Result: 展示了PGO的加速效果、开销和集成成熟度。

Conclusion: 指出减少采样开销、处理动态输入工作负载和支持跨架构可移植性等挑战，提出低开销分析和高级编译器的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) uses runtime profiling to direct compiler
optimization decisions, effectively combining static analysis with actual
execution behavior to enhance performance. Runtime profiles, collected through
instrumentation or hardware- and software-assisted sampling, provide detailed
insights into control flow, branch predictions, and memory access patterns.
This survey systematically categorizes PGO research by profiling method
(instrumentation vs. sampling), optimizations (compile time and link/post-link
time), compiler integration (GCC, LLVM), and target architectures. Key
algorithms and frameworks are shown in terms of design principles. Performance
evaluation on representative examples demonstrates PGO's speedups, overheads,
and integration maturity. Finally, we identify open challenges, such as
reducing sampling overhead, dynamic input workloads, and supporting
cross-architecture portability, and propose future research directions to
low-overhead profiling and advanced compilers.

TL;DR: 提出AlgoTune基准测试来评估语言模型设计和实现算法的能力，开发基线代理AlgoTuner，发现当前模型缺乏算法创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估多聚焦人类已解决任务，需测试模型在开放式基准中设计和实现算法的能力。

Method: 创建包含155个编码任务的AlgoTune基准和验证、计时框架，开发基线代理AlgoTuner并在前沿模型中评估。

Result: AlgoTuner较参考求解器平均加速1.72倍，但当前模型未发现算法创新，倾向表面优化。

Conclusion: 期望AlgoTune促进超越人类先进水平的创造性解决问题的语言模型代理的发展。

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus
far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved,
including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al.,
2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement
algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that
efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science,
physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 155 coding tasks
collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing
LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations
from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent,
AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models.
AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers,
which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that
current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring
surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of
LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编程竞赛数据集规模和质量有限，语言模型数据需求大，且程序合成过程与人不一致。

Method: 引入支持教模型修复的自举算法。

Result: 自举算法始终优于常规微调，自举模型与大68%的微调模型表现相当，自举修复在推理时能提升非修复性能，推理时修复可能不如直接采样。

Conclusion: 自举算法有效，同时指出APPS数据集训练部分测试用例存在问题。

Abstract: Language models for program synthesis are usually trained and evaluated on
programming competition datasets (MBPP, APPS). However, these datasets are
limited in size and quality, while these language models are extremely data
hungry. Additionally, the language models have a misaligned program synthesis
process compared to humans. While humans iteratively develop code with the help
of a compiler, most program synthesis models currently produce code in one go.
To solve these issues, we introduce a bootstrapping algorithm for program
synthesis, that supports teaching models how to repair. We show that
bootstrapping consistently outperforms regular fine-tuning. Compared to other
work, our bootstrapped model performs on par with fine-tuned models that are
68\% larger. Notably, bootstrapping with repairing also improves non-repairing
performance compared to regular bootstrapping during inference. However, on our
models, repairing during inference is likely inferior to simply sampling the
same number of solutions. Furthermore, we find that there are issues with the
example test cases in the training portion of the APPS dataset that are
valuable to the community, as many repairing and reinforcement learning methods
rely on them.

TL;DR: 本文提出StaAgent框架，利用大语言模型评估静态分析器规则，实验表明能发现多个分析器的问题规则，部分已修复或确认。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态分析器规则实现测试不足且易有不一致性，需方法改进其可靠性。

Method: 提出包含种子生成、代码验证、变异生成和分析器评估四个代理的StaAgent框架，用五个大语言模型对五个静态分析器进行评估。

Result: 发现五个静态分析器最新版本的64个问题规则，53个问题不能被基线检测到，部分已修复或确认。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，基于大语言模型的代理数据合成对软件工程有前景。

Abstract: Static analyzers play a critical role in identifying bugs early in the
software development lifecycle, but their rule implementations are often
under-tested and prone to inconsistencies. To address this, we propose
StaAgent, an agentic framework that harnesses the generative capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically evaluate static analyzer rules.
StaAgent comprises four specialized agents: a Seed Generation Agent that
translates bug detection rules into concrete, bug-inducing seed programs; a
Code Validation Agent that ensures the correctness of these seeds; a Mutation
Generation Agent that produces semantically equivalent mutants; and an Analyzer
Evaluation Agent that performs metamorphic testing by comparing the static
analyzer's behavior on seeds and their corresponding mutants. By revealing
inconsistent behaviors, StaAgent helps uncover flaws in rule implementations.
This LLM-driven, multi-agent framework offers a scalable and adaptable solution
to improve the reliability of static analyzers. We evaluated StaAgent with five
state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeL-lama, DeepSeek, Codestral, Qwen, and GPT-4o)
across five widely used static analyzers (SpotBugs, SonarQube, ErrorProne,
Infer, and PMD). The experimental results show that our approach can help
reveal 64 problematic rules in the latest versions of these five static
analyzers (i.e., 28 in SpotBugs, 18 in SonarQube, 6 in ErrorProne, 4 in Infer,
and 8 in PMD). In addition, 53 out of the 64 bugs cannot be detected by the
SOTA baseline. We have reported all the bugs to developers, with two of them
already fixed. Three more have been confirmed by developers, while the rest are
awaiting response. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
and underscore the promise of agentic, LLM-driven data synthesis to advance
software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统移动应用翻译方法耗时费力，现有机器学习方法缺乏上下文理解和适应性，LLM在跨平台应用翻译方面研究不足，需推进软件工程自动化。

Method: 开发考虑依赖、规范、程序结构和控制流的代理链进行从安卓到iOS的应用翻译，手动检查翻译代码的语法、语义和功能完整性，对翻译失败进行根因分析。

Result: 文档未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文档未明确提及具体结论，但目的是找出关键失败点并提出改进翻译性能的指南。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of mobile applications has led to a significant demand
for cross-platform compatibility, particularly between the Android and iOS
platforms. Traditional approaches to mobile application translation often rely
on manual intervention or rule-based systems, which are labor-intensive and
time-consuming. While recent advancements in machine learning have introduced
automated methods, they often lack contextual understanding and adaptability,
resulting in suboptimal translations. Large Language Models (LLMs) were
recently leveraged to enhance code translation at different granularities,
including the method, class, and repository levels. Researchers have
investigated common errors, limitations, and potential strategies to improve
these tasks. However, LLM-based application translation across different
platforms, such as migrating mobile applications between Android and iOS or
adapting software across diverse frameworks, remains underexplored.
Understanding the performance, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in
cross-platform application translation is critical for advancing software
engineering automation. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating
LLM-based agentic approaches for mobile application translation, identifying
key failure points, and proposing guidelines to improve translation
performance. We developed a chain of agents that account for dependencies,
specifications, program structure, and program control flow when translating
applications from Android to iOS. To evaluate the performance, we manually
examined the translated code for syntactic correctness, semantic accuracy, and
functional completeness. For translation failures, we further conducted a
detailed root cause analysis to understand the underlying limitations of the
agentic translation process and identify opportunities for improvement.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨MCP服务器构建自动化，提出AutoMCP编译器，评估显示其能实现近完全自动化构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前构建MCP服务器需手动重复操作，论文旨在研究能否自动化构建MCP服务器。

Method: 分析MCP采用趋势，提出AutoMCP编译器，用50个真实世界API评估。

Result: 76.5%调用开箱即用，经小修复后成功率达99.9%。

Conclusion: 分析MCP采用情况，证明OpenAPI规范可实现近完全自动化，提供工具集及修复规范缺陷的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into
active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable
protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP),
introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic
tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and
repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and
configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims
to eliminate.
  This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully
automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged
GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include
servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive
scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates
MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API
definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema
registration and authentication handling.
  We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across
over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded
out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all
attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After
minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9%
success.
  Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server
development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality
issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a
corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common
specification flaws.

Result: 开发出 APCE 工具，有演示链接。

Conclusion: APCE 能帮助开发者和研究者使用和研究大语言模型生成的提交消息。

Abstract: Commit messages in a version control system provide valuable information for
developers regarding code changes in software systems. Commit messages can be
the only source of information left for future developers describing what was
changed and why. However, writing high-quality commit messages is often
neglected in practice. Large Language Model (LLM) generated commit messages
have emerged as a way to mitigate this issue. We introduce the AI-Powered
Commit Explorer (APCE), a tool to support developers and researchers in the use
and study of LLM-generated commit messages. APCE gives researchers the option
to store different prompts for LLMs and provides an additional evaluation
prompt that can further enhance the commit message provided by LLMs. APCE also
provides researchers with a straightforward mechanism for automated and human
evaluation of LLM-generated messages. Demo link https://youtu.be/zYrJ9s6sZvo

Motivation: 解决大语言模型和多模态大语言模型在设计到代码转换中存在的可解释性、可扩展性、资源需求和可重复性等挑战。

Method: 开发训练和推理管道，训练管道包含设计优化器、标签和特征检测、自动组件；推理管道处理实际设计以生成代码指令。

Conclusion: 提出的LDMs是理解设计并生成高效可靠代码的可靠且优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language
Models (LLMs), numerous challenges related to interpretability, scalability,
resource requirements and repeatability remain, related to their application in
the design-to-code space. To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models
(LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless
conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference
pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture
modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design
Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses
sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and
fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI
elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable
components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while
enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but
key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline
processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions
for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models
illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a
novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior
performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning,
responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and
feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in
identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our
proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs
that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable
production-ready code.

Result: 在三艘自主船舶上评估，三种变体有效性因船而异。

Conclusion: 给出WPgen的研究和实际应用意义。

Abstract: Self-adaptation in maritime autonomous vessels (AVs) enables them to adapt
their behaviors to address unexpected situations while maintaining
dependability requirements. During the design of such AVs, it is crucial to
understand and identify the settings that should trigger adaptations, enabling
validation of their implementation. To this end, we focus on the navigation
software of AVs, which must adapt their behavior during operation through
adaptations. AVs often rely on predefined waypoints to guide them along
designated routes, ensuring safe navigation. We propose a multiobjective
search-based approach, called WPgen, to generate minor modifications to the
predefined set of waypoints, keeping them as close as possible to the original
waypoints, while causing the AV to navigate inappropriately when navigating
with the generated waypoints. WPgen uses NSGA-II as the multi-objective search
algorithm with three seeding strategies for its initial population, resulting
in three variations of WPgen. We evaluated these variations on three AVs (one
overwater tanker and two underwater). We compared the three variations of WPgen
with Random Search as the baseline and with each other. Experimental results
showed that the effectiveness of these variations varied depending on the AV.
Based on the results, we present the research and practical implications of
WPgen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在代码生成中对提示扰动敏感，现实中扰动常见，需提升其对提示扰动的鲁棒性以确保实际代码生成性能。

Method: 提出CREME方法，先通过比较原始提示和扰动提示的隐藏状态识别鲁棒性敏感层，再对识别层进行轻量级参数编辑。

Result: 在两个代码生成基准测试及其扰动版本上评估，CREME使扰动提示的Pass@1准确率提高63%，在干净输入上性能稳定，准确率偏差在1%以内。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性敏感层主要集中在网络中间和深层，不同模型架构中位置不同，为未来面向鲁棒性的编辑策略提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation, where the natural language prompt plays a crucial role in
conveying user intent to the model. However, prior studies have shown that LLMs
are highly sensitive to prompt perturbations. Minor modifications in wording,
syntax, or formatting can significantly reduce the functional correctness of
generated code. As perturbations frequently occur in real-world scenarios,
improving the robustness of LLMs to prompt perturbations is essential for
ensuring reliable performance in practical code generation. In this paper, we
introduce CREME (Code Robustness Enhancement via Model Editing), a novel
approach that enhances LLM robustness through targeted parameter updates. CREME
first identifies robustness-sensitive layers by comparing hidden states between
an original prompt and its perturbed variant. Then, it performs lightweight
parameter editing at the identified layer to reduce performance degradation. We
evaluate CREME on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and
MBPP) along with their perturbed counterparts. Experimental results show that
CREME improves Pass@1 accuracy by 63% on perturbed prompts while maintaining
stable performance on clean inputs, with accuracy deviations within 1%. Further
analysis reveals that robustness-sensitive layers are primarily concentrated in
the middle and deeper layers of the network, and their locations vary across
different model architectures. These insights provide a valuable foundation for
developing future robustness-oriented editing strategies.

Abstract: Research scientists increasingly rely on implementing software to support
their research. While previous research has examined the impact of identifier
names on program comprehension in traditional programming environments, limited
work has explored this area in scientific software, especially regarding the
quality of method names in the code. The recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for automating code analysis tasks,
such as identifier name appraisals and recommendations. Our study evaluates
four popular LLMs on their ability to analyze grammatical patterns and suggest
improvements for 496 method names extracted from Python-based Jupyter
Notebooks. Our findings show that the LLMs are somewhat effective in analyzing
these method names and generally follow good naming practices, like starting
method names with verbs. However, their inconsistent handling of
domain-specific terminology and only moderate agreement with human annotations
indicate that automated suggestions require human evaluation. This work
provides foundational insights for improving the quality of scientific code
through AI automation.

Motivation: 定量指标评估不全面，大规模人工评估成本高，探索LLM作为评判者在代码相关任务中的有效性及自动化可能性。

Method: 对代码生成，检查8个LLM判断1405个Java方法和1281个Python函数正确性的能力；对代码摘要，比较5个LLM与9个人类对约1200个摘要的评判。

Result: GPT - 4 - turbo在两项任务评判能力上最佳，参数数十亿的小模型无法胜任评判任务，且最佳LLM也常误判。

Conclusion: 大语言模型作为评判者在代码生成和摘要任务中有一定作用，但存在明显不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex
natural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate
to an LLM the assessment of the "quality" of the output provided by an
automated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only
tell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be
too expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can
also unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a
solution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what
is the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of
LLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code
summarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,
quantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code
summarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as
BLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,
even state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances
of these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced
solutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check
whether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and
1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For
code summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by
nine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our
findings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities
for both tasks, with "smaller" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not
being able to cope with judging tasks. However, even the best-performing LLM

TL;DR: 提出轻量级可扩展方法VulCoCo检测VCCs，构建合成基准测试，实验显示其性能优，在实际项目有效并给出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCC检测工具依赖语法相似性或预测粗略无清晰解释，实用性受限。

Method: 结合基于嵌入的检索和大语言模型验证，从已知漏洞函数检索候选函数，用LLM评估是否保留漏洞，构建合成基准测试。

Result: 在基准测试中VulCoCo在Precision@k和MAP方面优于现有方法；提交400个PR，75个被合并，15个产生新CVE。

Conclusion: 提供见解以启发未来工作提升VCC检测精度。

Abstract: Code reuse is common in modern software development, but it can also spread
vulnerabilities when developers unknowingly copy risky code. The code fragments
that preserve the logic of known vulnerabilities are known as vulnerable code
clones (VCCs). Detecting those VCCs is a critical but challenging task.
Existing VCC detection tools often rely on syntactic similarity or produce
coarse vulnerability predictions without clear explanations, limiting their
practical utility. In this paper, we propose VulCoCo, a lightweight and
scalable approach that combines embedding-based retrieval with large language
model (LLM) validation. Starting from a set of known vulnerable functions, we
retrieve syntactically or semantically similar candidate functions from a large
corpus and use an LLM to assess whether the candidates retain the
vulnerability. Given that there is a lack of reproducible vulnerable code clone
benchmarks, we first construct a synthetic benchmark that spans various clone
types.
  Our experiments on the benchmark show that VulCoCo outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Precision@k and mean average precision
(MAP). In addition, we also demonstrate VulCoCo's effectiveness in real-world
projects by submitting 400 pull requests (PRs) to 284 open-source projects.
Among them, 75 PRs were merged, and 15 resulted in newly published CVEs. We
also provide insights to inspire future work to further improve the precision
of vulnerable code clone detection.

Abstract: We present VulGuard, an automated tool designed to streamline the extraction,
processing, and analysis of commits from GitHub repositories for Just-In-Time
vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP) research. VulGuard automatically mines commit
histories, extracts fine-grained code changes, commit messages, and software
engineering metrics, and formats them for downstream analysis. In addition, it
integrates several state-of-the-art vulnerability prediction models, allowing
researchers to train, evaluate, and compare models with minimal setup. By
supporting both repository-scale mining and model-level experimentation within
a unified framework, VulGuard addresses key challenges in reproducibility and
scalability in software security research. VulGuard can also be easily
integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
tool in two influential open-source projects, FFmpeg and the Linux kernel,
highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world JIT-VP research and promote
standardized benchmarking. A demo video is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型回答代码问题不可靠，RAG可降低不可靠性，但设计有效管道具有挑战。

Method: 构建检索语料库，设计评估7种RAG管道和63种变体，对无相似匹配问题降低相似度阈值；将最优管道应用于4个开源大模型并与零样本性能对比。

Result: 结合HyDE与完整答案上下文的RAG管道在检索和回答Stack Overflow问题上表现最佳；最优RAG管道在各模型上始终优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 最优RAG管道能稳健提升不同大模型对各类开发者问题的回答质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting developers with
code-related questions; however, LLMs carry the risk of generating unreliable
answers. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been
proposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,
designing effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design
choices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java
and Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore
various RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their
effectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,
we (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants
to answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new
questions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the
similarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding
partially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find
that implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding
(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering
similarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG
pipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot
performance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline
consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher
scores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These
findings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer
quality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen
and novel questions across different LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分评估基于大语言模型的RTL代码优化方法处理复杂时序逻辑的有效性，为填补此空白开展研究。

Method: 提出新的RTL优化评估基准，引入基于变形的方法系统评估基于大语言模型的RTL代码优化方法。

Result: 基于大语言模型的RTL优化方法能有效优化逻辑操作，在处理复杂时序逻辑时不如现有编译器方法，主要因大语言模型理解RTL代码时序逻辑有挑战。

Conclusion: 为进一步利用大语言模型进行RTL代码优化研究提供了见解。

Abstract: Register Transfer Level(RTL) code optimization is crucial for achieving high
performance and low power consumption in digital circuit design. However,
traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics,
which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to
leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs
can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions,
potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches
have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization
methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we
conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of
LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex
timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL
optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a
specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on
metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL
code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization
effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more
complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.
(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic
operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL
optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods
on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow
optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the
challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these
findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL
code optimization.

Abstract: The proper design and architecture of testing of machine learning models,

The most important in this process is selecting an adequate loss function used

Therefore, in this research, through empirical experiments on equity and
cryptocurrency assets, we introduce the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL)
function which is more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used
in algorithmic investment strategies. The MADL function results are compared
for Transformer and LSTM models and we show that almost in every case
Transformer results are significantly better than those obtained with LSTM.

Abstract: Causal inference in observational panel data has become a central concern in
economics,policy analysis,and the broader social sciences.To address the core
contradiction where traditional difference-in-differences (DID) struggles with
high-dimensional confounding variables in observational panel data,while
machine learning (ML) lacks causal structure interpretability,this paper
proposes an innovative framework called S-DIDML that integrates structural
identification with high-dimensional estimation.Building upon the structure of
traditional DID methods,S-DIDML employs structured residual orthogonalization
techniques (Neyman orthogonality+cross-fitting) to retain the group-time
treatment effect (ATT) identification structure while resolving
high-dimensional covariate interference issues.It designs a dynamic
heterogeneity estimation module combining causal forests and semi-parametric
models to capture spatiotemporal heterogeneity effects.The framework
establishes a complete modular application process with standardized Stata
implementation paths.The introduction of S-DIDML enriches methodological
research on DID and DDML innovations, shifting causal inference from method
stacking to architecture integration.This advancement enables social sciences
to precisely identify policy-sensitive groups and optimize resource
allocation.The framework provides replicable evaluation tools, decision
optimization references,and methodological paradigms for complex intervention
scenarios such as digital transformation policies and environmental
regulations.

Conclusion: 所提统一混合数据驱动方法能有效模拟有界域随机微分方程，捕捉内部随机动态和边界退出现象。

Abstract: Simulating stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in bounded domains,
presents significant computational challenges due to particle exit phenomena,
which requires accurate modeling of interior stochastic dynamics and boundary
interactions. Despite the success of machine learning-based methods in learning
SDEs, existing learning methods are not applicable to SDEs in bounded domains
because they cannot accurately capture the particle exit dynamics. We present a
unified hybrid data-driven approach that combines a conditional diffusion model
with an exit prediction neural network to capture both interior stochastic
dynamics and boundary exit phenomena. Our ML model consists of two major
components: a neural network that learns exit probabilities using binary
cross-entropy loss with rigorous convergence guarantees, and a training-free
diffusion model that generates state transitions for non-exiting particles
using closed-form score functions. The two components are integrated through a
probabilistic sampling algorithm that determines particle exit at each time
step and generates appropriate state transitions. The performance of the
proposed approach is demonstrated via three test cases: a one-dimensional
simplified problem for theoretical verification, a two-dimensional
advection-diffusion problem in a bounded domain, and a three-dimensional
problem of interest to magnetically confined fusion plasmas.

Conclusion: 提出的新算法有助于在上下文老虎机离线策略评估中实现给定离线数据集的条件覆盖。

Abstract: This paper investigates off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits, aiming
to quantify the performance of a target policy using data collected under a
different and potentially unknown behavior policy. Recently, methods based on
conformal prediction have been developed to construct reliable prediction
intervals that guarantee marginal coverage in finite samples, making them
particularly suited for safety-critical applications. To further achieve
coverage conditional on a given offline data set, we propose a novel algorithm
that constructs probably approximately correct prediction intervals. Our method
builds upon a PAC-valid conformal prediction framework, and we strengthen its
theoretical guarantees by establishing PAC-type bounds on coverage. We analyze
both finite-sample and asymptotic properties of the proposed method, and
compare its empirical performance with existing methods in simulations.

Motivation: 因果推断和可识别性理论虽独立发展但目标相似，且部分线性回归中无高斯处理噪声可提高估计一致性，非高斯性也是ICA识别潜在因素的关键假设，因此研究二者联系。

Method: 进行理论和实证研究，探索ICA用于部分线性回归模型因果效应估计的可能性。

Result: 发现线性ICA即使在存在高斯混杂因素或非线性干扰的情况下，也能准确估计多个处理效应。

Conclusion: ICA可用于部分线性回归模型的因果效应估计。

Abstract: The field of causal inference has developed a variety of methods to
accurately estimate treatment effects in the presence of nuisance. Meanwhile,
the field of identifiability theory has developed methods like Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) to identify latent sources and mixing weights from
data. While these two research communities have developed largely
independently, they aim to achieve similar goals: the accurate and
sample-efficient estimation of model parameters. In the partially linear
regression (PLR) setting, Mackey et al. (2018) recently found that estimation
consistency can be improved with non-Gaussian treatment noise. Non-Gaussianity
is also a crucial assumption for identifying latent factors in ICA. We provide
the first theoretical and empirical insights into this connection, showing that
ICA can be used for causal effect estimation in the PLR model. Surprisingly, we
find that linear ICA can accurately estimate multiple treatment effects even in
the presence of Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisance.

Result: 实验表明SEDA在合成和真实数据集上比现有LDA方法有更高的分类准确率和降维效果。

Conclusion: SEDA算法在分类和降维方面优于现有LDA方法。

Abstract: Regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) is a widely used tool for
classification and dimensionality reduction, but its performance in
high-dimensional scenarios is inconsistent. Existing theoretical analyses of
RLDA often lack clear insight into how data structure affects classification
performance. To address this issue, we derive a non-asymptotic approximation of
the misclassification rate and thus analyze the structural effect and
structural adjustment strategies of RLDA. Based on this, we propose the
Spectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis (SEDA) algorithm, which optimizes the
data structure by adjusting the spiked eigenvalues of the population covariance
matrix. By developing a new theoretical result on eigenvectors in random matrix
theory, we derive an asymptotic approximation on the misclassification rate of
SEDA. The bias correction algorithm and parameter selection strategy are then
obtained. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that SEDA achieves
higher classification accuracy and dimensionality reduction compared to
existing LDA methods.

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果，但有配套视频https://youtu.be/iXdCYbvpQVE 。

Conclusion: 未明确提及最终结论，但Buckaroo系统或可解决传统数据整理的问题。

Abstract: Preparing datasets -- a critical phase known as data wrangling -- constitutes
the dominant phase of data science development, consuming upwards of 80% of the
total project time. This phase encompasses a myriad of tasks: parsing data,
restructuring it for analysis, repairing inaccuracies, merging sources,
eliminating duplicates, and ensuring overall data integrity. Traditional
approaches, typically through manual coding in languages such as Python or
using spreadsheets, are not only laborious but also error-prone. These issues
range from missing entries and formatting inconsistencies to data type
inaccuracies, all of which can affect the quality of downstream tasks if not
properly corrected. To address these challenges, we present Buckaroo, a
visualization system to highlight discrepancies in data and enable on-the-spot
corrections through direct manipulations of visual objects. Buckaroo (1)
automatically finds "interesting" data groups that exhibit anomalies compared
to the rest of the groups and recommends them for inspection; (2) suggests
wrangling actions that the user can choose to repair the anomalies; and (3)
allows users to visually manipulate their data by displaying the effects of
their wrangling actions and offering the ability to undo or redo these actions,
which supports the iterative nature of data wrangling. A video companion is

Abstract: Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) enables simulation experts to optimize
complex models, but faces challenges in user experience (UX) that limit
efficiency and accessibility. While artificial intelligence (AI) has
demonstrated potential to enhance CAE processes, research integrating these
fields with a focus on UX remains fragmented. This paper presents a multivocal
literature review (MLR) examining how AI enhances UX in CAE software across
both academic research and industry implementations. Our analysis reveals
significant gaps between academic explorations and industry applications, with
companies actively implementing LLMs, adaptive UIs, and recommender systems
while academic research focuses primarily on technical capabilities without UX
validation. Key findings demonstrate opportunities in AI-powered guidance,
adaptive interfaces, and workflow automation that remain underexplored in
current research. By mapping the intersection of these domains, this study
provides a foundation for future work to address the identified research gaps
and advance the integration of AI to improve CAE user experience.

Abstract: Understanding what constitutes safety in AI-generated content is complex.
While developers often rely on predefined taxonomies, real-world safety
judgments also involve personal, social, and cultural perceptions of harm. This
paper examines how annotators evaluate the safety of AI-generated images,
focusing on the qualitative reasoning behind their judgments. Analyzing 5,372
open-ended comments, we find that annotators consistently invoke moral,
emotional, and contextual reasoning that extends beyond structured safety
categories. Many reflect on potential harm to others more than to themselves,
grounding their judgments in lived experience, collective risk, and
sociocultural awareness. Beyond individual perceptions, we also find that the
structure of the task itself -- including annotation guidelines -- shapes how
annotators interpret and express harm. Guidelines influence not only which
images are flagged, but also the moral judgment behind the justifications.
Annotators frequently cite factors such as image quality, visual distortion,
and mismatches between prompt and output as contributing to perceived harm
dimensions, which are often overlooked in standard evaluation frameworks. Our
findings reveal that existing safety pipelines miss critical forms of reasoning
that annotators bring to the task. We argue for evaluation designs that
scaffold moral reflection, differentiate types of harm, and make space for
subjective, context-sensitive interpretations of AI-generated content.

Abstract: As text-to-image generative models rapidly improve, AI researchers are making
significant advances in developing domain-specific models capable of generating
complex medical imagery from text prompts. Despite this, these technical
advancements have overlooked whether and how medical professionals would
benefit from and use text-to-image generative AI (GenAI) in practice. By
developing domain-specific GenAI without involving stakeholders, we risk the
potential of building models that are either not useful or even more harmful
than helpful. In this paper, we adopt a human-centered approach to responsible
model development by involving stakeholders in evaluating and reflecting on the
promises, risks, and challenges of a novel text-to-CT Scan GenAI model. Through
exploratory model prompting activities, we uncover the perspectives of medical
students, radiology trainees, and radiologists on the role that text-to-CT Scan
GenAI can play across medical education, training, and practice. This
human-centered approach additionally enabled us to surface technical challenges
and domain-specific risks of generating synthetic medical images. We conclude
by reflecting on the implications of medical text-to-image GenAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估XR代理技术在记者群体中的社会接受度，为XR系统改进提供依据。

Method: 适应扩展Almere模型，在真实场景进行控制实验，通过问卷收集定量和定性数据。

Result: 基于问卷的定量和定性测量结果，有助于理解特定社会背景下用户对XR代理解决方案的看法和接受度。

Conclusion: 研究有助于理解用户对XR代理的接受情况，也指出了XR系统的改进方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the findings of a user study that evaluated the
social acceptance of eXtended Reality (XR) agent technology, focusing on a
remotely accessible, web-based XR training system developed for journalists.
This system involves user interaction with a virtual avatar, enabled by a
modular toolkit. The interactions are designed to provide tailored training for
journalists in digital-remote settings, especially for sensitive or dangerous
scenarios, without requiring specialized end-user equipment like headsets. Our
research adapts and extends the Almere model, representing social acceptance
through existing attributes such as perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness, along with added ones like dependability and security in the
user-agent interaction. The XR agent was tested through a controlled experiment
in a real-world setting, with data collected on users' perceptions. Our
findings, based on quantitative and qualitative measurements involving
questionnaires, contribute to the understanding of user perceptions and
acceptance of XR agent solutions within a specific social context, while also
identifying areas for the improvement of XR systems.

TL;DR: 英国哮喘相关死亡率高、患者基础护理覆盖率低，研究通过患者调查探讨哮喘患者对聊天机器人的接受情况，多数成年患者感兴趣，给出优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 英国哮喘患者护理情况不佳，需新方法提供健康教育等，探究患者对聊天机器人的接受度及影响因素。

Method: 由哮喘临床医生、患者和技术开发者设计患者调查，样本量为1257人。

Result: 53%成年哮喘患者对使用聊天机器人感兴趣，易使用者认为病情更严重且自我管理信心低；患者青睐24/7访问、个性化及WhatsApp接入方式；阻碍因素有安全隐私担忧和对技术能力的怀疑。

Conclusion: 给出7条优化聊天机器人健康支持功效的建议。

Abstract: Asthma-related deaths in the UK are the highest in Europe, and only 30% of
patients access basic care. There is a need for alternative approaches to
reaching people with asthma in order to provide health education,
self-management support and bridges to care. Automated conversational agents
(specifically, mobile chatbots) present opportunities for providing alternative
and individually tailored access to health education, self-management support
and risk self-assessment. But would patients engage with a chatbot, and what
factors influence engagement? We present results from a patient survey (N=1257)
devised by a team of asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers,
conducted to identify optimal factors for efficacy, value and engagement for a
chatbot. Results indicate that most adults with asthma (53%) are interested in
using a chatbot and the patients most likely to do so are those who believe
their asthma is more serious and who are less confident about self-management.
Results also indicate enthusiasm for 24/7 access, personalisation, and for
WhatsApp as the preferred access method (compared to app, voice assistant, SMS
or website). Obstacles to uptake include security/privacy concerns and
skepticism of technological capabilities. We present detailed findings and
consolidate these into 7 recommendations for developers for optimising efficacy
of chatbot-based health support.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究将多个运行时监视器组合成单一监测协议，开发算法在预算约束下提高召回率，在代码审查中表现优于基线，组合监视器有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运行时监测AI可检测有害行为，需将多个运行时监视器组合成协议，在预算约束下最大化召回率。

Method: 开发算法，穷举调用监视器的时机和种类，基于Neyman - Pearson引理分配安全干预。

Result: 在代码审查中召回率比基线提高一倍多，组合两个监视器可实现帕累托最优。

Conclusion: 框架为在成本敏感场景下组合现有监视器检测不良行为提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In
this paper, we study how to combine multiple runtime monitors into a single
monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of
applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall).
Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the
protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the
monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the
most efficient protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and
which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the
Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically
trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more
than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review
setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using
either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for
combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive
settings.

TL;DR: 研究对比西方与印度大语言模型识别印度语境下残障歧视言论能力，发现差异，强调AI设计评估需关注本地残障群体经验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数在线残障歧视研究聚焦西方受众和模型，需探究其在非西方地区如印度的适用性及本地模型表现。

Method: 将公开残障歧视言论数据集翻译成印地语，让8个大语言模型（4个美国、4个印度）打分解释，同时招募美印残障人士完成相同任务。

Result: 西方模型高估、印度模型低估残障歧视危害，所有模型对印地语表达更宽容，采用西方框架；印度残障人士从意图、关系和韧性角度解读。

Conclusion: 为全球残障歧视标准提供基础，表明AI系统设计评估需以本地残障经验为中心。

Abstract: People with disabilities (PwD) experience disproportionately high levels of
discrimination and hate online, particularly in India, where entrenched stigma
and limited resources intensify these challenges. Large language models (LLMs)
are increasingly used to identify and mitigate online hate, yet most research
on online ableism focuses on Western audiences with Western AI models. Are
these models adequately equipped to recognize ableist harm in non-Western
places like India? Do localized, Indic language models perform better? To
investigate, we adopted and translated a publicly available ableist speech
dataset to Hindi, and prompted eight LLMs--four developed in the U.S. (GPT-4,
Gemini, Claude, Llama) and four in India (Krutrim, Nanda, Gajendra,
Airavata)--to score and explain ableism. In parallel, we recruited 175 PwD from
both the U.S. and India to perform the same task, revealing stark differences
between groups. Western LLMs consistently overestimated ableist harm, while
Indic LLMs underestimated it. Even more concerning, all LLMs were more tolerant
of ableism when it was expressed in Hindi and asserted Western framings of
ableist harm. In contrast, Indian PwD interpreted harm through intention,
relationality, and resilience--emphasizing a desire to inform and educate
perpetrators. This work provides groundwork for global, inclusive standards of
ableism, demonstrating the need to center local disability experiences in the
design and evaluation of AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器学习在金融贷款风险预测中伪科学假设的社会影响，以及生存偏差的影响。

Method: 从准确性和社会成本方面分析模型，并针对常用学习方法和数据集验证结果。

Result: 社会最优模型对下游任务准确性损失不大；有生存偏差的模型训练时会出现准确性稍降、召回率和精确率上升的情况，易造成系统变好的错觉。

Conclusion: 模型出现的结果是一种错觉，实际模型的不公平性和生存偏差在加剧。

Abstract: We study the societal impact of pseudo-scientific assumptions for predicting
the behavior of people in a straightforward application of machine learning to
risk prediction in financial lending. This use case also exemplifies the impact
of survival bias in loan return prediction. We analyze the models in terms of
their accuracy and social cost, showing that the socially optimal model may not
imply a significant accuracy loss for this downstream task. Our results are
verified for commonly used learning methods and datasets. Our findings also
show that there is a natural dynamic when training models that suffer survival
bias where accuracy slightly deteriorates, and whose recall and precision
improves with time. These results act as an illusion, leading the observer to
believe that the system is getting better, when in fact the model is suffering
from increasingly more unfairness and survival bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伦理框架无法充分应对语音合成中配音演员面临的新风险。

Method: 对20名专业配音演员进行定性访谈。

Result: 发现无约束语音合成复制使个人面临多种威胁，如声誉损害、责任缺失等。

Conclusion: 提出PRAC3框架，认为语音治理需恢复创作者能动性、确保可追溯性和建立伦理复用边界。

Abstract: Early large-scale audio datasets, such as LibriSpeech, were built with
hundreds of individual contributors whose voices were instrumental in the
development of speech technologies, including audiobooks and voice assistants.
Yet, a decade later, these same contributions have exposed voice actors to a
range of risks. While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit,
and Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks
involving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context,
authorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional
voice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without
enforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond
reputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive
political messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about
accountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that
are deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation
campaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal
fallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or
union protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the
PRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation,
Accountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of
data used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy
risks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm
arises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be
reimagined AI Data ecosystems. We argue that voice, as both a biometric
identifier and creative labor, demands governance models that restore creator
agency, ensure traceability, and establish enforceable boundaries for ethical
reuse.

Method: 分析现有伦理方法的不足，提出综合的以人为中心的推荐系统设计框架，整合跨学科视角、监管策略和教育举措。

Result: 指出推荐系统存在将人类复杂性简化、利用用户弱点、重参与轻福祉等问题。

Conclusion: 解决推荐系统伦理问题需超越纯技术方案，采用综合框架保障人类自主性和社会繁荣。

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by
AI-driven recommender systems (RSs), which have become central to shaping
digital environments and social interactions. By curating personalized content,
RSs do not merely reflect user preferences but actively construct individual
experiences across social media, entertainment platforms, and e-commerce.
Despite their ubiquity, the ethical implications of RSs remain insufficiently
explored, even as concerns over privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being
intensify. I argue that existing ethical approaches, including algorethics, the
effort to embed ethical principles into algorithmic design, are necessary but
ultimately inadequate. RSs inherently reduce human complexity to quantifiable
dimensions, exploit user vulnerabilities, and prioritize engagement over
well-being. Addressing these concerns requires moving beyond purely technical
solutions. I propose a comprehensive framework for human-centered RS design,
integrating interdisciplinary perspectives, regulatory strategies, and
educational initiatives to ensure AI systems foster rather than undermine human
autonomy and societal flourishing.

TL;DR: 未来测光调查需高效方法推导星系形态参数，本文提出CAE框架建模和表征星系形态，结果表明该方法能准确高效推断复杂结构特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来测光调查会产生大量星系图像，传统方法处理海量源时计算成本高，需要高效方法推导星系形态参数。

Method: 提出条件自动编码器（CAE）框架，在GalSim生成的模拟星系图像上训练，将星系图像编码为低维潜在表示并恢复形态特征和重建图像。

Result: CAE方法能准确高效地推断复杂结构特性。

Conclusion: CAE框架为现有方法提供了有力替代方案。

Abstract: Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of
galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy
morphological parameters at scale. Traditional approaches, such as parametric
light-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally
prohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a
Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and
characterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock
galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types,
photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index,
ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into
a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our
model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled
manner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate
that the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural
properties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进之前已知的最坏情况下迭代次数的下界，解决是否常数次数就足够的开放性问题，向线性目标取得进展。

Method: 基于用变形积递归构造的新颖扩展公式，定义二次目标迫使活动集方法沿着投影的抛物线边界。

Result: 证明活动集方法在最坏情况下需指数级迭代次数，改进为使用二次凸多项式的下界。

Conclusion: 解决开放性问题，向线性目标取得显著进展，若得到线性目标下所有枢轴规则的下界将是重大突破。

Abstract: We prove that the active-set method needs an exponential number of iterations
in the worst-case to maximize a convex quadratic function subject to linear
constraints, regardless of the pivot rule used. This substantially improves
over the best previously known lower bound [IPCO 2025], which needs objective
functions of polynomial degrees $\omega(\log d)$ in dimension $d$, to a bound
using a convex polynomial of degree 2. In particular, our result firmly
resolves the open question [IPCO 2025] of whether a constant degree suffices,
and it represents significant progress towards linear objectives, where the
active-set method coincides with the simplex method and a lower bound for all
pivot rules would constitute a major breakthrough.
  Our result is based on a novel extended formulation, recursively constructed
using deformed products. Its key feature is that it projects onto a polygonal
approximation of a parabola while preserving all of its exponentially many
vertices. We define a quadratic objective that forces the active-set method to
follow the parabolic boundary of this projection, without allowing any
shortcuts along chords corresponding to edges of its full-dimensional preimage.

TL;DR: 现有评估框架不适合智能搜索系统的智能搜索评估，提出RAVine框架解决问题并进行模型基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架与智能搜索目标不匹配，存在查询不真实、提取真实标签有噪声、忽略迭代过程评估等问题。

Method: 提出RAVine框架，针对多点查询和长答案，引入可归因真实标签构建策略，评估迭代过程和效率。

Result: 使用RAVine对一系列模型进行基准测试并得到一些见解。

Conclusion: 研究成果有望推动智能搜索系统的发展，代码和数据集开源。

Abstract: Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval
augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However,
existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic
search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often
deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to
introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,
leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current
frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the
evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address
these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework
for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form
answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground
truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation.
Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the
iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a
series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will
contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine.

Motivation: 满足企业对安全、可审计、上下文忠实检索的需求，为法律和金融等高风险领域提供可靠基础。

Method: 系统摄取异构内容，分割成1000-token重叠块并索引到混合存储中，用户查询经GPT - 4o优化、向量+BM25搜索、Cohere重排序，用CO - STAR提示工程回答，LangGraph验证器确保引用重叠。

Result: 在四个LegalBench子集上，1000 - token块使Recall@50提高约1pp，混合+重排序使Precision@10提高约7pp，验证器使TRACe利用率超0.50，无支持声明限制在3%以内。

Conclusion: DEREK模块能以最小运营开销提供准确、可追溯且适用于生产的文档问答。

Abstract: We present the DEREK (Deep Extraction & Reasoning Engine for Knowledge)
Module, a secure and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline designed
specifically for enterprise document question answering. Designed and
implemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,
web), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a
hybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via
combined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using
CO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,
regenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,
1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank
boosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe
Utilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All
components run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These
results demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and
production-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead. The module is
designed to meet enterprise demands for secure, auditable, and context-faithful
retrieval, providing a reliable baseline for high-stakes domains such as legal
and finance.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在有用的鲁棒性和有害的不敏感性之间的界限。

Method: 编译50个LeetCode问题，设计三种提示扰动，让六个前沿模型解决变异提示，检查Python输出。

Result: 模型对90%提示缺失仍有85%正确率，对单个量词翻转仅54%有反应，推理调优变体更不敏感，行话编辑通过率56%。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型模糊无害噪声和语义改变编辑的界限，建议采用奖励差异化敏感性的评估和训练协议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now write code in settings where misreading a
single word can break safety or cost money, yet we still expect them to
overlook stray typos. To probe where useful robustness ends and harmful
insensitivity begins, we compile 50 LeetCode problems and craft three minimal
prompt perturbations that should vary in importance: (i) progressive
underspecification deleting 10 % of words per step; (ii) lexical flip swapping
a pivotal quantifier ("max" to "min"); and (iii) jargon inflation replacing a
common noun with an obscure technical synonym. Six frontier models, including
three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python
outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they
reused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a
sharp double asymmetry. Models remain correct in 85 % of cases even after 90 %
of the prompt is missing, showing over-robustness to underspecification, yet
only 54 % react to a single quantifier flip that reverses the task, with
reasoning-tuned variants even less sensitive than their bases. Jargon edits lie
in between, passing through 56 %. Current LLMs thus blur the line between
harmless noise and meaning - changing edits, often treating both as ignorable.
Masking salient anchors such as function names can force re - evaluation. We
advocate evaluation and training protocols that reward differential
sensitivity: stay steady under benign noise but adapt - or refuse - when
semantics truly change.

Motivation: 解决低资源场景下命名实体识别中示范构建和模型训练的两个问题，即现有示范示例选择方法单一和模型参考示范示例能力不足。

Method: 针对示范示例选择，提出双相似度（语义相似度和特征相似度）方法；针对模型训练，提出对抗示范训练NER模型。

Result: 在低资源NER任务的综合实验中，所提方法优于多种方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的示范和训练方法能有效解决低资源场景下命名实体识别中的问题，提升性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) based on demonstration
learning in low-resource scenarios. We identify two issues in demonstration
construction and model training. Firstly, existing methods for selecting
demonstration examples primarily rely on semantic similarity; We show that
feature similarity can provide significant performance improvement. Secondly,
we show that the NER tagger's ability to reference demonstration examples is
generally inadequate. We propose a demonstration and training approach that
effectively addresses these issues. For the first issue, we propose to select
examples by dual similarity, which comprises both semantic similarity and
feature similarity. For the second issue, we propose to train an NER model with
adversarial demonstration such that the model is forced to refer to the
demonstrations when performing the tagging task. We conduct comprehensive
experiments in low-resource NER tasks, and the results demonstrate that our
method outperforms a range of methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用特定预训练编码器和生成模型，结合数据增强技术提升印地语命名实体识别（NER）性能，结果显示检索增强（RA）显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高自然语言处理中命名实体识别（NER）的性能。

Method: 采用印地语特定预训练编码器（MuRIL和XLM - R）和生成模型（Llama - 2 - 7B等），利用从外部相关上下文（如维基百科）检索的数据进行数据增强，对部分模型微调，部分用于少样本NER生成。

Result: 使用RA的语言模型大多优于未使用RA的基线方法；MuRIL和XLM - R在RA下宏F1分数提高；微调的Llama2 - 7B表现更好；部分生成模型在数据增强后表现更佳，不过Llama2 - 70B和lama3 - 70B未适应RA。

Conclusion: RA能显著提升性能，尤其针对低上下文数据，该研究为利用数据增强和预训练模型提升NER性能提供了重要知识。

Abstract: One major challenge in natural language processing is named entity
recognition (NER), which identifies and categorises named entities in textual
input. In order to improve NER, this study investigates a Hindi NER technique
that makes use of Hindi-specific pretrained encoders (MuRIL and XLM-R) and
Generative Models ( Llama-2-7B-chat-hf (Llama2-7B), Llama-2-70B-chat-hf
(Llama2-70B), Llama-3-70B-Instruct (Llama3-70B) and GPT3.5-turbo), and augments
the data with retrieved data from external relevant contexts, notably from
Wikipedia. We have fine-tuned MuRIL, XLM-R and Llama2-7B with and without RA.
However, Llama2-70B, lama3-70B and GPT3.5-turbo are utilised for few-shot NER
generation. Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs)
with Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't
incorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69
and 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71,
respectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B
by a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not
fine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA
well; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval
context. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance,
especially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about
how best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER
performance, particularly in languages with limited resources.

Motivation: 大语言模型上下文学习机制尚不清楚，需探究其原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验，在温和简化假设下分析Transformer块如何将上下文隐式转化为MLP层的低秩权重更新。

Result: 发现自注意力层与MLP堆叠可使Transformer块根据上下文隐式修改MLP层权重。

Abstract: One of the most striking features of Large Language Models (LLM) is their
ability to learn in context. Namely at inference time an LLM is able to learn
new patterns without any additional weight update when these patterns are
presented in the form of examples in the prompt, even if these patterns were
not seen during training. The mechanisms through which this can happen are
still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a
self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly
modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through
theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why
LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show
under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly
transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine
learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large
language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to
support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work
on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been
limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In
this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based
compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous
execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a
long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks
concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark
comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an
efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications,
where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions
that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the
groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking
scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多样本上下文学习常随机选示例，为提升性能并减少计算开销。

Method: 一是结合少量基于相似度选的示例和大量缓存的随机示例；二是用通过k - means聚类从测试样本表示导出的质心选示例替代随机示例。

Result: 实验表明策略始终优于随机选择，超越或匹配最佳选择方法，支持缓存且推理成本最多降低一个数量级。

Conclusion: 可通过调整不同标准选择示例的比例，平衡多样本上下文学习的性能和推理成本。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs
containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning
(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the
input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of
demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)
high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and
(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when
scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for
demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal
computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of
demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a
disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The
second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with
those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via
k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several
datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection
and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting
caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also
show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on
different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Abstract: Within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), fairness evaluation
is often associated with the assessment of bias and reduction of associated
harm. In this regard, the evaluation is usually carried out by using a
benchmark dataset, for a task such as Question Answering, created for the
measurement of bias in the model's predictions along various dimensions,
including gender identity. In our work, we evaluate gender bias in German Large
Language Models (LLMs) using the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering by
Parrish et al. (2022) as a reference. Specifically, the templates in the gender
identity subset of this English dataset were machine translated into German.
The errors in the machine translated templates were then manually reviewed and
corrected with the help of a language expert. We find that manual revision of
the translation is crucial when creating datasets for gender bias evaluation
because of the limitations of machine translation from English to a language
such as German with grammatical gender. Our final dataset is comprised of two
subsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity,
and Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate
several LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the
accuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both
along and against existing social stereotypes.

Conclusion: PromptAL框架能有效解决少样本场景下主动学习的问题，具有良好性能且代码开源。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL
methods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the
decision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently
identifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the
empirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target
distribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal
position. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in
enhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target
distribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of
samples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this,
we propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware
Dynamic Soft \textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}earning).
This framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in
aligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,
thereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first
leverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that
adjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,
based on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation
with both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more
accurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six
in-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior
performance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) built on existing reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF) frameworks typically optimize responses based on
immediate turn-level human preferences. However, this approach falls short in
multi-turn dialogue settings, such as online math tutoring. We propose a method
to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a
lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a
long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The
goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of
guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our
model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of
training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next
utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to
improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring
tasks.

Motivation: 确定结合PLM和主题模型提取的特征对HTC性能是否有益。

Method: 使用PLM和主题模型提取文本特征，通过卷积层处理后结合，再经标签注意力机制得到特定标签的文档表示。

Result: 在三个HTC基准数据集上实验，结合主题模型特征的分类性能低于仅使用PLM特征。

Conclusion: 不应假定结合主题模型提取的特征对文本分类任务有益。

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task
which has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes
from a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various
techniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the
natural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models
along with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an
effective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale
behind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM
captures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic
model obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents
as a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic
model to extract features from text documents which are used to train a
classification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of
the features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in
general. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate
convolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise
attention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by
weighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform
comprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using
the features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification
performance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In
contrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features
extracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed
beneficial.

Abstract: In recent years, various methods have been proposed to evaluate gender bias
in large language models (LLMs). A key challenge lies in the transferability of
bias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when
applied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research
strand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs.
The datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are
accessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight
multilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias
in German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms
and the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work
contributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and
underscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: 不同模型在财务文档审计法规合规性方面各有优势，开源和专有模型都有应用价值。

Abstract: The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process,
stands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made
inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages
from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting
standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall
short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific
legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly
available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance
across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on
comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their
proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis
leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model
demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true
negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless,
proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of
scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.

Result: ICR Probe性能优越，所需参数显著减少。

Conclusion: ICR Score有效可靠，ICR Probe检测效果好，消融研究和案例分析提升了方法的可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their
reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states
predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their
dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this
limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce
a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),
which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We
empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in
distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a
hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer
evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe
achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,
ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying
mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.

Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating
their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science
benchmarks have made progress towards broad **Range**, wide **Reach**, and high
**Rigor**, yet they often face two major challenges: **data leakage risks**
that compromise benchmarking validity, and **evaluation inefficiency** due to
large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the **Ever-Evolving
Science Exam (EESE)**, a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess
scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two
components: 1) a non-public **EESE-Pool** with over 100K expertly constructed
science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+
subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring **Range**, **Reach**,
and **Rigor**, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset **EESE**, sampled
and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations.
Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE
effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific
fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and
forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic
measure of how well foundation models handle science questions. The project

through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection
methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available

covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,
incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate

superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths
compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train
Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which

Abstract: Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a
single model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation
produces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own
understanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such
self-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction
mainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather
than misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of
leveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model
understanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the
generation-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,
SFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation
and unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and
understanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known
in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows
improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously
incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned
training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced
prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the
understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of
co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is
empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics
like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,
which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a
curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces
harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and
improved MLLM generation and understanding.

Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate
diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment
(ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting
ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently
pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.
tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck
challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a
single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we
propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO
optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit
LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by
maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,
theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,
resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value
sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,
outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance
across up to 8 distinct values.

Abstract: For applications that store structured data in relational databases, there is
an impedance mismatch between the flat representations encouraged by relational
data models and the deeply nested information that applications expect to
receive. In this work, we present the graph-relational database model, which
provides a flexible, compositional, and strongly-typed solution to this
"object-relational mismatch." We formally define the graph-relational database
model and present a static and dynamic semantics for queries. In addition, we
discuss the realization of the graph-relational database model in EdgeQL, a
general-purpose SQL-style query language, and the Gel system, which compiles
EdgeQL schemas and queries into PostgreSQL queries. Gel facilitates the kind of
object-shaped data manipulation that is frequently provided inefficiently by
object-relational mapping (ORM) technologies, while achieving most of the
efficiency that comes from require writing complex PostgreSQL queries directly.

Motivation: 现有Python代码类型注解手动编写耗时，过去的类型注解方法存在不足，且都假设代码本身正确。

Method: 通过自分析引导的抽样、统计过滤以及对类型信息的仔细解析和聚合实现。

Result: 能基于程序实际行为生成精确类型注解，提高类型检查召回率，将类型检查变为异常检测，平均性能开销仅30%。

Conclusion: RightTyper克服了现有方法的缺点，是一种有效的Python类型注解方法。

Abstract: Python type annotations bring the benefits of static type checking to the
language. However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and
tedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely
untyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a
number of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer
overly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare
or user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,
degrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,
and even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all
prior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct.
This assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that
have been untyped.
  This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes
these disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations
based on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to
prior approaches. It also turns type checking into anomaly detection, allowing
the type checker to identify corner cases that the programmer can audit for
unintended behavior. RightTyper is also fast and space-efficient, imposing just
30% performance overhead on average. RightTyper achieves these characteristics
by a principled yet pervasive use of sampling--guided by self-profiling--along
with statistical filtering and careful resolution and aggregation of type
information.

Conclusion: 该方法为湍流中主动拉格朗日代理的控制等应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in
mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their
trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the
development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without
incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the
full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because
reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with
the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques
can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the
reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a
surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian
trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions
(with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long
times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes
a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved
dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set
of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees
of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order
model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to
correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the
long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up
a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian
agents in turbulence.

Abstract: Turbulence plays a crucial role in multiphysics applications, including
aerodynamics, fusion, and combustion. Accurately capturing turbulence's
multiscale characteristics is essential for reliable predictions of
multiphysics interactions, but remains a grand challenge even for exascale
supercomputers and advanced deep learning models. The extreme-resolution data
required to represent turbulence, ranging from billions to trillions of grid
points, pose prohibitive computational costs for models based on architectures
like vision transformers. To address this challenge, we introduce a multiscale
hierarchical Turbulence Transformer that reduces sequence length from billions
to a few millions and a novel RingX sequence parallelism approach that enables
scalable long-context learning. We perform scaling and science runs on the
Frontier supercomputer. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance up to
1.1 EFLOPS on 32,768 AMD GPUs, with a scaling efficiency of 94%. To our
knowledge, this is the first AI model for turbulence that can capture
small-scale eddies down to the dissipative range.

Abstract: Robust decision making involves making decisions in the presence of
uncertainty and is often used in critical domains such as healthcare, supply
chains, and finance. Causality plays a crucial role in decision-making as it
predicts the change in an outcome (usually a key performance indicator) due to
a treatment (also called an intervention). To facilitate robust decision making
using causality, this paper proposes three Bayesian approaches of the popular
Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) algorithm, a flexible
semi-parametric double robust estimator, for a probabilistic quantification of
uncertainty in causal effects with binary treatment, and binary and continuous
outcomes. In the first two approaches, the three TMLE models (outcome,
treatment, and fluctuation) are trained sequentially. Since Bayesian
implementation of treatment and outcome yields probabilistic predictions, the
first approach uses mean predictions, while the second approach uses both the
mean and standard deviation of predictions for training the fluctuation model
(targeting step). The third approach trains all three models simultaneously
through a Bayesian network (called BN-TMLE in this paper). The proposed
approaches were demonstrated for two examples with binary and continuous
outcomes and validated against classical implementations. This paper also
investigated the effect of data sizes and model misspecifications on causal
effect estimation using the BN-TMLE approach. Results showed that the proposed
BN-TMLE outperformed classical implementations in small data regimes and
performed similarly in large data regimes.

Abstract: Monitoring for changes in a predictive relationship represented by a fitted
supervised learning model (aka concept drift detection) is a widespread
problem, e.g., for retrospective analysis to determine whether the predictive
relationship was stable over the training data, for prospective analysis to
determine when it is time to update the predictive model, for quality control
of processes whose behavior can be characterized by a predictive relationship,
etc. A general and powerful Fisher score-based concept drift approach has
recently been proposed, in which concept drift detection reduces to detecting
changes in the mean of the model's score vector using a multivariate
exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA). To implement the approach, the
initial data must be split into two subsets. The first subset serves as the
training sample to which the model is fit, and the second subset serves as an
out-of-sample test set from which the MEWMA control limit (CL) is determined.
In this paper, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for computing the CL. Our
bootstrap CL provides much more accurate control of false-alarm rate,
especially when the sample size and/or false-alarm rate is small. It also
allows the entire initial sample to be used for training, resulting in a more
accurate fitted supervised learning model. We show that a standard nested
bootstrap (inner loop accounting for future data variability and outer loop
accounting for training sample variability) substantially underestimates
variability and develop a 632-like correction that appropriately accounts for
this. We demonstrate the advantages with numerical examples.

Abstract: A common approach for handling missing values in data analysis pipelines is
multiple imputation via software packages such as MICE (Van Buuren and
Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) and Amelia (Honaker et al., 2011). These packages
typically assume the data are missing at random (MAR), and impose parametric or
smoothing assumptions upon the imputing distributions in a way that allows
imputation to proceed even if not all missingness patterns have support in the
data. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and induce model
misspecification bias on any analysis performed after such imputation.
  In this paper, we provide a principled alternative. Specifically, we develop
a new characterization for the full data law in graphical models of missing
data. This characterization is constructive, is easily adapted for the
calculation of imputation distributions for both MAR and MNAR (missing not at
random) mechanisms, and is able to handle lack of support for certain patterns
of missingness. We use this characterization to develop a new imputation
algorithm -- Multivariate Imputation via Supported Pattern Recursion (MISPR) --
which uses Gibbs sampling, by analogy with the Multivariate Imputation with
Chained Equations (MICE) algorithm, but which is consistent under both MAR and
MNAR settings, and is able to handle missing data patterns with no support
without imposing additional assumptions beyond those already imposed by the
missing data model itself.
  In simulations, we show MISPR obtains comparable results to MICE when data
are MAR, and superior, less biased results when data are MNAR. Our
characterization and imputation algorithm based on it are a step towards making
principled missing data methods more practical in applied settings, where the
data are likely both MNAR and sufficiently high dimensional to yield missing
data patterns with no support at available sample sizes.

Abstract: Accurate transfer of information across multiple sectors to enhance model

optimization involving a large number of assets in different classes. Within
the framework of factor modeling, we propose a novel data-adaptive multi-task
learning methodology that quantifies and learns the relatedness among the
principal temporal subspaces (spanned by factors) across multiple sectors under
study. This approach not only improves the simultaneous estimation of multiple
factor models but also enhances multi-sector portfolio optimization, which
heavily depends on the accurate recovery of these factor models. Additionally,
a novel and easy-to-implement algorithm, termed projection-penalized principal
component analysis, is developed to accomplish the multi-task learning
procedure. Diverse simulation designs and practical application on daily return
data from Russell 3000 index demonstrate the advantages of multi-task learning
methodology.

Abstract: Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography (mfEIT) represents a
promising biomedical imaging modality that enables the estimation of tissue

present a novel variational network, a model-based learning paradigm that
strategically merges the advantages and interpretability of classical iterative
reconstruction with the power of deep learning. This approach integrates graph
neural networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton
(PRGN) framework. By unrolling the PRGN algorithm, where each iteration
corresponds to a network layer, we leverage the physical insights of nonlinear
model fitting alongside the GNN's capacity to capture inter-frequency
correlations. Notably, the GNN architecture preserves the irregular triangular
mesh structure used in the solution of the nonlinear forward model, enabling
accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations.

Abstract: We present a novel data-driven approach for enhancing gradient reconstruction
in unstructured finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws,
specifically for the 2D Euler equations. Our approach extends previous
structured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes through a modified
DeepONet architecture that incorporates local geometry in the neural network.
The architecture employs local mesh topology to ensure rotation invariance,
while also ensuring first-order constraint on the learned operator. The
training methodology incorporates physics-informed regularization through
entropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter
regularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in
shock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets
solutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial
conditions with periodic boundary conditions, enabling robust generalization to
complex flow configurations or geometries. Validation test cases from the
literature, including challenging geometry configuration, demonstrates
substantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order
finite volume schemes. The method achieves gains of 20-60% in solution accuracy
while enhancing computational efficiency. A convergence study has been conveyed
and reveal improved mesh convergence rates compared to the conventional solver.
The proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than the traditional
second-order finite volume solver, enabling high-fidelity simulations on
coarser grids while preserving the stability and conservation properties
essential for hyperbolic conservation laws. This work is a part of a new
generation of solvers that are built by combining Machine-Learning (ML) tools
with traditional numerical schemes, all while ensuring physical constraint on
the results.

Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum
computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum
systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum
Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem
driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms:
Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT
(NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized
Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT
utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum
classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over
training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We
validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the
2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal
state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our
meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve
as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random
initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring
example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature
crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum
Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms,
achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a
30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum
imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and
practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.

Abstract: Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates
investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is
achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However,
connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity
constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing
increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the
quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement
between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address
this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes
designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both
of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement
requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different
network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases
than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale
quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that
coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with
significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.

constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of
variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where
gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we
introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC
Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates
ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit
pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates
unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt
the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement
outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed
methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based
optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong
results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally
surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth
comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly
shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be
an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific
problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid
predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a
favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.

Result: 智能体持续生成有效的次要嵌入，在Zephyr拓扑上使用合理数量的量子比特，能扩展到中等问题规模并适应不同图结构。

Conclusion: RL可作为QA次要嵌入的灵活通用框架。

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving
combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor
embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum
processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with
increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often
developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult
to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by
treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an
agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem
variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor
embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to
embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two
hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent
consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number
of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed
approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to
different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and
general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.

Conclusion: 该自适应协议及变分方法可用于量子传感策略优化和多代理估计融合。

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable
precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and
electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the
limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and
measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires
optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum
sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum
circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum
channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are
typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning
criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian
inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active
information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for
non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step,
and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum
sensing agents.

Motivation: 现有方法处理局部和全局特征融合时因特征冗余和复杂空间关系面临挑战，格式塔原理在分析局部和全局关系上有优势。

Method: 提出GPI - Net，采用正交集成策略减少冗余信息；用GFA块捕获对应关系中的几何特征；设计DMG块促进不同粒度信息交换。

Result: 在各种具有挑战性的任务上的大量实验表明，GPI - Net性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPI - Net在点云配准高质量对应关系识别中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

which are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that
incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,
offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to
broader social contexts and multimodal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低质量人脸图像会显著降低人脸识别模型性能，影响人脸验证系统准确性和可靠性，需对低质量图像进行预过滤。

Method: 利用归一化面部特征点结合随机森林回归分类器评估图像质量，并将质量评估模块集成到人脸验证过程。

Result: 评估图像质量准确率达96.67%，与ArcFace模型结合时假拒率降低99.7%，余弦相似度得分提高。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效减轻低质量人脸图像影响，优于现有技术，解决实时筛选中分辨率和姿态偏差问题，且保持计算效率。

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文引入SpelkeBench数据集对Spelke对象概念进行基准测试，构建SpelkeNet算法提取Spelke段，其在SpelkeBench上优于监督基线，且Spelke概念对下游应用有实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉中的分割依赖语义和特定类别约定，而发展心理学中人类感知世界的Spelke对象基于类别无关的因果运动关系，或更利于操作和规划任务，故对Spelke对象概念进行研究。

Method: 引入SpelkeBench数据集；构建SpelkeNet视觉世界模型预测未来运动分布，得到运动可供性图和预期位移图；进行“统计反事实探测”定义Spelke段。

Result: SpelkeNet在SpelkeBench上优于监督基线如SegmentAnything (SAM)；Spelke概念在3DEditBench基准的物理对象操作任务中有更好表现。

Conclusion: Spelke对象概念和SpelkeNet方法有效，且Spelke概念对下游应用有实际帮助。

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

Result: 得到三个数据集，保留了脉冲数据的稀疏性和时间精度，为多模态视频理解提供平台。

Conclusion: 该新颖数据集将推动基于脉冲数据的节能、超低功耗视频理解研究，尤其是动作识别任务。

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,
thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will
drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding,
specifically for action recognition tasks using spike-based data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在像素空间降采样和上采样的方法会引入伪影和失真，导致最终图像质量下降，需要改进。

Method: 提出LSSGen框架，在潜在空间使用轻量级潜在上采样器直接进行分辨率缩放，且不改变Transformer或U-Net架构。

Result: 综合评估显示LSSGen显著优于传统缩放方法，生成1024^2图像时TOPIQ分数最多提升246%。

Conclusion: LSSGen在不改变架构的情况下，能提高效率和视觉质量，支持灵活的多分辨率生成。

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges
to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its
weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object
detection.

Motivation: 视觉Transformer自注意力计算开销大，现有令牌减少方法不可逆，需平衡模型性能和计算开销以适配资源受限设备。

Method: 引入ToFe框架，设计预测模块识别重要令牌、近似模块恢复冻结令牌，通过计算预算感知的端到端训练与骨干网络联合优化。

Result: ToFe将LV - ViT模型计算成本降低50%，Top - 1准确率下降不到2%。

Conclusion: ToFe在性能和复杂度之间实现了比现有方法更好的权衡。

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and
instruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited
subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability
and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we
present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework
incorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to
integrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and
mask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative
multi-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset
unification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide
spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation,
detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we
introduce a query enhancement strategy aimed at harnessing the decoding and
generative capabilities inherent in VLLMs. Extensive experiments conducted
across a range of benchmarks in both word-based and sentence-based perception
tasks substantiate the efficacy of our framework. The code will be available at

Result: 在建筑、水体和道路等大尺寸遥感影像数据集上实验，HoliTracer优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HoliTracer能有效从大尺寸遥感影像整体提取矢量地理对象。

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and
data are available in https://github.com/vvangfaye/HoliTracer.

Motivation: 将自适应标签平滑框架从随机裁剪扩展到其他激进的增广类型，研究其有效性。

Method: 将自适应标签平滑框架应用于随机擦除和噪声注入数据增广，并与TrivialAugment方法对比。

Result: 自适应标签平滑在随机擦除中允许更强正则化，但在TrivialAugment方法下益处消失，过度标签平滑损害对常见损坏的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 只有当训练数据分布由有限、同质的图像变换类型主导时，才应应用自适应标签平滑。

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.

TL;DR: 本文关注基于HSI的自主导航，提出在FPGA - SoC上部署DNN - HSI分割处理器的优化技术，压缩模型并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI用于自主导航有前景，但安全关键系统对延迟、资源消耗和安全有严格要求，且DNN和HSI数据处理有挑战，需将ML工作负载转移到边缘平台并进行软硬件协同设计。

Method: 提出一系列优化技术，包括功能软硬件任务分配、硬件感知预处理、ML模型压缩和完整流水线部署。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化技术能有效解决在FPGA - SoC上部署DNN - HSI分割处理器的问题，提升系统性能。

Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.

Conclusion: 所提出的生物学启发方法有效且具有可解释性。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity (e.g., fMRI) bridges
neuroscience and computer vision by decoding neural representations. However,
existing methods often overlook critical brain structure-function
relationships, flattening spatial information and neglecting individual
anatomical variations. To address these issues, we propose (1) a novel sphere
tokenizer that explicitly models fMRI signals as spatially coherent 2D
spherical data on the cortical surface; (2) integration of structural MRI
(sMRI) data, enabling personalized encoding of individual anatomical
variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,
and generalizability across individuals. Experiments demonstrate superior
reconstruction performance compared to SOTA methods, highlighting the
effectiveness and interpretability of our biologically informed approach.

Motivation: 实现可靠的端到端临床报告生成，减轻放射科医生工作量，为临床医生或患者提供二诊意见。

Method: 将专业放射模型创建的中间特征和细粒度分割图通过简单拼接融合到LLaVA的多模态投影层。

Result: 相比仅用中间特征的LLaVA基线，CE F1分数提升0.89%；结合特征和分割图时提升2.77%；比其他两种利用分割的方法F1分数分别提升6.98%和6.28%。

Conclusion: ASaRG不与LLaVA架构其他改进互斥，可结合领域其他进展，输入分割图可追溯报告元素并验证评估依据。

Abstract: Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D多模态大语言模型在处理3D视觉语言任务时，因对3D场景丰富性表示不足而限制了空间感知能力。

Method: 将大语言模型主干与渐进式空间感知方案集成，生成富含位置信息的3D场景嵌入作为视觉提示；引入3D对象距离测量和3D布局编辑任务，构建MODEL数据集。

Result: Spatial 3D - LLM在多种3D视觉语言任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 渐进式空间感知方案能挖掘更深刻的空间信息，提升模型性能。

Abstract: New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决视觉思维链（Visual CoT）训练中现成性能差和缺乏高质量训练数据的问题。

Method: 引入Zebra - CoT数据集，在四类适合草图或视觉推理的任务上进行研究，对Anole - 7B和Bagel - 7B模型进行微调。

Result: 微调Anole - 7B模型测试集准确率提高12%，标准VLM基准评估性能提升达13%；微调Bagel - 7B模型可生成高质量交错视觉推理链。

Conclusion: Zebra - CoT数据集对开发多模态推理能力有效，开源数据集和模型支持视觉CoT的开发和评估。

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

Motivation: 解决现有3D生成方法扩展到地理范围（如建模数千平方公里地球表面）的挑战。

Method: 引入Aerial - Earth3D数据集，提出EarthCrafter框架，通过稀疏解耦潜在扩散进行大规模3D地球生成，架构分离结构和纹理生成，采用双稀疏3D - VAEs和条件感知流匹配模型。

Result: EarthCrafter在超大规模生成中表现显著更好，支持从语义引导城市布局生成到无条件地形合成等多种应用。

Conclusion: 通过数据基础设施和模型架构的双重创新，提出的方法能有效实现大规模3D地球生成，且具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准B - cos模型存在解释图有严重混叠伪影问题，且原公式仅适用于多类设置，而胸部X光分析常需多标签分类，需改进使其适用于临床。

Method: 引入使用FLCPooling (FLC) 和BlurPool (BP) 的抗锯齿策略；将B - cos网络扩展以支持多标签分类。

Result: 改进的$	ext{B - cos}_	ext{FLC}$和$	ext{B - cos}_	ext{BP}$在胸部X光数据集实验中保留了强预测性能，解释无伪影。

Conclusion: 改进后的模型在多标签设置中可用于临床应用。

Abstract: Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the
original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest
X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring
abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce
anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to
significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to
support multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets
demonstrate that the modified $\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and
$\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing
faithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in
multi-label settings. Code available at:

Method: 提出ThinkAct双系统框架，训练多模态大语言模型生成具身推理计划，基于目标完成和轨迹一致性强化动作对齐的视觉奖励，将推理计划压缩为视觉计划潜变量，用于下游动作模型执行动作。

Result: 在具身推理和机器人操作基准测试上的大量实验表明，ThinkAct能实现少样本适应、长周期规划和自我修正行为。

Conclusion: ThinkAct框架在复杂具身AI任务中表现良好，具有一定优势。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Conclusion: 该数据生成管道能训练和验证更复杂准确的心肌运动模型，大幅减少对人工注释的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is
critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven
methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they
rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion
annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation,
we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of
cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.
  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which
incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained
to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the
generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that
simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These
pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT
annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and
validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for
substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical
for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to
computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel
quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion
classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost
modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for
robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference.
Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable
seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on
neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a
real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6\% Top-1 accuracy and
82.4\% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8\% / 81.7\% on the clinical dataset,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair
comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5\,ms
inference latency and 1.7\,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and
energy use by over 94.6\%/98.6\% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing
state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been proposed for solving
inverse scattering problems (ISPs), but most of them heavily rely on data and
suffer from limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, a new solving
scheme is proposed where the solution is iteratively updated following the
updating of the physics-driven neural network (PDNN), the hyperparameters of
which are optimized by minimizing the loss function which incorporates the
constraints from the collected scattered fields and the prior information about
scatterers. Unlike data-driven neural network solvers, PDNN is trained only
requiring the input of collected scattered fields and the computation of
scattered fields corresponding to predicted solutions, thus avoids the
generalization problem. Moreover, to accelerate the imaging efficiency, the
subregion enclosing the scatterers is identified. Numerical and experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high reconstruction accuracy
and strong stability, even when dealing with composite lossy scatterers.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is
essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial
and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain
and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most
existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting
their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the
disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,
they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain
analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework
that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to
enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense
convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency
module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a
novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial
feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ANDI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines
and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and
AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.

Conclusion: PHMDiff作为跨医学成像模态的多尺度图像合成框架，相比其他方法有显著优势。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows,
addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such
as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and
intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis
network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which
employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over
synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.
Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to
speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall
structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process
incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information
consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing
pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images
with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the
contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale
image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows
significant advantages over other methods. The source code is available at

Abstract: Understanding how 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) regulate mRNA translation
is critical for controlling protein expression and designing effective
therapeutic mRNAs. While recent deep learning models have shown promise in
predicting translational efficiency from 5'UTR sequences, most are constrained
by fixed input lengths and limited interpretability. We introduce UTR-STCNet, a
Transformer-based architecture for flexible and biologically grounded modeling
of variable-length 5'UTRs. UTR-STCNet integrates a Saliency-Aware Token
Clustering (SATC) module that iteratively aggregates nucleotide tokens into
multi-scale, semantically meaningful units based on saliency scores. A
Saliency-Guided Transformer (SGT) block then captures both local and distal
regulatory dependencies using a lightweight attention mechanism. This combined
architecture achieves efficient and interpretable modeling without input
truncation or increased computational cost. Evaluated across three benchmark
datasets, UTR-STCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
predicting mean ribosome load (MRL), a key proxy for translational efficiency.
Moreover, the model recovers known functional elements such as upstream AUGs
and Kozak motifs, highlighting its potential for mechanistic insight into
translation regulation.

*Paolo Agliati,André Urbano,Pablo Lanillos,Nasir Ahmad,Marcel van Gerven,Sander Keemink*

TL;DR: 提出一种可扩展的稀疏神经活动尖峰控制方法，能控制线性系统，适用于高维网络和系统，推进对SNNs作为控制器的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脉冲控制在大规模网络中扩展性差、分析性低，当前尖峰控制需输出连续信号、消耗持续能量，因此需新方法。

Method: 结合最优控制和神经科学理论，定义尖峰规则，推导SNN所需连接性。

Result: 成功控制线性系统，在物理约束系统中采用预测控制，方法可扩展到高维网络和系统，有封闭形式数学推导。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了对SNNs作为生物启发控制器的理解，为真实神经元控制和神经形态硬件设计提供见解。

Abstract: Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief
electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets
such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in
connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as
controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events
directly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging
as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical
tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering
the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal,
necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we
circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method
for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we
take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define
a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system
closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity
for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show
that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and
the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream
system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to
both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we
maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the
network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the
understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight
into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in
neuromorphic hardware design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能虽有望带来生产力增长，但可能减少入门级机会，引发对后代技能获取的担忧，因此研究先进自动化对知识代际传递的影响。

Method: 开发模型进行分析，并进行粗略计算。

Result: 自动化入门级任务有即时生产力提升，但会损害长期增长，AI副驾驶可部分缓解负面影响，但可能降低年轻员工实践学习的动力。

Conclusion: 除非AI创造新的入门级岗位或大幅提高经济的创新率，否则不能自动带来持续的生产力增长。

Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have fueled predictions of
unprecedented productivity growth. Yet, by enabling senior workers to perform
more tasks on their own, AI may inadvertently reduce entry-level opportunities,
raising concerns about how future generations will acquire essential skills. In
this paper, I develop a model to examine how advanced automation affects the
intergenerational transmission of knowledge. The analysis reveals that
automating entry-level tasks yields immediate productivity gains but can
undermine long-run growth by eroding the skills of subsequent generations.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that AI-driven entry-level automation
could reduce U.S. long-term annual growth by approximately 0.05 to 0.35
percentage points, depending on its scale. I also demonstrate that AI co-pilots
- systems that democratize access to expertise previously acquired only through
hands-on experience - can partially mitigate these negative effects. However,
their introduction is not always beneficial: by providing expert insights,
co-pilots may inadvertently diminish younger workers' incentives to invest in
hands-on learning. These findings cast doubt on the optimistic view that AI
will automatically lead to sustained productivity growth, unless it either
generates new entry-level roles or significantly boosts the economy's
underlying innovation rate.

Motivation: 经济学文献通常默认调查数据数值类别代表等心理间隔，本文要系统检验该假设。

Method: 开发通用框架量化放松线性假设结果被推翻的容易程度，用原始实验数据研究，并复制顶级经济学期刊80多篇论文超30000个系数估计。

Result: 受访者解读有轻微非线性，系数符号对轻微非线性较稳健，但统计推断和相对效应量估计不可靠。

Conclusion: 该问题对政策应用有挑战，且普遍存在于其他基于调查的研究中。

Abstract: Economists routinely use survey measures of, for example, risk preferences,
trust, political attitudes, or wellbeing. The literature generally treats
numerical response categories as if they represent equal psychological
intervals. We provide the first systematic test of this assumption, developing
a general framework to quantify how easily results can be overturned when this
linearity assumption is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that
respondents interpret survey scales in ways that do deviate from linearity, but
only mildly. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 30,000+
coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics
journals. Replicated coefficient signs are remarkably robust to mild departures
from linear scale-use. However, statistical inference and estimates of relative
effect magnitudes become unreliable, even under modest departures from
linearity. This is especially problematic for policy applications. We show that
these concerns generalise to many other widely used survey-based constructs.

Method: 研究随机抽取目标函数的优化（贝叶斯优化），开发处理随机输入到随机函数的数学工具，刻画非平稳各向同性协方差核。

Result: 分布视角可解释高维优化的可预测进展，为梯度下降的最优步长控制提供见解。

Conclusion: 数据的可交换性假设可产生机器学习中的随机目标函数，并分析其景观。

Abstract: This PhD thesis presents a distributional view of optimization in place of a
worst-case perspective. We motivate this view with an investigation of the
failure point of classical optimization. Subsequently we consider the
optimization of a randomly drawn objective function. This is the setting of
Bayesian Optimization. After a review of Bayesian optimization we outline how
such a distributional view may explain predictable progress of optimization in
high dimension. It further turns out that this distributional view provides
insights into optimal step size control of gradient descent. To enable these
results, we develop mathematical tools to deal with random input to random
functions and a characterization of non-stationary isotropic covariance
kernels. Finally, we outline how assumptions about the data, specifically
exchangability, can lead to random objective functions in machine learning and
analyze their landscape.

Abstract: The 11th Society of Petroleum Engineers Comparative Solution Project
(shortened SPE11 herein) benchmarked simulation tools for geological carbon
dioxide (CO$_2$) storage. A total of 45 groups from leading research
institutions and industry across the globe signed up to participate, with 18
ultimately contributing valid results that were included in the comparative
study reported here.
  This paper summarizes the SPE11. A comprehensive introduction and qualitative
discussion of the submitted data are provided, together with an overview of
online resources for accessing the full depth of data. A global metric for
analyzing the relative distance between submissions is proposed and used to
conduct a quantitative analysis of the submissions. This analysis attempts to
statistically resolve the key aspects influencing the variability between
submissions.
  The study shows that the major qualitative variation between the submitted
results is related to thermal effects, dissolution-driven convective mixing,
and resolution of facies discontinuities. Moreover, a strong dependence on grid
resolution is observed across all three versions of the SPE11. However, our
quantitative analysis suggests that the observed variations are predominantly
influenced by factors not documented in the technical responses provided by the
participants. We therefore identify that unreported variations due to human
choices within the process of setting up, conducting, and reporting on the
simulations underlying each SPE11 submission are at least as impactful as the
computational choices reported.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数值求解亥姆霍兹方程面临计算和内存挑战，需要高效求解方法。

Method: 引入PICNO，将背景波场和速度模型作为输入函数空间，生成散射波场作为输出函数空间，并将PDE约束集成到训练过程。

Result: PICNO在有限训练样本下能进行高分辨率合理准确的预测，在预测高频波场方面比CNO有显著改进。

Conclusion: PICNO的特性和改进对后续波形反演很重要。

Abstract: Solving the wave equation is fundamental for geophysical applications.
However, numerical solutions of the Helmholtz equation face significant
computational and memory challenges. Therefore, we introduce a physics-informed
convolutional neural operator (PICNO) to solve the Helmholtz equation
efficiently. The PICNO takes both the background wavefield corresponding to a
homogeneous medium and the velocity model as input function space, generating
the scattered wavefield as the output function space. Our workflow integrates
PDE constraints directly into the training process, enabling the neural
operator to not only fit the available data but also capture the underlying
physics governing wave phenomena. PICNO allows for high-resolution reasonably
accurate predictions even with limited training samples, and it demonstrates
significant improvements over a purely data-driven convolutional neural
operator (CNO), particularly in predicting high-frequency wavefields. These
features and improvements are important for waveform inversion down the road.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 法国图尔大学研究团队在Biblissima支持下开放15世纪音乐XML语料库，本文聚焦开发转换工具将CMME文件转换为MEI格式，开发了转换器并实现向MEI CMN的转换，赋予语料库新生命，提供新编码编辑管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMME文件编码格式及编辑工具未更新，需开发转换工具使其符合更现代的音乐编码标准MEI。

Method: 组织专家研讨会，在开源渲染库Verovio中开发转换器，实现从CMME到MEI mensural及MEI CMN的转换。

Result: 成功开发转换器，实现CMME文件到MEI mensural和MEI CMN的转换，可在常见刻版软件中加载且信息损失小。

Conclusion: 转换工具赋予现有CMME文件语料库新生命，为记谱音乐的编码和编辑提供了新途径。

Abstract: The Ricercar Lab - the musicological research team at the Center for advanced
Studies in the Renaissance at the University of Tours - has decided to make
available in open access, thanks to the support of the French digital
infrastructure Biblissima, a large corpus of about 3500 XML files of 15th-c.
music. This corpus was produced by the German musicologist Clemens Goldberg who
encoded since 2010 onwards the musical content of 34 major 15th-c. music
manuscripts and other complementary files, in order to offer on his
foundation's website PDF files of complete collections of works by Du Fay,
Binchois, Okeghem, Busnoys and most of their major contemporaries, focusing on
their secular output. This corpus was encoded in an XML format named CMME
(Computerized Mensural Music Editing), specifically conceived for mensural
music by Theodor Dumitrescu in the 2000s, together with editorial and
publication tools which have not been updated since then. This article focuses
on the development of a set of conversion tools for these CMME files to meet
more up-to-date standards of music encoding, namely MEI. A workshop was
organised in September 2024 at the Campus Condorcet in Paris, gathering experts
with a wide range of knowledge on mensural music notation, XML formats and
programming. A converter was developped directly in the open-source rendering
library Verovio, allowing the conversion from CMME to MEI mensural. A
conversion to MEI CMN was implemented afterwards, enabling to load these files
in common engraving softwares such as MuseScore with minimal loss of
information. With the availability of a direct import of CMME-XML into Verovio,
the corpus of existing CMME files gets a new life. Furthermore, since the
stand-alone CMME editor still works fine and no alternative is available yet
for native MEI, the converter offers a new pipeline for encoding and editing
mensural music.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恢复因带宽限制丢失的高频分量对资源有限的电信和高保真音频等应用至关重要。

Method: 引入基于非线性动力系统的七种新判别器，判别器核心用深度卷积减少参数，引导基于ConformerNeXt的复值生成器。

Result: 在六项客观评估指标和五人参与的主观测试中，NDSI - BWE达到带宽扩展新的最优水平。

Conclusion: NDSI - BWE在带宽扩展领域表现优异，建立了新的最优水平。

Abstract: Recovering high-frequency components lost to bandwidth constraints is crucial
for applications ranging from telecommunications to high-fidelity audio on
limited resources. We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width
Extension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired by
nonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: a
Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity to
initial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale Recurrence
Discriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-Scale
Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variant
scale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution Poincar\'e Plot Discriminator
(MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-Period
Discriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution Amplitude
Discriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) for
capturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics. By using depth-wise
convolution at the core of the convolutional block with in each discriminators,
NDSI-BWE attains an eight-times parameter reduction. These seven discriminators
guide a complex-valued ConformerNeXt based genetor with a dual stream
Lattice-Net based architecture for simultaneous refinement of magnitude and
phase. The genertor leverage the transformer based conformer's global
dependency modeling and ConvNeXt block's local temporal modeling capability.
Across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective based texts comprises of
five human judges, NDSI-BWE establishes a new SoTA in BWE.

Motivation: 现有说话人分割系统在不同数据集上错误率差异大，且系统间比较需遵循最佳实践，缺乏统一基准。

Method: 提出SDBench基准套件，集成13个数据集并提供内置工具；构建SpeakerKit系统，利用SDBench进行消融研究。

Result: SpeakerKit比Pyannote v3快9.6倍且错误率相当；对6个先进系统进行基准测试，揭示了准确性和速度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: SDBench能实现可重复评估，便于新系统集成，有助于说话人分割系统的性能分析。

Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in
error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and
domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of
best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for
apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization
Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets
with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker
diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench
enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time.
To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference
efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid
execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than
Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6
state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI
API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

Motivation: 现有SED算法多在封闭集假设下工作，语言驱动的零样本SED因缺乏细粒度对齐和跨模态特征融合，性能不佳。

Method: 将SED表述为帧级检索任务，引入双流解码器解耦事件识别和时间定位，提出推理时注意力掩码策略。

Result: 在AudioSet Strong数据集上，开放词汇设置超CLAP方法7.8 PSDS，封闭集设置超基线6.9 PSDS；在DESED跨数据集零样本评估中，PSDS1得分42.2，超有监督CRNN基线。

Conclusion: DASM能有效平衡定位准确性和对新类别的泛化能力。

Abstract: Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a
closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined
classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by
exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from
satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature
fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a
query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries.
DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are
matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support
this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly
decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event
decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound
events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies
for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking
strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel
classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments
on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances
localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming
CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in
the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot
evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the
supervised CRNN baseline. The project page is available at

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在音频生成质量和空间感知准确性方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 所提出的文本到多源双耳音频生成级联方法有效，在相关指标上表现出色。

Abstract: Most existing text-to-audio (TTA) generation methods produce mono outputs,
neglecting essential spatial information for immersive auditory experiences. To
address this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource
binaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control.
First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a
structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a
pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with
varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into
binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data
from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times,
resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality
and spatial perceptual accuracy.

Abstract: We study a distributed computation problem in the presence of Byzantine
workers where a central node wishes to solve a task that is divided into
independent sub-tasks, each of which needs to be solved correctly. The
distributed computation is achieved by allocating the sub-task computation
across workers with replication, as well as solving a small number of sub-tasks
locally, which we wish to minimize due to it being expensive. For a general
balanced job allocation, we propose a protocol that successfully solves for all
sub-tasks using an optimal number of local computations under no communication
constraints. Closed-form performance results are presented for cyclic
allocations. Furthermore, we propose a modification to this protocol to improve
communication efficiency without compromising on the amount of local
computation.

the Hausdorff geometry of the space of real algebraic varieties of a given

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) involves activating a set of initially asleep
robots as quickly as possible, starting from a single awake robot. Once
activated, a robot can assist in waking up other robots. Each active robot
moves at unit speed. The objective is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the time
required to activate the last robot. A key performance measure is the wake-up
ratio, defined as the maximum time needed to activate any number of robots in
any primary positions. This work focuses on the geometric (Euclidean) version
of FTP in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $\ell_p$ norm, where the initial distance
between each asleep robot and the single active robot is at most 1. For
$(\mathbb{R}^2, \ell_2)$, we improve the previous upper bound of 4.62 ([7],
CCCG 2024) to 4.31. Note that it is known that 3.82 is a lower bound for the
wake-up ratio. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, we propose a new strategy that achieves a
wake-up ratio of 12 for $(\mathbb{R}^3, \ell_1)$ and 12.76 for $(\mathbb{R}^3,
\ell_2)$, improving upon the previous bounds of 13 and $13\sqrt{3}$,
respectively, reported in [2].

*Hanwen Liu,Yifeng Gong,Zuwei Yan,Zeheng Zhuang,Jiaxuan Lu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出多尺度时空图Mamba（MSGM）框架用于基于EEG的情绪识别，在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于EEG的情绪识别方法难以捕捉多尺度时空动态，且难以保证实时应用的计算效率，存在简化时间粒度和空间层次的问题，限制了准确性。

Method: 提出MSGM框架，集成多窗口时间分割、双峰空间图建模，并通过Mamba架构进行高效融合，利用多深度图卷积网络和令牌嵌入融合模块，结合Mamba的状态空间建模。

Result: 仅用一个MSST - Mamba层，MSGM在SEED、THU - EP和FACED数据集上超越该领域领先方法，在独立于受试者的情绪分类中表现优于基线，在NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX上实现鲁棒准确性和毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: MSGM框架有效解决了现有基于EEG情绪识别方法的问题，具有良好的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition struggles with capturing multi-scale
spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring computational efficiency for real-time
applications. Existing methods often oversimplify temporal granularity and
spatial hierarchies, limiting accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we
propose the Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba (MSGM), a novel framework
integrating multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling,
and efficient fusion via the Mamba architecture. By segmenting EEG signals
across diverse temporal scales and constructing global-local graphs with
neuroanatomical priors, MSGM effectively captures fine-grained emotional
fluctuations and hierarchical brain connectivity. A multi-depth Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) and token embedding fusion module, paired with
Mamba's state-space modeling, enable dynamic spatiotemporal interaction at
linear complexity. Notably, with just one MSST-Mamba layer, MSGM surpasses
leading methods in the field on the SEED, THU-EP, and FACED datasets,
outperforming baselines in subject-independent emotion classification while
achieving robust accuracy and millisecond-level inference on the NVIDIA Jetson
Xavier NX.

Method: 提出AutoMAT框架，集成大语言模型、自动化CALPHAD模拟和AI驱动搜索。

Result: 在轻高强钛合金案例中识别出密度低8.1%且屈服强度相当的合金；在高屈服强度高熵合金案例中使屈服强度提升28.2%，并将发现周期从数年缩短至数周。

Conclusion: AutoMAT是可扩展且通用的下一代合金设计平台。

Abstract: Alloy discovery is central to advancing modern industry but remains hindered
by the vastness of compositional design space and the costly validation. Here,
we present AutoMAT, a hierarchical and autonomous framework grounded in and
validated by experiments, which integrates large language models, automated
CALPHAD-based simulations, and AI-driven search to accelerate alloy design.
Spanning the entire pipeline from ideation to validation, AutoMAT achieves high
efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability without the need for manually
curated large datasets. In a case study targeting a lightweight, high-strength
alloy, AutoMAT identifies a titanium alloy with 8.1% lower density and
comparable yield strength relative to the state-of-the-art reference, achieving
the highest specific strength among all comparisons. In a second case targeting
high-yield-strength high-entropy alloys, AutoMAT achieves a 28.2% improvement
in yield strength over the base alloy. In both cases, AutoMAT reduces the
discovery timeline from years to weeks, illustrating its potential as a
scalable and versatile platform for next-generation alloy design.

Motivation: 传统非晶合金设计依赖经验法则和大量尝试，成本高、效率低，无法在巨大材料空间有效采样

Method: 构建材料网络，通过分析不同年份合成的非晶合金构建动态网络以追踪合金发现历史

Result: 网络拓扑揭示了传统表格数据表示中隐藏的材料候选者，发现过去设计的创新材料被编码在网络中，且材料网络与现实世界网络有物理相似性

Conclusion: 研究为智能材料设计，特别是复杂合金设计开辟了新道路

Abstract: Designing high-performance amorphous alloys is demanding for various
applications. But this process intensively relies on empirical laws and
unlimited attempts. The high-cost and low-efficiency nature of the traditional
strategies prevents effective sampling in the enormous material space. Here, we
propose material networks to accelerate the discovery of binary and ternary
amorphous alloys. The network topologies reveal hidden material candidates that
were obscured by traditional tabular data representations. By scrutinizing the
amorphous alloys synthesized in different years, we construct dynamical
material networks to track the history of the alloy discovery. We find that
some innovative materials designed in the past were encoded in the networks,
demonstrating their predictive power in guiding new alloy design. These
material networks show physical similarities with several real-world networks
in our daily lives. Our findings pave a new way for intelligent materials
design, especially for complex alloys.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: 本文展示了使用不确定性感知架构结合主动学习和物理模拟代码构建高效数据集以生成数据驱动代理模型的原理验证，应用于托卡马克等离子体湍流输运问题并取得一定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高效数据集用于数据驱动代理模型生成，针对等离子体湍流输运问题，以小数据集模拟昂贵代码。

Method: 使用SNGP架构进行分类、BNN - NCP架构进行回归，结合主动学习技术和物理模拟代码作为数据标注器。

Result: 经过45次主动学习迭代，模型在独立测试集上F1分类性能约0.8，R²回归性能约0.75，达到与之前ADEPT管道相同性能和效率。

Conclusion: 整体技术虽改进率下降快，但组件可升级和推广到其他代理建模应用。

Abstract: This work demonstrates a proof-of-principle for using uncertainty-aware
architectures, in combination with active learning techniques and an
in-the-loop physics simulation code as a data labeller, to construct efficient
datasets for data-driven surrogate model generation. Building off of a previous
proof-of-principle successfully demonstrating training set reduction on static
pre-labelled datasets, using the ADEPT framework, this strategy was applied
again to the plasma turbulent transport problem within tokamak fusion plasmas,
specifically the QuaLiKiz quasilinear electrostatic gyrokinetic turbulent
transport code. While QuaLiKiz provides relatively fast evaluations, this study
specifically targeted small datasets to serve as a proxy for more expensive
codes, such as CGYRO or GENE. The newly implemented algorithm uses the SNGP
architecture for the classification component of the problem and the BNN-NCP
architecture for the regression component, training models for all turbulent
modes (ITG, TEM, ETG) and all transport fluxes ($Q_e$, $Q_i$, $\Gamma_e$,
$\Gamma_i$, and $\Pi_i$) described by the general QuaLiKiz output. With 45
active learning iterations, moving from a small initial training set of
$10^{2}$ to a final set of $10^{4}$, the resulting models reached a $F_1$
classification performance of ~0.8 and a $R^2$ regression performance of ~0.75
on an independent test set across all outputs. This extrapolates to reaching
the same performance and efficiency as the previous ADEPT pipeline, although on
a problem with 1 extra input dimension. While the improvement rate achieved in
this implementation diminishes faster than expected, the overall technique is
formulated with components that can be upgraded and generalized to many
surrogate modeling applications beyond plasma turbulent transport predictions.

Abstract: This work presents predictive hydrodynamic simulations empowered by
artificial intelligence (AI) for laser driven implosion experiments, taking the
double-cone ignition (DCI) scheme as an example. A Transformer-based deep
learning model MULTI-Net is established to predict implosion features according
to laser waveforms and target radius. A Physics-Informed Decoder (PID) is
proposed for high-dimensional sampling, significantly reducing the prediction
errors compared to Latin hypercube sampling. Applied to DCI experiments
conducted on the SG-II Upgrade facility, the MULTI-Net model is able to predict
the implosion dynamics measured by the x-ray streak camera. It is found that an
effective laser absorption factor about 65\% is suitable for the
one-dimensional simulations of the DCI-R10 experiments. For shot 33, the mean
implosion velocity and collided plasma density reached 195 km/s and 117 g/cc,
respectively. This study demonstrates a data-driven AI framework that enhances
the prediction ability of simulations for complicated laser fusion experiments.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级PPFL框架DP2Guard，增强隐私和鲁棒性，降低成本并有效防御攻击。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒性增强的PPFL方案存在通信计算开销大、单策略防御不足的问题，需改进。

Method: 采用轻量级梯度掩码机制，提出混合防御策略提取特征识别恶意梯度，采用基于信任分数的自适应聚合方案，用区块链记录结果和分数。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实验表明，DP2Guard能有效防御四种高级投毒攻击，保证隐私并降低开销。

Conclusion: DP2Guard可有效增强PPFL的隐私和鲁棒性，同时降低通信和计算成本。

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) has emerged as a secure
distributed Machine Learning (ML) paradigm that aggregates locally trained
gradients without exposing raw data. To defend against model poisoning threats,
several robustness-enhanced PPFL schemes have been proposed by integrating
anomaly detection. Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: (1) the
reliance on heavyweight encryption techniques results in substantial
communication and computation overhead; and (2) single-strategy defense
mechanisms often fail to provide sufficient robustness against adaptive
adversaries. To overcome these challenges, we propose DP2Guard, a lightweight
PPFL framework that enhances both privacy and robustness. DP2Guard leverages a
lightweight gradient masking mechanism to replace costly cryptographic
operations while ensuring the privacy of local gradients. A hybrid defense
strategy is proposed, which extracts gradient features using singular value
decomposition and cosine similarity, and applies a clustering algorithm to
effectively identify malicious gradients. Additionally, DP2Guard adopts a trust
score-based adaptive aggregation scheme that adjusts client weights according
to historical behavior, while blockchain records aggregated results and trust
scores to ensure tamper-proof and auditable training. Extensive experiments
conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that DP2Guard effectively defends
against four advanced poisoning attacks while ensuring privacy with reduced
communication and computation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BAC是Web应用中严重且普遍的漏洞，但在自动化测试中因缺乏可靠预言机和生成有效攻击请求困难而未得到充分探索。

Method: BACFuzz结合大语言模型引导的参数选择、运行时反馈和基于SQL的预言机检查，使用轻量级插桩捕获运行时信息指导测试生成，分析后端SQL查询验证非法输入是否流入受保护操作。

Result: 在20个真实Web应用上评估，检测到17个已知问题中的16个，发现26个未知BAC漏洞，误报率低。

Conclusion: BACFuzz能有效检测PHP Web应用中的BAC漏洞，相关问题已披露，工件将公开。

Abstract: Broken Access Control (BAC) remains one of the most critical and widespread
vulnerabilities in web applications, allowing attackers to access unauthorized
resources or perform privileged actions. Despite its severity, BAC is
underexplored in automated testing due to key challenges: the lack of reliable
oracles and the difficulty of generating semantically valid attack requests. We
introduce BACFuzz, the first gray-box fuzzing framework specifically designed
to uncover BAC vulnerabilities, including Broken Object-Level Authorization
(BOLA) and Broken Function-Level Authorization (BFLA) in PHP-based web
applications. BACFuzz combines LLM-guided parameter selection with runtime
feedback and SQL-based oracle checking to detect silent authorization flaws. It
employs lightweight instrumentation to capture runtime information that guides
test generation, and analyzes backend SQL queries to verify whether
unauthorized inputs flow into protected operations. Evaluated on 20 real-world
web applications, including 15 CVE cases and 2 known benchmarks, BACFuzz
detects 16 of 17 known issues and uncovers 26 previously unknown BAC
vulnerabilities with low false positive rates. All identified issues have been
responsibly disclosed, and artifacts will be publicly released.

Motivation: 以往文本攻击难以保持文本语义和相似度，要设计新攻击方法利用系统透明度信任来误导分类器。

Method: 采用聚焦解释的评分方法确定关键令牌，进行简单字符级修改，最小化原文本与新文本差异并生成类似良性的对抗性解释。

Result: 在七个NLP模型和三个解释模型上测试，平均改变两个字符就能显著降低当前深度学习模型预测准确率。

Conclusion: AdvChar能有效误导可解释NLP系统的分类器，且对文本改动小。

Abstract: Studies have shown that machine learning systems are vulnerable to
adversarial examples in theory and practice. Where previous attacks have
focused mainly on visual models that exploit the difference between human and
machine perception, text-based models have also fallen victim to these attacks.
However, these attacks often fail to maintain the semantic meaning of the text
and similarity. This paper introduces AdvChar, a black-box attack on
Interpretable Natural Language Processing Systems, designed to mislead the
classifier while keeping the interpretation similar to benign inputs, thus
exploiting trust in system transparency. AdvChar achieves this by making less
noticeable modifications to text input, forcing the deep learning classifier to
make incorrect predictions and preserve the original interpretation. We use an
interpretation-focused scoring approach to determine the most critical tokens
that, when changed, can cause the classifier to misclassify the input. We apply
simple character-level modifications to measure the importance of tokens,
minimizing the difference between the original and new text while generating
adversarial interpretations similar to benign ones. We thoroughly evaluated
AdvChar by testing it against seven NLP models and three interpretation models
using benchmark datasets for the classification task. Our experiments show that
AdvChar can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of current deep
learning models by altering just two characters on average in input samples.

Result: SVAgent能有效抑制幻觉和随机答案影响，SVA的准确性和一致性等关键指标优于现有框架。

Conclusion: SVAgent可成功集成到主流集成电路漏洞评估框架，在真实工程设计环境中具有实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Verification using SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) is one of the most popular
methods for detecting circuit design vulnerabilities. However, with the
globalization of integrated circuit design and the continuous upgrading of
security requirements, the SVA development model has exposed major limitations.
It is not only inefficient in development, but also unable to effectively deal
with the increasing number of security vulnerabilities in modern complex
integrated circuits. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes an
innovative SVA automatic generation framework SVAgent. SVAgent introduces a
requirement decomposition mechanism to transform the original complex
requirements into a structured, gradually solvable fine-grained problem-solving
chain. Experiments have shown that SVAgent can effectively suppress the
influence of hallucinations and random answers, and the key evaluation
indicators such as the accuracy and consistency of the SVA are significantly
better than existing frameworks. More importantly, we successfully integrated
SVAgent into the most mainstream integrated circuit vulnerability assessment
framework and verified its practicality and reliability in a real engineering
design environment.

Result: 增强后的大语言模型能产生准确一致的解释，增强提示比基线性能提升超20%。

Conclusion: 增强后的大语言模型可作为NIDS中解释恶意流分类的有价值补充工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces eX-NIDS, a framework designed to enhance
interpretability in flow-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). In our proposed framework, flows
labelled as malicious by NIDS are initially processed through a module called
the Prompt Augmenter. This module extracts contextual information and Cyber
Threat Intelligence (CTI)-related knowledge from these flows. This enriched,
context-specific data is then integrated with an input prompt for an LLM,
enabling it to generate detailed explanations and interpretations of why the
flow was identified as malicious by NIDS. We compare the generated
interpretations against a Basic-Prompt Explainer baseline, which does not
incorporate any contextual information into the LLM's input prompt. Our
framework is quantitatively evaluated using the Llama 3 and GPT-4 models,
employing a novel evaluation method tailored for natural language explanations,
focusing on their correctness and consistency. The results demonstrate that
augmented LLMs can produce accurate and consistent explanations, serving as
valuable complementary tools in NIDS to explain the classification of malicious
flows. The use of augmented prompts enhances performance by over 20% compared
to the Basic-Prompt Explainer.

Motivation: T2I生成模型易产生有害内容，现有自动化红队方法在扩展性、多样性和整体有效性方面存在局限，需要改进。

Method: 提出DREAM框架，直接建模目标系统问题提示的概率分布，借鉴基于能量的模型将目标转化为简单易处理的目标，引入GC - SPSA优化算法。

Conclusion: DREAM框架是一种有效的可扩展红队框架，能从给定T2I系统中自动发现多样的问题提示，提升了T2I系统安全性评估和改进的效果。

Abstract: Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,
text-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing
harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious
concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which
aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs
from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential
external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly
recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before
real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often
treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which
limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to
automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.
Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly
models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic
prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and
diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve
this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw
inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple
and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient
optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long
and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is
validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9
state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I
models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.

Method: 提出两种基于白盒优化的攻击针对不同深度内部状态，通过两阶段反转过程避免局部极小值；利用源模型和派生模型的可迁移性将白盒攻击扩展到黑盒场景；引入基于生成的攻击将反转视为翻译任务。

Conclusion: 评估的四种实际防御措施不能完全防止内部状态反转，为未来缓解设计提供结论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines,
yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research
proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to
ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner
neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which
are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization
challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this
work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that
significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of
inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box
optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These
attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,
through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack
under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability
between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a
generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing
an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and
long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs
validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token
long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1
token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate
four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion
and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.

Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) realization requires AI-native orchestration
architectures to efficiently and intelligently handle heterogeneous user
requirements. To achieve this, network slicing is evolving towards a more
user-centric digital transformation, focusing on architectures that incorporate
native intelligence to enable self-managed connectivity in an integrated and
isolated manner. However, these initiatives face the challenge of validating
their results in production environments, particularly those utilizing
ML-enabled orchestration, as they are often tested in local networks or
laboratory simulations. This paper proposes a large-scale validation method
using a network slicing prediction model to forecast latency using Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) and basic ML algorithms embedded within an NS architecture,
evaluated in real large-scale production testbeds. It measures and compares the
performance of different DNNs and ML algorithms, considering a distributed
database application deployed as a network slice over two large-scale

TL;DR: 研究评估五种贝叶斯深度学习方法对对流起始临近预报的概率和不确定性预测，对比确定性残差神经网络，部分贝叶斯方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估五种贝叶斯深度学习方法在0 - 1小时对流起始临近预报中的概率和不确定性预测效果，与确定性残差神经网络对比。

Method: 使用GOES - 16卫星红外观测数据，通过评估概率预报校准情况和不确定性分离大小误差预报的能力来评估各方法。

Result: 多数贝叶斯深度学习方法概率预报优于确定性ResNet，初始权重集成+MC dropout表现最佳；贝叶斯ResNet集成在较长提前时间表现差；采用贝叶斯 - MOPED ResNet集成可提升预报技巧；初始权重集成+MC dropout在晴空区域部分对流起始事件预报技巧更好，但在无对流起始的晴空和砧云区域泛化性较差。

Conclusion: 部分贝叶斯深度学习方法在对流起始临近预报中表现良好，可有效进行概率和不确定性预测，但不同方法有各自优缺点。

Abstract: This study evaluated the probability and uncertainty forecasts of five
recently proposed Bayesian deep learning methods relative to a deterministic
residual neural network (ResNet) baseline for 0-1 h convective initiation (CI)
nowcasting using GOES-16 satellite infrared observations. Uncertainty was
assessed by how well probabilistic forecasts were calibrated and how well
uncertainty separated forecasts with large and small errors. Most of the
Bayesian deep learning methods produced probabilistic forecasts that
outperformed the deterministic ResNet, with one, the initial-weights ensemble +
Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, an ensemble of deterministic ResNets with different
initial weights to start training and dropout activated during inference,
producing the most skillful and well-calibrated forecasts. The initial-weights
ensemble + MC dropout benefited from generating multiple solutions that more
thoroughly sampled the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble was the
only one that performed worse than the deterministic ResNet at longer lead
times, likely due to the challenge of optimizing a larger number of parameters.
To address this issue, the Bayesian-MOPED (MOdel Priors with Empirical Bayes
using Deep neural network) ResNet ensemble was adopted, and it enhanced
forecast skill by constraining the hypothesis search near the deterministic
ResNet hypothesis. All Bayesian methods demonstrated well-calibrated
uncertainty and effectively separated cases with large and small errors. In
case studies, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout demonstrated better
forecast skill than the Bayesian-MOPED ensemble and the deterministic ResNet on
selected CI events in clear-sky regions. However, the initial-weights ensemble
+ MC dropout exhibited poorer generalization in clear-sky and anvil cloud
regions without CI occurrence compared to the deterministic ResNet and
Bayesian-MOPED ensemble.

TL;DR: 研究提出双字典框架解决放射组学特征与BI - RADS术语间差距，用于区分三阴和非三阴乳腺癌，最佳模型准确率0.83，证实已知生物标志物并发现新关联，提升AI模型透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于放射组学的AI模型缺乏可解释性，限制临床应用，需解决放射组学特征与标准化BI - RADS术语间的差距。

Method: 创建临床信息特征解释字典（CIFID），将56个放射组学特征映射到BI - RADS描述符；应用框架对1549名患者的动态对比增强MRI数据进行三阴和非三阴乳腺癌分类；使用27种特征选择方法训练27个机器学习分类器；用SHAP解释预测并生成数据驱动特征解释字典（DDFID）。

Result: 最佳模型结合VIF选择和Extra Trees分类器，平均交叉验证准确率0.83；关键预测特征与临床知识相符，高球形度和低繁忙度与三阴乳腺癌相关。

Conclusion: 双字典方法（BM1.0）增强了AI模型透明度，支持将放射组学特征融入常规乳腺癌诊断和个性化护理。

Abstract: Radiomics-based AI models show promise for breast cancer diagnosis but often
lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption. This study addresses the gap
between radiomic features (RF) and the standardized BI-RADS lexicon by
proposing a dual-dictionary framework. First, a Clinically-Informed Feature
Interpretation Dictionary (CIFID) was created by mapping 56 RFs to BI-RADS
descriptors (shape, margin, internal enhancement) through literature and expert
review. The framework was applied to classify triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) versus non-TNBC using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from a
multi-institutional cohort of 1,549 patients. We trained 27 machine learning
classifiers with 27 feature selection methods. SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) were used to interpret predictions and generate a complementary
Data-Driven Feature Interpretation Dictionary (DDFID) for 52 additional RFs.
The best model, combining Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) selection with Extra
Trees Classifier, achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of 0.83. Key
predictive RFs aligned with clinical knowledge: higher Sphericity (round/oval
shape) and lower Busyness (more homogeneous enhancement) were associated with
TNBC. The framework confirmed known imaging biomarkers and uncovered novel,
interpretable associations. This dual-dictionary approach (BM1.0) enhances AI
model transparency and supports the integration of RFs into routine breast
cancer diagnosis and personalized care.

TL;DR: 提出DLA框架，从单张图像重建可动画3D人类化身，结合多视图生成等技术，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张图像重建可动画3D人类化身的问题，结合生成能力与结构化表示。

Method: 利用视频扩散模型生成多视图，提升为3D高斯，用基于Transformer的编码器投影到与参数化人体模型UV空间对齐的结构化潜在表示，解码为UV空间高斯。

Result: 在ActorsHQ和4D - Dress数据集上，感知质量和光度准确性优于现有方法，可实时渲染和直观编辑。

Conclusion: DLA结合视频扩散模型和姿态感知UV空间高斯映射，弥合非结构化3D表示与高保真、可动画化身之间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce Dream, Lift, Animate (DLA), a novel framework that reconstructs
animatable 3D human avatars from a single image. This is achieved by leveraging
multi-view generation, 3D Gaussian lifting, and pose-aware UV-space mapping of
3D Gaussians. Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a
video diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These
views are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we
propose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships
and projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned
with the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into
UV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and
rendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV
manifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine
visual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without
requiring post-processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
on ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric
accuracy. By combining the generative strengths of video diffusion models with
a pose-aware UV-space Gaussian mapping, DLA bridges the gap between
unstructured 3D representations and high-fidelity, animation-ready avatars.

TL;DR: 本文搭建TinyML + SL测试平台，对比不同无线通信方式下分割学习TinyML性能，测量显示不同通信方式有不同表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微控制器内存和计算预算限制深度学习推理，分割学习虽可解决但在低功耗无线传输协议影响下性能未充分研究。

Method: 搭建基于Espressif ESP32 - S3板的端到端TinyML + SL测试平台，对量化的MobileNetV2模型分区并通过无线更新交付，用不同无线通信方式交换中间激活值。

Result: 以UDP传输时，在特定层分割模型生成5.66 kB张量，3.2 ms遍历链路，稳态往返延迟5.8 s；ESP - NOW往返时间性能最佳为3.7 s；BLE延长电池寿命但延迟超10 s。

Conclusion: 不同无线通信方式在分割学习TinyML中有不同性能表现，可根据需求选择。

Abstract: Running deep learning inference directly on ultra-low-power edge/IoT nodes
has been limited by the tight memory and compute budgets of microcontrollers.
Split learning (SL) addresses this limitation in which it executes part of the
inference process on the sensor and off-loads the remainder to a companion
device. In the context of constrained devices and the related impact of
low-power, over-the-air transport protocols, the performance of split learning
remains largely unexplored. TO the best of our knowledge, this paper presents
the first end-to-end TinyML + SL testbed built on Espressif ESP32-S3 boards,
designed to benchmark the over-the-air performance of split learning TinyML in
edge/IoT environments. We benchmark the performance of a MobileNetV2 image
recognition model, which is quantized to 8-bit integers, partitioned, and
delivered to the nodes via over-the-air updates. The intermediate activations
are exchanged through different wireless communication methods: ESP-NOW, BLE,
and traditional UDP/IP and TCP/IP, enabling a head-to-head comparison on
identical hardware. Measurements show that splitting the model after
block_16_project_BN layer generates a 5.66 kB tensor that traverses the link in
3.2 ms, when UDP is used, achieving a steady-state round-trip latency of 5.8 s.
ESP-NOW presents the most favorable RTT performance 3.7 s; BLE extends battery
life further but increases latency beyond 10s.

Method: 进行广泛分析揭示数据准备问题，设计Pcap - Encoder模型从协议头提取特征。

Result: 现有模型表现受数据准备问题影响，实际场景表现差；Pcap - Encoder模型可提供有效表征，但复杂度影响实际应用。

Conclusion: 现有数据集准备和模型训练有缺陷，需更好测试设计、正确评估方法和严格基准测试。

Abstract: Recently we have witnessed the explosion of proposals that, inspired by
Language Models like BERT, exploit Representation Learning models to create
traffic representations. All of them promise astonishing performance in
encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a
networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through
extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily
influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy
shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during
fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts
are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also
introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we
specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder
appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for
traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in
practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model
training, calling for a better and more conscious test design. We propose a
correct evaluation methodology and stress the need for rigorous benchmarking.

TL;DR: 提出 LAN2CB 框架利用大语言模型简化多机器人协调流程，将自然语言任务描述转为可执行代码，实验显示其有效灵活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多机器人协调依赖专家手动转换，劳动密集、非专家难以参与且应对任务变化不灵活。

Method: 提出 LAN2CB 框架，包含任务分解和代码生成两部分，还引入自然语言任务规范数据集。

Result: 在模拟和现实场景实验表明，LAN2CB 能实现有效灵活的多机器人协调。

Conclusion: LAN2CB 显著减少手动工程需求，支持跨任务类型的泛化。

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination has traditionally relied on a task-specific and
expert-driven pipeline, where natural language mission descriptions are
manually translated by domain experts into mathematical formulation, algorithm
design, and executable code. This conventional process is labor-intensive,
inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements.
Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework
that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the
multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB directly converts natural language
mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems
through two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation,
which parses the mission into a task graph with dependencies, and (2) Code
Generation, which uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to
generate deployable robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of
natural language mission specifications to support development and
benchmarking. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings
show that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination from
natural language, significantly reducing the need for manual engineering while
supporting generalization across mission types. Website:

Motivation: 大语言模型赋能社交机器人发展，处理敏感信息存在隐私风险，需评估其隐私管理能力。

Result: 人与大语言模型的一致性较低。

Conclusion: 讨论了AI隐私意识在人机交互中的影响和潜力。

Abstract: Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following
human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal
cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have
previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user
interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new
opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot
interaction. To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to
collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a
result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within
home environments. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks,
evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we
aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the
context of household social robots. In this study, we present a set of
privacy-relevant scenarios crafted through the lens of Contextual Integrity
(CI). We first survey users' privacy preferences regarding in-home social robot
behaviors and then examine how their privacy orientation affects their choices
of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provide the same set of scenarios and
questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and find that the agreement between
humans and LLMs is low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as a
potential privacy controller, we implement four additional prompting strategies
and compare their results. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential
of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.

Result: 在基于状态和基于图像的模拟任务中始终优于强基线，在离线RL设置中也有效。

Conclusion: 提出的ECRL方法利用等变约束，能提升样本效率和空间泛化能力，在多种任务中有效。

Abstract: Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (CRL) provides a promising framework for
extracting useful structured representations from unlabeled interactions. By
pulling together state-action pairs and their corresponding future states,
while pushing apart negative pairs, CRL enables learning nontrivial policies
without manually designed rewards. In this work, we propose Equivariant CRL
(ECRL), which further structures the latent space using equivariant
constraints. By leveraging inherent symmetries in goal-conditioned manipulation
tasks, our method improves both sample efficiency and spatial generalization.
Specifically, we formally define Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs to
characterize rotation-symmetric robotic manipulation tasks, and build on this
by introducing a novel rotation-invariant critic representation paired with a
rotation-equivariant actor for Contrastive RL. Our approach consistently
outperforms strong baselines across a range of simulated tasks in both
state-based and image-based settings. Finally, we extend our method to the
offline RL setting, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and robust relative pose estimation is crucial for enabling
challenging Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions targeting tumbling derelict
satellites such as ESA's ENVISAT. This work presents a complete pipeline
integrating advanced computer vision techniques with adaptive nonlinear
filtering to address this challenge. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
enhanced with image preprocessing, detects structural markers (corners) from
chaser imagery, whose 2D coordinates are converted to 3D measurements using
camera modeling. These measurements are fused within an Unscented Kalman Filter
(UKF) framework, selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relative
dynamics, to estimate the full relative pose. Key contributions include the
integrated system architecture and a dual adaptive strategy within the UKF:
dynamic tuning of the measurement noise covariance compensates for varying CNN
measurement uncertainty, while adaptive tuning of the process noise covariance,
utilizing measurement residual analysis, accounts for unmodeled dynamics or
maneuvers online. This dual adaptation enhances robustness against both
measurement imperfections and dynamic model uncertainties. The performance of
the proposed adaptive integrated system is evaluated through high-fidelity
simulations using a realistic ENVISAT model, comparing estimates against ground
truth under various conditions, including measurement outages. This
comprehensive approach offers an enhanced solution for robust onboard relative
navigation, significantly advancing the capabilities required for safe
proximity operations during ADR missions.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplishing complex objectives through
the collaborative efforts of individual agents. Among the methodologies
employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of
the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex
objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an
effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy
network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework
that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on
the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each
agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically
adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced
evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables
the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in
dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to
reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both
simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness
of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: 人类特征和交互范式影响协作机器人可接受性，强调亲社会设计重要，反思方法能获取细致反馈，支持开发以用户为中心和对社会负责的机器人系统。

Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical
questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting
with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or
advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying
robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since
participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.
In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that
enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support
meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112
participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos
from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The
experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise
on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM
reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more
pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human
condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences
the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,
while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.
Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those
without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and
interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative
robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight
the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,
supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic
systems tailored to diverse populations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable
autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet
data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents
ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a
self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM
autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts
robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this
process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of
learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with
an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection
improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and
observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative
tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight
unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial
success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of ExpTeach.

Method: 引入专为药物晶体结构生成和排序设计的神经网络势Lavo - NN，将其驱动的晶体生成阶段集成到可扩展的基于云的工作流程。

Result: 在49个独特分子的回顾性基准测试中成功生成匹配110个实验多晶型的结构，平均CSP只需约8.4k CPU小时；案例研究解决实验数据歧义，半盲挑战成功识别和排序三种现代药物多晶型。

Conclusion: 该协议显著降低时间和成本，可在药物发现早期常规部署，与实验筛选并行运行，为化学家提供实时见解。

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is a useful tool in pharmaceutical
development for identifying and assessing risks associated with polymorphism,
yet widespread adoption has been hindered by high computational costs and the
need for both manual specification and expert knowledge to achieve useful
results. Here, we introduce a fully automated, high-throughput CSP protocol
designed to overcome these barriers. The protocol's efficiency is driven by
Lavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained
specifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This
NNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based
workflow. We validate this CSP protocol on an extensive retrospective benchmark
of 49 unique molecules, almost all of which are drug-like, successfully
generating structures that match all 110 $Z' = 1$ experimental polymorphs. The
average CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours,
which is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical
utility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that
resolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that
successfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder
X-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time
and cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug
discovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization. Rapid turnaround times
and high throughput also enable CSP that can be run in parallel with
experimental screening, providing chemists with real-time insights to guide
their work in the lab.

Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both
cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However,
the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there
is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research
examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's
configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we
introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the
strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration
as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ,
differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding
configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the
second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for
computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then
allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local
solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions
for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage)
trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in
example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.
