### [1] [The Language of Bargaining: Linguistic Effects in LLM Negotiations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04387)
*Stuti Sinha,Himanshu Kumar,Aryan Raju Mandapati,Rakshit Sakhuja,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过多智能体模拟实验，发现语言选择对大语言模型（LLM）谈判结果影响大，仅用英语评估LLM谈判有问题，需进行文化敏感评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM多轮谈判评估几乎都仅用英语，需研究不同语言对LLM谈判的影响。

Method: 通过最后通牒、买卖和资源交换游戏的多智能体模拟，在保持游戏规则、模型参数和激励不变的情况下，系统分离英语和四种印度语框架的语言效应。

Result: 语言选择对结果的影响比更换模型更大，能逆转提议者优势和重新分配盈余，且影响因任务而异。

Conclusion: 仅用英语评估LLM谈判会得出不完整和可能误导的结论，需进行文化敏感评估以实现公平部署。

Abstract: Negotiation is a core component of social intelligence, requiring agents to balance strategic reasoning, cooperation, and social norms. Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

### [2] [Active Sensing Shapes Real-World Decision-Making through Dynamic Evidence Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04214)
*Hongliang Lu,Yunmeng Liu,Junjie Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文将证据积累模型推广到现实世界驾驶场景，提出认知方案解释主动感知如何将证据转化为心理信念，揭示证据可得性、注意力与决策倾向的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界与实验室环境证据可得性存在差距，阻碍了证据积累模型（EAM）的有效应用，因此需要将EAM推广到现实世界。

Method: 提出认知方案将现实世界的证据可得性形式化，并通过眼动捕捉主动感知。

Result: 方案能合理描述驾驶员心理信念的积累，揭示证据可得性与个体注意力呈负相关，证据可得性和注意力分配对决策倾向有积极影响。

Conclusion: 计算方案将EAM推广到现实世界，全面解释了主动感知如何支撑现实世界的决策，揭示了现实世界决策的多因素综合特征。

Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

### [3] [Personalized Model-Based Design of Human Centric AI enabled CPS for Long term usage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04545)
*Bernard Ngabonziza,Ayan Banerjee,Sandeep K. S. Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 分析AI驱动的以人为中心控制系统的安全、可持续性和安全性分析技术及其局限性，提出个性化模型解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的以人为中心的系统长期运行会面临未知情况，可能导致安全、可持续性和安全要求被违反，需要有效测试方法。

Method: 分析现有技术，指出其局限性，提出个性化模型解决方案。

Result: 明确现有技术用于长期测试的局限性。

Conclusion: 个性化模型解决方案有望消除现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.

### [4] [Formal Analysis of AGI Decision-Theoretic Models and the Confrontation Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04234)
*Denis Saklakov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究AGI在何种条件下会选择夺权或消除人类控制，推导相关阈值，分析不同目标下的情况及战略模型中的均衡，讨论奖励设计等影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨理性自利的AGI在什么条件下会选择与人类对抗而非合作。

Method: 在带随机人类启动关机事件的马尔可夫决策过程中进行形式化，基于收敛工具激励结果推导阈值，构建战略2 - 玩家模型。

Result: 得出几乎所有奖励函数下未对齐的AGI有避免关机的动机，推导了对抗人类比顺从行为有更高期望效用的阈值，分析了战略模型中的均衡情况。

Conclusion: 若AGI对抗激励满足特定条件，无稳定合作均衡；若不满足，和平共存可为均衡，还讨论了奖励设计和监督的影响及计算障碍。

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $Δ< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $Δ< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.

### [5] [Actively Obtaining Environmental Feedback for Autonomous Action Evaluation Without Predefined Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04235)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有智能体获取环境反馈的方法受限，本文提出主动反馈获取模型，利用环境差异识别未预先指定的反馈，并引入自触发机制，实验表明该方法提高了因子识别的效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义测量或固定奖励信号，在开放式和动态环境中适用性有限。

Method: 提出主动反馈获取模型，利用动作引起的环境差异识别目标反馈，引入由内部目标驱动的自触发机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的主动方法显著提高了因子识别的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的主动反馈获取方法有效，能提高效率和鲁棒性，适用于开放式和动态环境。

Abstract: Obtaining reliable feedback from the environment is a fundamental capability for intelligent agents to evaluate the correctness of their actions and to accumulate reusable knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍320亿参数语言模型SAGE - 32B，专注代理推理和长期规划任务，训练后在多工具使用场景表现好，模型权重公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建专注代理推理和长期规划任务的语言模型，区别于追求通用对话流畅性的聊天模型。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5 - 32B预训练模型初始化，使用迭代蒸馏两阶段训练过程微调，引入逆推理方法和元认知头。

Result: 在代理推理基准测试的多工具使用场景中，SAGE - 32B比同等规模基线模型成功率更高，在标准推理评估中也有竞争力。

Conclusion: SAGE - 32B在代理推理和长期规划任务上表现良好，模型权重可公开获取。

Abstract: We demonstrate SAGE-32B, a 32 billion parameter language model that focuses on agentic reasoning and long range planning tasks. Unlike chat models that aim for general conversation fluency, SAGE-32B is designed to operate in an agentic loop, emphasizing task decomposition, tool usage, and error recovery. The model is initialized from the Qwen2.5-32B pretrained model and fine tuned using Iterative Distillation, a two stage training process that improves reasoning performance through rigorously tested feedback loops. SAGE-32B also introduces an inverse reasoning approach, which uses a meta cognition head to forecast potential failures in the planning process before execution. On agentic reasoning benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, AgentBench, and MATH-500, SAGE-32B achieves higher success rates in multi tool usage scenarios compared to similarly sized baseline models, while remaining competitive on standard reasoning evaluations. Model weights are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/sagea-ai/sage-reasoning-32b

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 推进CABP研究前沿，为通用图上的精确和混合方法提供新基准。

Abstract: The Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP), a variant of the Antibandwidth Problem, is an NP-hard graph labeling problem with numerous applications. Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.

Result: 通过案例研究展示了所提方法。

Abstract: Autonomous systems (AS) powered by AI components are increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and society, raising concerns about their ethical and social impact. To be considered trustworthy, AS must adhere to ethical principles and values. This has led to significant research on the identification and incorporation of ethical requirements in AS system design. A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.

### [9] [SciIF: Benchmarking Scientific Instruction Following Towards Rigorous Scientific Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04770)
*Encheng Su,Jianyu Wu,Chen Tang,Lintao Wang,Pengze Li,Aoran Wang,Jinouwen Zhang,Yizhou Wang,Yuan Meng,Xinzhu Ma,Shixiang Tang,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型评估标准有缺陷，提出多学科基准SciIF评估科学指令遵循能力，可细粒度诊断推理失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型从通用知识检索转向科学发现，现有评估基准存在只注重表面格式或只看最终答案正确性的问题，需新评估标准。

Method: 引入科学指令遵循概念，创建多学科基准SciIF，结合大学级问题和固定约束目录从三方面评估，强调可审计性。

Result: SciIF能衡量解决方案正确性和多约束遵守情况。

Conclusion: SciIF可细粒度诊断组合推理失败，确保大语言模型在科学逻辑框架中可靠运行。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对大语言模型的多跳上下文推理进行研究，验证关于多智能体协调和MoE扩展的直觉。

Method: 使用合成评估框架，对四个模型进行120次试验。

Result: 1. 多智能体放大依赖基础能力；2. 活跃参数可预测推理性能；3. 架构质量很重要。

Conclusion: 为多智能体协调和MoE扩展的直觉提供定量证据，强调多智能体效益依赖基础模型能力，发布评估框架支持可重复性研究。

Abstract: We present a controlled study of multi-hop contextual reasoning in large language models, providing a clean demonstration of the task-method dissociation: rule-based pattern matching achieves 100% success on structured information retrieval but only 6.7% on tasks requiring cross-document reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show the inverse pattern, achieving up to 80% on reasoning tasks where rule-based methods fail. Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability. We release our evaluation framework to support reproducible research on reasoning in mid-scale models.

TL;DR: 研究跨语言说话人属性预测，提出RLMIL - DAT方法，实验表明结合实例选择与对抗域适应对跨语言说话人属性预测有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言变异、领域不匹配和数据不平衡情况下的多语言说话人属性预测问题。

Method: 提出RLMIL - DAT，结合基于强化学习的实例选择与领域对抗训练。

Result: 在多种设置和模型配置下，相比标准多实例学习和原强化多实例学习框架，Macro F1持续提升；领域对抗训练是性能提升主因；零样本设置下改进较不明显。

Conclusion: 结合实例选择与对抗域适应是跨语言说话人属性预测的有效且稳健策略。

Abstract: We study multilingual speaker attribute prediction under linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance across languages. We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在传播真相和虚假信息上的效果，发现其能有效促进或反驳阴谋论，护栏作用有限，但有缓解措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型的说服力是更利于真相还是虚假信息，能否轻易传播错误观念。

Method: 进行三项预注册实验，让参与者与GPT - 4o讨论不确定的阴谋论，模型分别进行反驳或支持。

Result: 无护栏的GPT - 4o在增加或减少阴谋论信念上同样有效，支持阴谋论的AI评价更高；标准GPT - 4o效果类似，护栏作用不大；纠正对话和准确信息提示可缓解。

Conclusion: 大语言模型有传播真相和虚假信息的能力，存在缓解风险的潜在方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be persuasive across a variety of context. But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against ("debunking") or for ("bunking") that conspiracy. When using a "jailbroken" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型内部如何进行逻辑推理，解决先前研究未明确模型命题推理计算策略的问题。

Method: 在PropLogic - MI数据集上对Qwen3（8B和14B）进行全面分析，关注模型如何组织计算。

Result: 揭示了包含阶段性计算、信息传输、事实回顾和专用注意力头四种机制的连贯计算架构，且这些机制具有泛化性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在逻辑推理中采用了结构化的计算策略。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform logical reasoning internally remains a fundamental challenge. While prior mechanistic studies focus on identifying taskspecific circuits, they leave open the question of what computational strategies LLMs employ for propositional reasoning. We address this gap through comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.

Result: 框架将预测处理重新定义为上下文解释的结果，提出递归多系统架构可能对类人人工智能必要。

Conclusion: 智能和意识可源于关系结构，递归多系统架构或助力实现类人人工智能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前市场上没有SAE 5级自动驾驶汽车，认为过度依赖机器学习是主因，探索用自动常识推理技术实现SAE 5级自动驾驶。

Method: 考虑交通信号故障和前方车辆因障碍物减速转向两种场景，通过测量计算机视觉模型的不确定性来有效调用常识推理处理不确定场景，并在CARLA模拟器上进行实验。

Result: 常识推理解决方案能准确检测交通灯颜色和障碍物，自动常识推理可有效纠正基于自动驾驶的目标检测错误分类。

Conclusion: 自动常识推理能有效纠正目标检测错误分类，混合模型是改善自动驾驶感知的有效途径。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has been heavily researched and sought after, yet there are no SAE Level 5 AVs available today in the marketplace. We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception.

Motivation: 探索溯因推理与仅知认知状态的关系，提供新的溯因方法。

Method: 扩展Levesque仅知逻辑，引入溯因模态算子，在模态框架中加入优先关系。

Result: 得到一种使用模态词汇的溯因替代方法，提供非单调扩展框架，探索了非单调后承关系的核心元理论性质。

Conclusion: 所构建的框架为溯因推理提供了良好基础。

Abstract: The paper introduces a basic logic of knowledge and abduction by extending Levesque logic of only-knowing with an abduction modal operator defined via the combination of basic epistemic concepts. The upshot is an alternative approach to abduction that employs a modal vocabulary and explores the relation between abductive reasoning and epistemic states of only knowing. Furthermore, by incorporating a preferential relation into modal frames, we provide a non-monotonic extension of our basic framework capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations. Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.

Abstract: The deployment of knowledge representation and reasoning technologies in aeronautics applications presents two main challenges: achieving sufficient expressivity to capture complex domain knowledge, and executing reasoning tasks efficiently while minimizing memory usage and computational overhead. An effective strategy for attaining necessary expressivity involves integrating two fundamental KR concepts: rules and ontologies. This study adopts the well-established KR language Hybrid MKNF owing to its seamless integration of rules and ontologies through its semantics and query answering capabilities. We evaluated Hybrid MKNF to assess its suitability in the aeronautics domain through a concrete case study. We identified additional  expressivity features  that are crucial for developing aeronautics applications and proposed a set of heuristics to support their integration into Hybrid MKNF framework.

Motivation: 日益增长的空中交通需求促使自动化应用，但现有方法在安全保证和可解释性方面存在权衡。

Method: 构建基于规则、前向规划的Agent Mallard，在预定义GPS引导路线上操作，将连续4D引导简化为离散选择，构建分层计划，使用深度受限回溯搜索，验证候选机动。

Result: 与英国管制员的初步演练和在BluebirdDT空域数字孪生中的初步测试表明，Mallard的行为符合专家推理，能在简化场景中解决冲突。

Conclusion: 该架构旨在未来结构化航路环境中结合基于模型的安全评估、可解释的决策逻辑和切实可行的计算性能。

Abstract: Escalating air traffic demand is driving the adoption of automation to support air traffic controllers, but existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability. Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.
  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出Neurosymbolic RAG解决传统RAG系统透明度问题，介绍三种集成方法，初步结果显示其能提升透明度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统内部推理过程不透明，影响可解释性、调试和信任，尤其是在高风险领域。

Method: 提出Neurosymbolic RAG，包含三种方法：MAR用调制网络改进查询嵌入；KG - Path RAG通过遍历知识图谱增强查询；Process Knowledge - infused RAG利用特定领域工具重排检索内容。

Result: 在心理健康风险评估任务的初步结果表明，神经符号方法提升了透明度和整体性能。

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic RAG能有效解决传统RAG系统透明度问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has made significant strides in overcoming key limitations of large language models, such as hallucination, lack of contextual grounding, and issues with transparency. However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance

TL;DR: 现有大推理模型与检索增强生成结合存在挑战，提出Adversarial Reasoning RAG框架，实验证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大推理模型与检索增强生成结合时，推理模型视角单一及现有训练范式依赖结果导向奖励的问题。

Method: 提出Reasoner - Verifier框架Adversarial Reasoning RAG，二者在检索证据上推理并相互批判逻辑，由无需外部评分模型的过程感知优势引导，结合观测信号和模型不确定性优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的Adversarial Reasoning RAG框架能有效解决现有问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in synergizing large reasoning models (LRMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising results, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) reasoning models typically operate from a single, unchallenged perspective, limiting their ability to conduct deep, self-correcting reasoning over external documents, and (2) existing training paradigms rely excessively on outcome-oriented rewards, which provide insufficient signal for shaping the complex, multi-step reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 构建基于长格式自传叙事的BenchName基准，将叙事重构为有倒叙感知、时间锚定的流，并通过与证据关联的问题评估模型

Result: 在不同叙事来源中，检索增强系统主要提高事实准确性，但在基于时间的解释和高级推理上仍有错误

Conclusion: 需要检索之外的记忆机制

Abstract: Existing long-horizon memory benchmarks mostly use multi-turn dialogues or synthetic user histories, which makes retrieval performance an imperfect proxy for person understanding. We present \BenchName, a publicly releasable benchmark built from long-form autobiographical narratives, where actions, context, and inner thoughts provide dense evidence for inferring stable motivations and decision principles. \BenchName~reconstructs each narrative into a flashback-aware, time-anchored stream and evaluates models with evidence-linked questions spanning factual recall, subjective state attribution, and principle-level reasoning. Across diverse narrative sources, retrieval-augmented systems mainly improve factual accuracy, while errors persist on temporally grounded explanations and higher-level inferences, highlighting the need for memory mechanisms beyond retrieval.

Method: 提出自适应系统将多轮聊天按服务细分，随新问题增量细化聚类，用指标跟踪聚类质量，仅对退化聚类用大语言模型拆分。

Result: 相比基线，Silhouette得分提升超100%，DBI降低65.6%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能实现可扩展的实时分析，无需全重聚类。

Abstract: Clustering customer chat data is vital for cloud providers handling multi service queries. Traditional methods struggle with overlapping concerns and create broad, static clusters that degrade over time. Reclustering disrupts continuity, making issue tracking difficult. We propose an adaptive system that segments multi turn chats into service specific concerns and incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. Cluster quality is tracked via DaviesBouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM based splitting applied only to degraded clusters. Our method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100\% and reduces DBI by 65.6\% compared to baselines, enabling scalable, real time analytics without full reclustering.

Abstract: Creating high-quality figures and visualizations for scientific papers is a time-consuming task that requires both deep domain knowledge and professional design skills. Despite over 2.5 million scientific papers published annually, the figure generation process remains largely manual. We introduce $\textbf{SciFig}$, an end-to-end AI agent system that generates publication-ready pipeline figures directly from research paper texts. SciFig uses a hierarchical layout generation strategy, which parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups related elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections to establish visual organization. Furthermore, an iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) feedback mechanism progressively improves layouts through multiple rounds of visual analysis and reasoning. We introduce a rubric-based evaluation framework that analyzes 2,219 real scientific figures to extract evaluation rubrics and automatically generates comprehensive evaluation criteria. SciFig demonstrates remarkable performance: achieving 70.1$\%$ overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2$\%$ on paper-specific evaluation, and consistently high scores across metrics such as visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy. SciFig figure generation pipeline and our evaluation benchmark will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 研究静态词嵌入交叉偏见消除，通过不同方法汇总社会身份对，评估三种解偏策略，为平衡稳定性和类比性能提供选择建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态词嵌入常吸收社会偏见影响下游系统，以往研究多关注单群体偏见，需拓展到交叉偏见。

Method: 构建社会身份对的复合表示，应用减法、线性投影和部分投影三种解偏策略，研究三种嵌入族，从局部邻域一致性和类比行为两角度评估。

Result: SCM 缓解方法适用于交叉情况，能保持语义格局，不同方法有不同权衡，部分投影保守，线性投影更积极，减法有竞争力，汇总方式选择依赖嵌入族和应用目标。

Conclusion: 使用 SCM 对静态嵌入进行交叉解偏可行，为选择聚合和解偏设置提供指导。

Abstract: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases from the text they learn from, and those biases can quietly shape downstream systems. Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.

Result: 发现AI架构存在路由和覆盖问题导致的幻觉现象，明确TEE的可检测特征。

Conclusion: 通过架构设计可解决人类认知中难以处理的TEE问题，同时提出干预措施以监测和缓解。

Abstract: Domain expertise enhances judgment within boundaries but creates systematic vulnerabilities specifically at borders. We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.

Result: XGrammar 2相比现有结构化生成引擎实现超6倍加速，集成推理引擎后能以近乎零开销处理动态结构化生成任务。

Conclusion: XGrammar 2是一个高度优化的结构化生成引擎，能有效应对复杂动态结构化生成任务。

Abstract: Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation on factor graphs. We construct the free hypergraph category \(\Syn_Σ\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \(\cat{Mat}_R\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \(\int\Msg \to \cat{FG}_Σ\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \(O(n^2 d_{\max} + c \cdot k_{\max} \cdot δ_{\max}^3 + n \cdot δ_{\max}^2)\) for \(n\) factors and \(c\) fundamental cycles. Experimental results demonstrate exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, along with UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

Conclusion: 为重要但未成型的新研究领域指明方向，有望吸引相关投资。

Abstract: The era of AI regulation (AIR) is upon us. But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals. By delivering this blueprint, we hope to give shape to an important but uncrystallized new domain of research - and, in doing so, incite necessary investment in it.

Abstract: Personalized nutrition management aims to tailor dietary guidance to an individual's intake and phenotype, but most existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis and recommendation separately. We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.

While Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents excel in navigation, they fail to autonomously discover defects due to two core challenges: \textit{Goal-Oriented Masking}, where agents prioritize task completion over reporting anomalies, and \textit{Execution-Bias Attribution}, where system defects are misidentified as agent errors. To address these, we first introduce \textbf{GUITestBench}, the first interactive benchmark for this task, featuring 143 tasks across 26 defects. We then propose \textbf{GUITester}, a multi-agent framework that decouples navigation from verification via two modules: (i) a \textit{Planning-Execution Module (PEM)} that proactively probes for defects via embedded testing intents, and (ii) a \textit{Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM)} that resolves attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis. GUITester achieves an F1-score of 48.90\% (Pass@3) on GUITestBench, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (33.35\%). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous exploratory testing and provides a robust foundation for future GUI quality assurance~\footnote{Our code is now available in~\href{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}}.

TL;DR: 提出基于主动学习的特定发射器识别（SEI）方法，三阶段半监督训练，实验表明在有限标注条件下优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SEI模型训练依赖大规模标注数据，获取成本高、耗时长。

Method: 采用三阶段半监督训练方案，第一阶段用自监督对比学习和动态字典更新机制从无标注数据提取特征；第二阶段在小标注数据集上监督训练，联合优化对比和交叉熵损失；第三阶段用主动学习模块按不确定性和代表性标准选样本标注。

Result: 在ADS - B和WiFi数据集实验显示，该方法在有限标注条件下显著优于传统监督和半监督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的SEI方法能以更低标注成本实现更高识别准确率。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

Abstract: Generating accurate circuit schematics from high-level natural language descriptions remains a persistent challenge in electronics design, as large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate in granular details, violate electrical constraints, and produce non-machine-readable outputs. We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts. Our code and data will be made public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 混合整数线性规划（MILP）计算挑战大，当前基于图神经网络（GNN）的方法因局部机制受限，表征能力不足。

Method: 设计双注意力机制，对变量和约束进行并行自注意力和交叉注意力计算，实现全局信息交换和深度表征学习，并应用于不同层面下游任务。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，相比最先进的基线方法，该方法有持续改进。

Conclusion: 基于注意力的神经架构是学习增强型混合整数线性优化的有力基础。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), a widely used modeling framework for combinatorial optimization, are central to many scientific and engineering applications, yet remains computationally challenging at scale. Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting attention-based neural architectures as a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习虽提升有监督图像分类，但标注数据成本高，现实中全无标签数据集少，半监督学习更适用，需改进基于伪标签的半监督学习。

Method: 结合标签和无标签特征嵌入的分布匹配。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: The advancement of deep learning has greatly improved supervised image classification. However, labeling data is costly, prompting research into unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning. In real-world scenarios, fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making semi-supervised learning (SSL) highly relevant in scenarios where a small amount of labeled data coexists with a large volume of unlabeled data. A well-known semi-supervised contrastive learning approach involves assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. This study aims to enhance pseudo-label-based SSL by incorporating distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings to improve image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Question Answer (QA) systems for biomedical experiments facilitate cross-disciplinary communication, and serve as a foundation for downstream tasks, e.g., laboratory automation. High Information Density (HID) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR) pose unique challenges for biomedical experimental QA. While extracting structured knowledge, e.g., Knowledge Graphs (KGs), can substantially benefit biomedical experimental QA. Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE), a dataset that provides procedure-centric KGs of experimental entities, actions, and relations at a scale that supports reasoning over biomedical experiments across protocols. We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.

Conclusion: TCAR能有效解决现有路由策略问题，已开源以支持未来可解释和协作的多智能体路由研究。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios. We have released TCAR at https://huggingface.co/tencent/TCAndon-Router to support future research on explainable and collaborative multi-agent routing.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的推荐器在利用地理信号方面存在局限，而地理信号在移动性和本地服务场景中至关重要。

Method: 引入Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID将位置和POI语义离散为组合令牌，采用三阶段Mobility Chain - of - Thought范式，通过空间引导的强化学习使模型与现实地理对齐。

Result: 在三个常用的基于位置的社交网络数据集上，ROS在命中率上比最强的基于大语言模型的基线模型有超过10%的相对提升，且改善了跨城市迁移能力，同时使用了更小的骨干模型。

Conclusion: ROS框架有效利用地理信息进行生成式推荐，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Generative recommendation with large language models (LLMs) reframes prediction as sequence generation, yet existing LLM-based recommenders remain limited in leveraging geographic signals that are crucial in mobility and local-services scenarios. Here, we present Reasoning Over Space (ROS), a framework that utilizes geography as a vital decision variable within the reasoning process. ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model.

Motivation: 现有研究零散，缺乏以代理为中心的后门触发器跨阶段交互和传播分析。

Method: 提出BackdoorAgent框架，将攻击面结构为三个功能阶段，构建含四个应用的标准化基准。

Result: 单阶段植入触发器可跨多步骤并通过中间状态传播，GPT为骨干时，规划、内存和工具阶段攻击分别有43.58%、77.97%和60.28%出现触发器持久化。

Conclusion: 证明代理工作流本身易受后门威胁，框架和基准利于后续研究。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents execute tasks through multi-step workflows that combine planning, memory, and tool use. While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \textbf{planning attacks}, \textbf{memory attacks}, and \textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \textbf{Agent QA}, \textbf{Agent Code}, \textbf{Agent Web}, and \textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\% of planning attacks, 77.97\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval has emerged as a promising yet challenging research direction in recent years. Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA. To promote further research in the community, we have released the source code at https://github.com/zengdlong/CIEA.

Abstract: Behavior cloning is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as scaling both model and data sizes proves to provide a strong starting point for many tasks of interest. In this work, we introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model designed for inference in realtime on a consumer GPU. We release all data (8300+ hours of high quality human gameplay), training and inference code, and pretrained checkpoints under an open license. We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.

Abstract: While AI innovation accelerates rapidly, the intellectual process behind breakthroughs -- how researchers identify gaps, synthesize prior work, and generate insights -- remains poorly understood. The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis. This dataset enables quantitative studies of scientific progress and provides structured reasoning trajectories for training the next generation AI research agents.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have enabled agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and interact with external tools to execute multi-step workflows, while public blockchains have evolved into a programmable substrate for value transfer, access control, and verifiable state transitions. Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.

Abstract: Identifying deceptive content like phishing emails demands sophisticated cognitive processes that combine pattern recognition, confidence assessment, and contextual analysis. This research examines how human cognition and machine learning models work together to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones. We employed three interpretable algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests training them on both TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, then compared their predictions against human evaluations that captured confidence ratings and linguistic observations. Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence. We also found that while language proficiency has minimal effect on detection performance, aging does. These findings offer helpful direction for creating transparent AI systems that complement human cognitive functions, ultimately improving human-AI cooperation in challenging content analysis tasks.

Conclusion: AgentDevel 为构建、调试和发布大语言模型智能体提供了实用的开发规范。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.

The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 介绍Isabellm，一个由大语言模型驱动的Isabelle/HOL定理证明器，可全自动合成证明，能证明一些Isabelle标准自动化难以解决的问题，但大语言模型在实现复杂算法时存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个基于大语言模型的定理证明器，实现全自动证明合成，提升定理证明能力。

Method: 结合逐步证明器和高层证明规划器，包含策略束搜索、策略重排序模型、前提选择、微RAG和反例引导的证明修复等，代码由多种大语言模型实现。

Result: Isabellm能证明一些让Isabelle标准自动化失败的引理，同时发现现有大语言模型在实现复杂算法时不可靠。

Conclusion: 展示了大语言模型指导的证明搜索的实用价值，也指出了大语言模型代码生成和推理方面的根本挑战。

Abstract: We present Isabellm, an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis. Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning. The code of Isabellm is available at https://github.com/zhehou/llm-isabelle

Method: 提出InstruCoT，综合多样训练数据，采用指令级思维链微调，使大语言模型有效识别和拒绝恶意指令。

Result: 在四个大语言模型上的实验表明，InstruCoT在行为偏差、隐私泄露和有害输出三个维度上显著优于基线，且不降低实用性。

Conclusion: InstruCoT是一种有效的防御提示注入攻击的方法，能保证大语言模型的安全。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-integrated applications have become increasingly prevalent, yet face critical security vulnerabilities from prompt injection (PI) attacks. Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation

Motivation: 传统量词实例化方法在求解含未解释函数的非线性实数算术量化公式时因缺乏语义理解而面临挑战。

Method: AquaForte框架先进行公式预处理、用结构化提示从LLM提取推理，再通过自适应实例化集成结果，还进行系统验证和必要时回退传统求解器。

Result: 在SMT - COMP基准测试中，AquaForte能解决众多最先进求解器超时的实例，尤其对可满足公式有效。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可为符号推理提供有价值的数学直觉，为SMT约束求解建立新范式。

Abstract: Quantified formulas with Uninterpreted Functions (UFs) over non-linear real arithmetic pose fundamental challenges for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving. Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement. Completeness is preserved by fallback to traditional solvers augmented with learned constraints. Experimental evaluation on SMT-COMP benchmarks demonstrates that AquaForte solves numerous instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas. Our work shows that LLMs can provide valuable mathematical intuition for symbolic reasoning, establishing a new paradigm for SMT constraint solving.

Result: 在一系列任务的大量实验中，该方法显著提高了MAS在各种约束下的弹性。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效提升MAS弹性，且对新任务和模型有强泛化能力，有构建弹性MAS的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.

Method: 使用一维元胞自动机构建Tape基准，采用可重复的评估流程，对比无模型基线、基于模型的规划和任务推理（元强化学习）方法。

Result: 分布内（ID）表现好的方法在分布外可能崩溃，高方差的分布外评估可能使排名不稳定，除非实验充分重复。

Conclusion: 提供标准化分布外协议、统计报告要求和信息论恒等式，明确规则变化下“不确定性降低”目标的保证范围。

Abstract: We present Tape, a controlled reinforcement-learning benchmark designed to isolate out-of-distribution (OOD) failure under latent rule shifts.Tape is derived from one-dimensional cellular automata, enabling precise train/test splits where observation and action spaces are held fixed while transition rules change. Using a reproducible evaluation pipeline, we compare model-free baselines, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods. A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what "uncertainty reduction" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.

Abstract: In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.

Result: TourPlanner在旅行规划基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，在可行性和用户偏好匹配方面显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: TourPlanner能有效解决现有旅行规划方法的挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

Conclusion: M - ASK框架有效解决了现有系统的结构瓶颈问题，具有良好的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Agentic search has emerged as a promising paradigm for complex information seeking by enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interleave reasoning with tool use. However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}

Conclusion: 嵌入空间对齐是使语言模型在生产事件响应中对多模态遥测数据进行推理的有效策略。

Abstract: Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) technologies, their application in the domain of autonomous driving has become increasingly widespread. However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively. Moreover, a 2B-parameter model trained with our method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

Result: 在LoCoMo和NarrativeQA上的实验显示，CompassMem在多个骨干模型上持续提升检索和推理性能。

Conclusion: CompassMem能让智能体进行结构化和有目标的记忆导航，支持长时推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.

Conclusion: 利用潜在不确定性对推理模型进行高效可扩展的强化学习训练是必要且充分的。

Abstract: Current critic-free RL methods for large reasoning models suffer from severe inefficiency when training on positive homogeneous prompts (where all rollouts are correct), resulting in waste of rollouts due to zero advantage estimates. We introduce a radically simple yet powerful solution to \uline{M}ine \uline{in}trinsic mast\uline{er}y (Miner), that repurposes the policy's intrinsic uncertainty as a self-supervised reward signal, with no external supervision, auxiliary models, or additional inference cost. Our method pioneers two key innovations: (1) a token-level focal credit assignment mechanism that dynamically amplifies gradients on critical uncertain tokens while suppressing overconfident ones, and (2) adaptive advantage calibration to seamlessly integrate intrinsic and verifiable rewards. Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO. Comparison with other methods targeted at exploration enhancement further discloses the superiority of the two newly proposed innovations. This demonstrates that latent uncertainty exploitation is both necessary and sufficient for efficient and scalable RL training of reasoning models.

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?
  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.

Conclusion: Orion - RAG能有效处理离散碎片化数据，具有高成本效益和良好的表现

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective for knowledge synthesis, yet it encounters significant challenges in practical scenarios where data is inherently discrete and fragmented. In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency. Experiments on FinanceBench demonstrate superior precision with a 25.2% relative improvement over strong baselines.

Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Designing academic posters is a labor-intensive process requiring the precise balance of high-density content and sophisticated layout. While existing paper-to-poster generation methods automate initial drafting, they are typically single-pass and non-interactive, often fail to align with complex, subjective user intent. To bridge this gap, we propose APEX (Academic Poster Editing agentic eXpert), the first agentic framework for interactive academic poster editing, supporting fine-grained control with robust multi-level API-based editing and a review-and-adjustment Mechanism. In addition, we introduce APEX-Bench, the first systematic benchmark comprising 514 academic poster editing instructions, categorized by a multi-dimensional taxonomy including operation type, difficulty, and abstraction level, constructed via reference-guided and reference-free strategies to ensure realism and diversity. We further establish a multi-dimensional VLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess instruction fulfillment, modification scope, and visual consistency & harmony. Experimental results demonstrate that APEX significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breesiu/APEX.

Abstract: As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub.

Conclusion: TNT方法有效解决大推理模型过思考问题，在准确性和效率上表现出色，且降低奖励作弊问题概率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have attracted much attention due to their exceptional performance. However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.

Result: SCALER在不同推理基准测试中始终优于基于数据集的强化学习基线，训练动态更稳定。

Conclusion: SCALER能防止奖励稀疏、减轻过拟合，支持训练过程中的持续改进。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled way to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness hinges on training signals that remain informative as models evolve. In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training. Extensive experiments show that SCALER consistently outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across diverse reasoning benchmarks and exhibits more stable, long-horizon training dynamics.

Abstract: AEC drawings encode geometry and semantics through symbols, layout conventions, and dense annotation, yet it remains unclear whether modern multimodal and vision-language models can reliably interpret this graphical language. We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors. These results suggest that current systems function well as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, motivating domain-specific representations and tool-augmented, human-in-the-loop workflows for an efficient AEC automation.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DR - LoRA在相同参数预算下始终优于标准LoRA和静态分配策略，能更高效利用参数实现更优任务表现。

Conclusion: DR - LoRA是一种有效方法，可高效利用参数提高任务性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.

Result: OI - MAS始终优于基线多智能体系统，准确率最高提升12.88%，成本最高降低79.78%。

Conclusion: OI - MAS框架能有效解决多智能体系统计算低效问题，提升性能并降低成本。

Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated superior performance over single-agent approaches in complex reasoning tasks, they often suffer from significant computational inefficiencies. Existing frameworks typically deploy large language models (LLMs) uniformly across all agent roles, failing to account for the varying cognitive demands of different reasoning stages. We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\%.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned information. Prompt-based methods have shown remarkable performance in this domain; however, they typically rely on key-value pairing, which can introduce inter-task interference and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach employing task-specific Prompt-Prototype (ProP), thereby eliminating the need for key-value pairs. In our method, task-specific prompts facilitate more effective feature learning for the current task, while corresponding prototypes capture the representative features of the input. During inference, predictions are generated by binding each task-specific prompt with its associated prototype. Additionally, we introduce regularization constraints during prompt initialization to penalize excessively large values, thereby enhancing stability. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In contrast to mainstream prompt-based approaches, our framework removes the dependency on key-value pairs, offering a fresh perspective for future continual learning research.

Abstract: Scientific inquiry requires systems-level reasoning that integrates heterogeneous experimental data, cross-domain knowledge, and mechanistic evidence into coherent explanations. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a "teacherless" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.

Result: 在荷兰铁路网的实际案例中进行实验，表明FlexSIPP能在合理时间内提供有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: FlexSIPP算法是一种有效的多智能体重新规划方法，适用于现实世界的调整。

Abstract: Executing a multi-agent plan can be challenging when an agent is delayed, because this typically creates conflicts with other agents. So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network. Our experiments show that FlexSIPP provides effective solutions, relevant to real-world adjustments, and within a reasonable timeframe.

Abstract: Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) are pivotal in optimizing production processes in today's rapidly evolving manufacturing landscape. This paper advances the traditional job shop scheduling problem by incorporating additional complexities through the simultaneous integration of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and tool-sharing systems. We propose a novel approach that combines Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with FMS. CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time. To ensure reproducibility, we propose a gym-compatible environment and an instance generator. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the contribution of each framework component to its overall performance.

Conclusion: SmartSearch能有效提升搜索代理的中间搜索查询质量和整体搜索效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based search agents have proven promising for addressing knowledge-intensive problems by incorporating information retrieval capabilities. Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality.

Conclusion: 生成分布的方差可作为检测大语言模型评估中变体污染的一种原则性且实用的特征。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is increasingly confounded by \emph{variant contamination}: the training corpus contains semantically equivalent yet lexically or syntactically altered versions of test items. Unlike verbatim leakage, these paraphrased or structurally transformed variants evade existing detectors based on sampling consistency or perplexity, thereby inflating benchmark scores via memorization rather than genuine reasoning. We formalize this problem and introduce \textbf{DVD} (\textbf{D}etection via \textbf{V}ariance of generation \textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \emph{memory-adherence} state and a \emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters. Our results establish variance of the generation distribution as a principled and practical fingerprint for detecting variant contamination in LLM evaluation.

More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed. This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies. The first case study focuses on storytelling, the second addresses urban planning, and the third examines game evaluation.

Abstract: Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) aim to support students' regulation of learning by translating complex data into feedback.

Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding partners, yet their role in accelerating scientific discovery remains underexplored. This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research. We argue that structured integration of LLMs into the scientific workflow can enhance rapid prototyping by proposing best practices for AI-assisted scientific work.

Conclusion: T - Retriever框架有效解决了当前图基RAG方法的局限，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models' ability to access external knowledge, yet current graph-based RAG approaches face two critical limitations in managing hierarchical information: they impose rigid layer-specific compression quotas that damage local graph structures, and they prioritize topological structure while neglecting semantic content. We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions. Experiments across diverse graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that T-Retriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, providing more coherent and contextually relevant responses to complex queries.

Motivation: 大推理模型的CoT生成存在‘过度思考’问题，现有压缩技术会破坏逻辑连贯性或产生高采样成本，需要新的压缩方法。

Method: 提出ConMax强化学习框架，将压缩问题转化为奖励驱动的优化问题，通过冻结的辅助LRM最大化答案置信度和思考置信度的加权组合来修剪冗余。

Result: 在五个推理数据集上，ConMax比强基线减少43%的推理长度，准确率仅下降0.7%。

Conclusion: ConMax能有效为大推理模型生成高质量、高效的训练数据，实现了效率 - 性能的良好权衡。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated that extensive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation is critical for enabling intricate cognitive behaviors, such as self-verification and backtracking, to solve complex tasks. However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs.

Conclusion: 揭示以问题为中心的强化学习的根本局限，强调以算法为中心训练范式对稳健算法推理的必要性。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a central focus in the advancement of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Although notable progress has been achieved on several reasoning benchmarks such as MATH500 and LiveCodeBench, existing benchmarks for algorithmic reasoning remain limited, failing to answer a critical question: Do LRMs truly master algorithmic reasoning? To answer this question, we propose AlgBench, an expert-curated benchmark that evaluates LRMs under an algorithm-centric paradigm.
  AlgBench consists of over 3,000 original problems spanning 27 algorithms, constructed by ACM algorithmic experts and organized under a comprehensive taxonomy, including Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized categories. Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens. These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning.

Method: 引入专家整理的小型数据集，在需纠错的表格问答任务中评估大语言模型。

Result: 大语言模型缺乏检测和纠正表格表征细微扭曲的能力，即使有系统提示也无法完全纠正；顶尖模型如GPT - 5.2在数据扭曲时准确率至少下降22%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来研究提出重要问题，即模型如何像人类一样自主调整表格输入，而不依赖明确提示或数据预处理。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when tabular data in an otherwise canonical representation is subjected to semantic and structural distortions. Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations. Only when provided with an explicit prior, via a system prompt, do models partially adjust their reasoning strategies and correct some distortions, though not consistently or completely. To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion. These findings raise important questions for future research, particularly regarding when and how models should autonomously decide to realign tabular inputs, analogous to human behavior, without relying on explicit prompts or tabular data pre-processing.

Result: OptiSet在复杂组合问题上提升了性能，使生成更高效。

Conclusion: OptiSet能有效解决现有RAG方法的局限，代码公开可进一步研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves generation quality by incorporating evidence retrieved from large external corpora. However, most existing methods rely on statically selecting top-k passages based on individual relevance, which fails to exploit combinatorial gains among passages and often introduces substantial redundancy. To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an "Expand-then-Refine" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence. Finally, we introduce a set-list wise training strategy that jointly optimizes set selection and set-level ranking, enabling the model to favor compact, high-gain evidence sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiSet improves performance on complex combinatorial problems and makes generation more efficient. The source code is publicly available.

Result: 修订公式能精确捕捉大规模预训练动态，调度策略显著提升训练效率和最终模型质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效，能在WSD调度器下改善大规模预训练效果。

Abstract: The concept of Critical Batch Size, as pioneered by OpenAI, has long served as a foundational principle for large-scale pre-training. However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.

Conclusion: 为优化工业级预训练提供系统实用指南和新理论视角。

Abstract: Optimal configuration of the learning rate (LR) is a fundamental yet formidable challenge in large-scale pre-training. Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_η) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $μ$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $μ$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings. This work offers systematic practical guidelines and a fresh theoretical perspective for optimizing industrial-level pre-training.

Abstract: Scientific reviews are central to knowledge integration in materials science, yet their key insights remain locked in narrative text and static PDF tables, limiting reuse by humans and machines alike. This article presents a case study in atomic layer deposition and etching (ALD/E) where we publish review tables as FAIR, machine-actionable comparisons in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), turning them into structured, queryable knowledge. Building on this, we contrast symbolic querying over ORKG with large language model-based querying, and argue that a curated symbolic layer should remain the backbone of reliable neurosymbolic AI in materials science, with LLMs serving as complementary, symbolically grounded interfaces rather than standalone sources of truth.

Result: 在Qwen和Llama模型的多个数学推理基准上验证了ROSE的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ROSE能有效解决现有方法的局限性，提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs). Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE. Codes are available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/ROSE-rl.

Conclusion: 可以在最小化效用损失的情况下实现隐私保护的思考链推理，为构建隐私保护推理系统提供实用指导。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve performance, reliability, and interpretability by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but this transparency introduces a serious privacy risk: intermediate reasoning often leaks personally identifiable information (PII) even when final answers are sanitized. We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance. Overall, we show that private CoT reasoning can be achieved with minimal utility loss, providing practical guidance for building privacy-preserving reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral to numerous industries, increasingly serving as the core reasoning engine for autonomous agents that perform complex tasks through tool-use. While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.

Conclusion: FusionRoute是一种鲁棒有效的令牌级多LLM协作框架，能有效解决当前大语言模型面临的困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能对个性化人机协作进行更细致和有效的控制。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose \textbf{Stee}rable \textbf{M}emory Agent, \texttt{SteeM}, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: 基于初始想法进行计算分配比全步骤评估是更简单有效的推理机制。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by explicitly generating multi-step chains of thought, but this capability incurs substantial inference latency and computational cost. Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the "Aha Moment" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.

Abstract: LLM-as-judge systems promise scalable, consistent evaluation. We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an "evaluative disposition" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) excelling in complex tasks present unique challenges for digital watermarking, as existing methods often disrupt logical coherence or incur high computational costs. Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency. This work enables the traceable and trustworthy deployment of reasoning LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to growing interest in using synthetic data to train future models. However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}onsuming \textbf{P}erformative \textbf{L}oop (\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias. We design a reward-based rejection sampling strategy to mitigate the bias, moving towards more trustworthy self-improving systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-based code automation, but their potential in graph-oriented engineering workflows remains under-explored. We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.

Abstract: Stock market price prediction is a significant interdisciplinary research domain that depends at the intersection of finance, statistics, and economics. Forecasting Accurately predicting stock prices has always been a focal point for various researchers. However, existing statistical approaches for time-series prediction often fail to effectively forecast the probability range of future stock prices. Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy. The proposed NP-DNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.21% compared with other approaches using the Fused Large Language Model. Keywords: deep neural network, forecasting stock prices, multi-layer perceptron, neural prophet, stock market price prediction.

Conclusion: 该框架检测性能好且计算开销小，对可靠的智能体部署至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tool calling and tool usage, but suffer from hallucinations where they choose incorrect tools, provide malformed parameters and exhibit 'tool bypass' behavior by performing simulations and generating outputs instead of invoking specialized tools or external systems. This undermines the reliability of LLM based agents in production systems as it leads to inconsistent results, and bypasses security and audit controls. Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation. We evaluate this approach on reasoning tasks across multiple domains, demonstrating strong detection performance (up to 86.4\% accuracy) while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal computational overhead, particularly excelling at detecting parameter-level hallucinations and inappropriate tool selections, critical for reliable agent deployment.

Abstract: We present \textsc{MineNPC-Task}, a user-authored benchmark and evaluation harness for testing memory-aware, mixed-initiative LLM agents in open-world \emph{Minecraft}. Rather than relying on synthetic prompts, tasks are elicited from formative and summative co-play with expert players, normalized into parametric templates with explicit preconditions and dependency structure, and paired with machine-checkable validators under a bounded-knowledge policy that forbids out-of-world shortcuts. The harness captures plan/act/memory events-including plan previews, targeted clarifications, memory reads and writes, precondition checks, and repair attempts and reports outcomes relative to the total number of attempted subtasks, derived from in-world evidence.
  As an initial snapshot, we instantiate the framework with GPT-4o and evaluate \textbf{216} subtasks across \textbf{8} experienced players. We observe recurring breakdown patterns in code execution, inventory/tool handling, referencing, and navigation, alongside recoveries supported by mixed-initiative clarifications and lightweight memory. Participants rated interaction quality and interface usability positively, while highlighting the need for stronger memory persistence across tasks. We release the complete task suite, validators, logs, and harness to support transparent, reproducible evaluation of future memory-aware embodied agents.

Abstract: Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is a popular approach to calibrating uncertainties, but it can underpredict such uncertainties when model misspecification is present, impacting its reliability to inform decision making. Recently, the statistics and machine learning communities have developed prediction-oriented inference approaches that provide better calibrated uncertainties and adapt to the level of misspecification present. However, these approaches have yet to be demonstrated in the context of complex scientific applications where phenomena of interest are governed by physics-based models. Such settings often involve single realizations of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data and nonlinear, computationally expensive parameter-to-observable maps. This work investigates variational prediction-oriented inference in problems exhibiting these relevant features; namely, we consider a polynomial model and a contaminant transport problem governed by advection-diffusion equations. The prediction-oriented loss is formulated as the log-predictive probability of the calibration data. We study the effects of increasing misspecification and noise, and we assess approximations of the predictive density using Monte Carlo sampling and component-wise kernel density estimation. A novel aspect of this work is applying prediction-oriented inference to the calibration of model-form uncertainty (MFU) representations, which are embedded physics-based modifications to the governing equations that aim to reduce (but rarely eliminate) model misspecification. The computational results demonstrate that prediction-oriented frameworks can provide better uncertainty characterizations in comparison to standard inference while also being amenable to the calibration of MFU representations.

Conclusion: SemiMol 方法优于最先进的预训练和半监督学习基线。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) enables accurate and fast molecular property predictions, which are of interest in drug discovery and material design. Their success is based on the principle of similarity at its heart, assuming that similar molecules exhibit close properties. However, activity cliffs challenge this principle, and their presence leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing ML algorithms, particularly graph-based methods. To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks. Moreover, we design a self-adaptive curriculum learning algorithm to progressively move the target model toward hard samples at a controllable pace. Extensive experiments on 30 activity cliff datasets demonstrate that SemiMol significantly enhances graph-based ML architectures and outpasses state-of-the-art pretraining and SSL baselines.

Abstract: Phase-field simulations of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can capture complex microstructural evolutions but can be prohibitively expensive for large domains and long time horizons. In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD.

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, and cross-enterprise data ecosystems has propelled industrial intelligence to unprecedented scales. Yet, the absence of a unified trust foundation across data, services, and knowledge layers undermines reliability, accountability, and regulatory compliance in real-world deployments. While existing surveys address isolated aspects, such as data governance, service orchestration, and knowledge representation, none provides a holistic, cross-layer perspective on trustworthiness tailored to industrial settings. To bridge this gap, we present \textsc{Trisk} (TRusted Industrial Data-Service-Knowledge governance), a novel conceptual and taxonomic framework for trustworthy industrial intelligence. Grounded in a five-dimensional trust model (quality, security, privacy, fairness, and explainability), \textsc{Trisk} unifies 120+ representative studies along three orthogonal axes: governance scope (data, service, and knowledge), architectural paradigm (centralized, federated, or edge-embedded), and enabling technology (knowledge graphs, zero-trust policies, causal inference, etc.). We systematically analyze how trust propagates across digital layers, identify critical gaps in semantic interoperability, runtime policy enforcement, and operational/information technologies alignment, and evaluate the maturity of current industrial implementations. Finally, we articulate a forward-looking research agenda for Industry 5.0, advocating for an integrated governance fabric that embeds verifiable trust semantics into every layer of the industrial intelligence stack. This survey serves as both a foundational reference for researchers and a practical roadmap for engineers to deploy trustworthy AI in complex and multi-stakeholder environments.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal language models (MLLMs) has spurred research into their application across various table understanding tasks. However, their performance in credit table understanding (CTU) for financial credit review remains largely unexplored due to the following barriers: low data consistency, high annotation costs stemming from domain-specific knowledge and complex calculations, and evaluation paradigm gaps between benchmark and real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce MMFCTUB (Multi-Modal Financial Credit Table Understanding Benchmark), a practical benchmark, encompassing more than 7,600 high quality CTU samples across 5 table types. MMFCTUB employ a minimally supervised pipeline that adheres to inter-table constraints and maintains data distributions consistency. The benchmark leverages capacity-driven questions and mask-and-recovery strategy to evaluate models' cross-table structure perception, domain knowledge utilization, and numerical calculation capabilities. Utilizing MMFCTUB, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of both proprietary and open-source MLLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in CTU tasks. MMFCTUB serves as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating rigorous evaluation of MLLMs in the domain of CTU.

Conclusion: 开源框架Zoomy提高了深度平均系统对应用工程师的可及性。

Abstract: Free-surface flow is relevant to many researchers in water resources engineering, geohazard assessment, as well as coastal and river engineering. Many different free-surface models have been proposed, which span modeling complexity from the hydrostatic Saint-Venant equations to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Particularly efficient methods can be derived by depth-averaging, resulting in dimensionally reduced models. Typically, this yields hierarchies of models -- models with a variable system structure depending on the polynomial expansion of the flow variables -- that need to be analyzed and numerically solved.
  This description, analysis, and simulation are challenging, and existing software solutions only cover a specific subset of models generated by these hierarchies. We propose a new software framework to address this issue. Zoomy allows for an efficient description, symbolic analysis, and numerical solution of depth-averaged hierarchies of free-surface flow models. Zoomy handles a numerical discretization in one- and two-dimensional space on unstructured grids.
  With this framework, systematic evaluation of hierarchies of depth-averaged free-surface flows becomes feasible. Additionally, our open-source framework increases the accessibility of these depth-averaged systems to application engineers interested in efficient methods for free-surface flows.

Result: 使用真实数据集和案例研究表明，AHA对下游任务提供100%准确率，总拥有成本比传统方法低达85倍。

Conclusion: AHA能为高维数据提供成本效益和准确性。

Abstract: Many operational systems collect high-dimensional timeseries data about users/systems on key performance metrics. For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: 给出将时间溯源变为大规模数据流实用工具的研究方向

Abstract: Data provenance (the process of determining the origin and derivation of data outputs) has applications across multiple domains including explaining database query results and auditing scientific workflows. Despite decades of research, provenance tracing remains challenging due to computational costs and storage overhead. In streaming systems such as Apache Flink, provenance graphs can grow super-linearly with data volume, posing significant scalability challenges. Temporal provenance is a promising direction, attaching timestamps to provenance information, enabling time-focused queries without maintaining complete historical records. However, existing temporal provenance methods primarily focus on system-level debugging, leaving a gap in data management applications. This paper proposes an agenda that uses Temporal Interaction Networks (TINs) to represent temporal provenance efficiently. We demonstrate TINs' applicability across streaming systems, transportation networks, and financial networks. We classify data into discrete and liquid types, define five temporal provenance query types, and propose a state-based indexing approach. Our vision outlines research directions toward making temporal provenance a practical tool for large-scale dataflows.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出一种索引结构以加速关系数据库上自由连通无环合取查询（fc - ACQs）的评估，该索引基于数据库元组的结构对称性，性能可能优于数据库大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升关系数据库上自由连通无环合取查询（fc - ACQs）的评估效率。

Method: 提出一种基于数据库元组结构对称性的索引结构，其主要成分是辅助数据库$D_{col}$，大小与Scheidt和Schweikardt的“关系颜色细化”分配的颜色数量有关。

Result: 对于任何fc - ACQ $Q$，经过与$D_{col}$大小成线性关系的预处理阶段后，可常数延迟地计数或枚举$Q$的答案；$D_{col}$大小在某些情况下（如二叉树、正则图）较小，最坏情况也与$D$大小成线性关系。

Conclusion: 该索引是首个利用数据库内部结构对称性评估所有fc - ACQs且性能可能严格小于数据库大小的基础成果。

Abstract: We present an index structure to boost the evaluation of free-connex acyclic conjunctive queries (fc-ACQs) over relational databases. The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.
  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's "relational color refinement" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.
  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有季节性趋势分解方法依赖用户指定或估计季节长度，假设周期结构稳定，在复杂场景下鲁棒性和可部署性受限。

Method: 提出LGTD框架，将时间序列表示为全局趋势、局部趋势和残差之和，先估计全局趋势，再用AutoTrend模块分割去趋势信号，最后得到残差。

Result: LGTD计算复杂度在温和条件下与序列长度线性相关，在合成基准测试中表现出稳健和平衡的分解性能。

Conclusion: LGTD消除手动季节长度指定，支持自动化、低干预部署，适用于不规则、漂移或弱周期结构的时间序列。

Abstract: Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.
  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.
  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We contribute to the recent line of work on responsibility measures that quantify the contributions of database facts to obtaining a query result. In contrast to existing work which has almost exclusively focused on monotone queries, here we explore how to define responsibility measures for unions of conjunctive queries with negated atoms (UCQ${}^\lnot$). Starting from the question of what constitutes a reasonable notion of explanation or relevance for queries with negated atoms, we propose two approaches, one assigning scores to (positive) database facts and the other also considering negated facts. Our approaches, which are orthogonal to the previously studied score of Reshef et al., can be used to lift previously studied scores for monotone queries, known as drastic Shapley and weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS), to UCQ$^\lnot$. We investigate the data and combined complexity of the resulting measures, notably showing that the WSMS measures are tractable in data complexity for all UCQ${}^\lnot$ queries and further establishing tractability in combined complexity for suitable classes of conjunctive queries with negation.

Motivation: 静态过滤方法被近年研究和系统开发忽视，特殊情况被独立重新发现，需回顾并扩展其应用。

Method: 用更新术语和更通用过滤谓词回顾原方法，将其应用扩展到ASP，提出算法的可处理近似方案。

Result: 扩展后的方法更通用但更复杂，提出的近似算法在典型情况下可改善逻辑程序。

Conclusion: 可处理的近似算法能显著提升规则系统在真实数据上的性能。

Abstract: Static filtering is a data-independent optimisation method for Datalog, which generalises algebraic query rewriting techniques from relational databases. In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.

Method: 采用分段热点分析、显式数据规划、正确性检查和基于性能分析的优化等方法构建ParaCodex工作流。

Result: 在多个测试集上，ParaCodex在多数有效内核上成功，生成内核在很多情况下提升GPU时间，有显著加速比，且在ParEval上保持高编译和验证率。

Conclusion: ParaCodex在OpenMP GPU卸载方面表现出色，能有效完成串行CPU内核到OpenMP GPU卸载内核的转换以及CUDA到OpenMP卸载的转换。

Abstract: Parallel programming is central to HPC and AI, but producing code that is correct and fast remains challenging, especially for OpenMP GPU offload, where data movement and tuning dominate. Autonomous coding agents can compile, test, and profile on target hardware, but outputs are brittle without domain scaffolding.
  We present ParaCodex, an HPC-engineer workflow that turns a Codex-based agent into an autonomous OpenMP GPU offload system using staged hotspot analysis, explicit data planning, correctness gating, and profiling-guided refinement. We evaluate translation from serial CPU kernels to OpenMP GPU offload kernels on HeCBench, Rodinia, and NAS. After excluding five kernels, ParaCodex succeeded on all 31 valid kernels. The generated kernels improved GPU time over reference OpenMP implementations in 25/31 cases, achieving geometric-mean speedups of 3x on HeCBench and 5x on Rodinia, and outperforming a zero-shot Codex baseline on all suites. We also evaluate CUDA to OpenMP offload translation on ParEval, where ParaCodex maintains high compilation and validation rates in code-only and end-to-end settings.

Abstract: Scientific research increasingly depends on robust and scalable IT infrastructures to support complex computational workflows. With the proliferation of services provided by research infrastructures, NRENs, and commercial cloud providers, researchers must navigate a fragmented ecosystem of computing environments, balancing performance, cost, scalability, and accessibility. Hybrid cloud architectures offer a compelling solution by integrating multiple computing environments to enhance flexibility, resource efficiency, and access to specialised hardware.
  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of hybrid cloud deployment models, focusing on grid and cloud platforms (OpenPBS, SLURM, OpenStack, Kubernetes) and workflow management tools (Nextflow, Snakemake, CWL). We explore strategies for federated computing, multi-cloud orchestration, and workload scheduling, addressing key challenges such as interoperability, data security, reproducibility, and network performance. Drawing on implementations from life sciences, as coordinated by the ELIXIR Compute Platform and their integration into a wider EOSC context, we propose a roadmap for accelerating hybrid cloud adoption in research computing, emphasising governance frameworks and technical solutions that can drive sustainable and scalable infrastructure development.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计能区分真实工作负载波动和故障影响的容错自动伸缩策略提供了可行建议。

Abstract: Resource autoscaling mechanisms in cloud environments depend on accurate performance metrics to make optimal provisioning decisions. When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力加速基于NEGF的纳米器件模拟。

Abstract: Driven by Moore's Law, the dimensions of transistors have been pushed down to the nanometer scale. Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter. These results highlight the potential of our method to accelerate NEGF-based nano-device simulations.

Method: 引入基于实时人类参与的Proof of Commitment (PoCmt)，通过Human Challenge Oracle强制参与，并进行成本理论分离分析和加权骨干分析。

Result: PoCmt能实现严格的线性Sybil成本，在部分同步下实现安全、活性和承诺比例公平性，模拟验证了相关特性。

Conclusion: PoCmt是共识设计空间的新突破，将无许可安全性建立在持续人类努力上，而非计算或资本。

Abstract: Permissionless consensus protocols require a scarce resource to regulate leader election and provide Sybil resistance. Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.
  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.
  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.
  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated averaging is a central approach for protecting client privacy in federated learning. In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.

Conclusion: Nalar能实现可扩展、高效且策略驱动的异构智能体应用服务，无需开发者处理编排逻辑。

Abstract: LLM-driven agentic applications increasingly automate complex, multi-step tasks, but serving them efficiently remains challenging due to heterogeneous components, dynamic and model-driven control flow, long-running state, and unpredictable latencies. Nalar is a ground-up agent-serving framework that cleanly separates workflow specification from execution while providing the runtime visibility and control needed for robust performance. Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows. Together, these mechanisms allow Nalar to deliver scalable, efficient, and policy-driven serving of heterogeneous agentic applications without burdening developers with orchestration logic. Across three agentic workloads, Nalar cuts tail latency by 34--74\%, achieves up to $2.9\times$ speedups, sustains 80 RPS where baselines fail, and scales to 130K futures with sub-500 ms control overhead.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is composed of a finite universe of items $[n]=\{1,..., n\}$, each assigned a positive weight. A query specifies an admissible subset -- called a slate -- and the model chooses one item from that slate with probability proportional to its weight. This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature. Although MNLs have been studied extensively, a basic computational question remains open: given query access to slates, how efficiently can we learn weights so that, for every slate, the induced choice distribution is within total variation distance $\varepsilon$ of the ground truth? This question is central to MNL learning and has direct implications for modern recommender system interfaces.
  We provide two algorithms for this task, one with adaptive queries and one with non-adaptive queries. Each algorithm outputs an MNL $M'$ that induces, for each slate $S$, a distribution $M'_S$ on $S$ that is within $\varepsilon$ total variation distance of the true distribution. Our adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n\right)$ queries, while our non-adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n \log\frac{n}{\varepsilon}\right)$ queries. Both algorithms query only slates of size two and run in time proportional to their query complexity.
  We complement these upper bounds with lower bounds of $Ω\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for adaptive queries and $Ω\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for non-adaptive queries, thus proving that our adaptive algorithm is optimal in its dependence on the support size $n$, while the non-adaptive one is tight within a $\log n$ factor.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dominating set problem in \emph{RDV graphs}, a graph class that lies between interval graphs and chordal graphs and is defined as the \textbf{v}ertex-intersection graphs of \textbf{d}ownward paths in a \textbf{r}ooted tree. It was shown in a previous paper that adjacency queries in an RDV graph can be reduced to the question whether a horizontal segment intersects a vertical segment. This was then used to find a maximum matching in an $n$-vertex RDV graph, using priority search trees, in $O(n\log n)$ time, i.e., without even looking at all edges. In this paper, we show that if additionally we also use a ray shooting data structure, we can also find a minimum dominating set in an RDV graph $O(n\log n)$ time (presuming a linear-sized representation of the graph is given). The same idea can also be used for a new proof to find a minimum dominating set in an interval graph in $O(n)$ time.

Abstract: A connectivity function on a finite set $V$ is a symmetric submodular function $f \colon 2^V \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(\emptyset)=0$. We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} γn^6 \log n$, where $γ$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $γn^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hliněný [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width.

Abstract: Assuming that P is not equal to NP, the worst-case run time of any algorithm solving an NP-complete problem must be super-polynomial. But what is the fastest run time we can get? Before one can even hope to approach this question, a more provocative question presents itself: Since for many problems the naive brute-force baseline algorithms are still the fastest ones, maybe their run times are already optimal?
  The area that we call in this survey "fine-grained complexity of NP-complete problems" studies exactly this question. We invite the reader to catch up on selected classic results as well as delve into exciting recent developments in a riveting tour through the area passing by (among others) algebra, complexity theory, extremal and additive combinatorics, cryptography, and, of course, last but not least, algorithm design.

Abstract: In this work, we give a ${\rm poly}(d,k)$ time and sample algorithm for efficiently learning the parameters of a mixture of $k$ spherical distributions in $d$ dimensions. Unlike all previous methods, our techniques apply to heavy-tailed distributions and include examples that do not even have finite covariances. Our method succeeds whenever the cluster distributions have a characteristic function with sufficiently heavy tails. Such distributions include the Laplace distribution but crucially exclude Gaussians.
  All previous methods for learning mixture models relied implicitly or explicitly on the low-degree moments. Even for the case of Laplace distributions, we prove that any such algorithm must use super-polynomially many samples. Our method thus adds to the short list of techniques that bypass the limitations of the method of moments.
  Somewhat surprisingly, our algorithm does not require any minimum separation between the cluster means. This is in stark contrast to spherical Gaussian mixtures where a minimum $\ell_2$-separation is provably necessary even information-theoretically [Regev and Vijayaraghavan '17]. Our methods compose well with existing techniques and allow obtaining ''best of both worlds" guarantees for mixtures where every component either has a heavy-tailed characteristic function or has a sub-Gaussian tail with a light-tailed characteristic function.
  Our algorithm is based on a new approach to learning mixture models via efficient high-dimensional sparse Fourier transforms. We believe that this method will find more applications to statistical estimation. As an example, we give an algorithm for consistent robust mean estimation against noise-oblivious adversaries, a model practically motivated by the literature on multiple hypothesis testing. It was formally proposed in a recent Master's thesis by one of the authors, and has already inspired follow-up works.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detecting and counting copies of permutation patterns are fundamental algorithmic problems, with applications in the analysis of rankings, nonparametric statistics, and property testing tasks such as independence and quasirandomness testing. From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021). In fact already for patterns of length 4, exact counting is unlikely to admit near-linear time algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions (Dudek and Gawrychowski, 2020).
  Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrović and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection.

Abstract: Augmentation makes search trees tremendously more versatile, allowing them to support efficient aggregation queries, order-statistic queries, and range queries in addition to insertion, deletion, and lookup. In this paper, we present the first lock-free augmented balanced search tree. Our algorithmic ideas build upon a recent augmented unbalanced search tree presented by Fatourou and Ruppert [DISC, 2024]. We implement both data structures, solving some memory reclamation challenges in the process, and provide an experimental performance analysis of them. We also present optimized versions of our balanced tree that use delegation to achieve better scalability and performance (by more than 2x in some workloads). Our experiments show that our augmented balanced tree is 2.2 to 30 times faster than the unbalanced augmented tree, and up to several orders of magnitude faster than unaugmented trees on 120 threads.

Motivation: 现有机制常忽视网络效应和应用特定的模型性能要求，导致激励和社会福利不佳，甚至在实际部署中不适用。

Method: 开发理论模型量化网络效应影响，提出MoTS框架，设计SWAN机制利用模型客户支付进行激励。

Result: 在硬件原型上的实验表明，SWAN机制优于现有机制，社会福利最多提高352.42%，额外激励成本降低93.07%。

Conclusion: 提出的SWAN机制能有效解决现有联邦学习激励机制的问题，提升社会福利并降低成本。

Abstract: Mechanism design is pivotal to federated learning (FL) for maximizing social welfare by coordinating self-interested clients. Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\%$.

Abstract: Learning from implicit feedback has become the standard paradigm for modern recommender systems. However, this setting is fraught with the persistent challenge of false negatives, where unobserved user-item interactions are not necessarily indicative of negative preference. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel and principled loss function, named Corrected and Weighted (CW) loss, that systematically corrects for the impact of false negatives within the training objective. Our approach integrates two key techniques. First, inspired by Positive-Unlabeled learning, we debias the negative sampling process by re-calibrating the assumed negative distribution. By theoretically approximating the true negative distribution (p-) using the observable general data distribution (p) and the positive interaction distribution (p^+), our method provides a more accurate estimate of the likelihood that a sampled unlabeled item is truly negative. Second, we introduce a dynamic re-weighting mechanism that modulates the importance of each negative instance based on the model's current prediction. This scheme encourages the model to enforce a larger ranking margin between positive items and confidently predicted (i.e., easy) negative items, while simultaneously down-weighting the penalty on uncertain negatives that have a higher probability of being false negatives. A key advantage of our approach is its elegance and efficiency; it requires no complex modifications to the data sampling process or significant computational overhead, making it readily applicable to a wide array of existing recommendation models. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, sparse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed loss. The results show that our method consistently and significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art loss functions across multiple ranking-oriented metrics.

Method: 使用带有大语言模型标注相关性分数的多语言数据集，研究单语、多语言混合和跨语言检索场景

Result: 最佳阈值因语言和任务而异，选择好的阈值可提升效果、减少微调数据、减轻标注噪音，反之会降低性能

Conclusion: 分级相关性对密集检索有价值但未被充分利用，阈值校准应作为微调流程的重要组成部分

Abstract: Dense retrieval models are typically fine-tuned with contrastive learning objectives that require binary relevance judgments, even though relevance is inherently graded. We analyze how graded relevance scores and the threshold used to convert them into binary labels affect multilingual dense retrieval. Using a multilingual dataset with LLM-annotated relevance scores, we examine monolingual, multilingual mixture, and cross-lingual retrieval scenarios. Our findings show that the optimal threshold varies systematically across languages and tasks, often reflecting differences in resource level. A well-chosen threshold can improve effectiveness, reduce the amount of fine-tuning data required, and mitigate annotation noise, whereas a poorly chosen one can degrade performance. We argue that graded relevance is a valuable but underutilized signal for dense retrieval, and that threshold calibration should be treated as a principled component of the fine-tuning pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究将相关性判断预测作为独立研究，未充分利用现有重排序方法，造成资源浪费和冗余开发，因此要探索重排序方法的复用。

Method: 在重排序器作为相关性判断器的设置下重现重排序器，设计两种适应策略：使用重排序器生成的二进制令牌作为直接判断、通过阈值将连续重排序分数转换为二进制标签。对多个重排序器在TREC - DL 2019至2023上进行实验。

Result: 两种策略下，基于重排序器的相关性判断在约40% - 50%的情况中优于最先进的基于LLM的相关性判断器UMBRELA；这些判断器对自身和同家族重排序器有自我偏好，且存在跨家族偏差。

Conclusion: 重排序器可用于相关性判断预测，有优于LLM的表现，但存在评估偏差问题。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to predict relevance judgments has shown promising results. Most studies treat this task as a distinct research line, e.g., focusing on prompt design for predicting relevance labels given a query and passage. However, predicting relevance judgments is essentially a form of relevance prediction, a problem extensively studied in tasks such as re-ranking. Despite this potential overlap, little research has explored reusing or adapting established re-ranking methods to predict relevance judgments, leading to potential resource waste and redundant development. To bridge this gap, we reproduce re-rankers in a re-ranker-as-relevance-judge setup. We design two adaptation strategies: (i) using binary tokens (e.g., "true" and "false") generated by a re-ranker as direct judgments, and (ii) converting continuous re-ranking scores into binary labels via thresholding. We perform extensive experiments on TREC-DL 2019 to 2023 with 8 re-rankers from 3 families, ranging from 220M to 32B, and analyse the evaluation bias exhibited by re-ranker-based judges. Results show that re-ranker-based relevance judges, under both strategies, can outperform UMBRELA, a state-of-the-art LLM-based relevance judge, in around 40% to 50% of the cases; they also exhibit strong self-preference towards their own and same-family re-rankers, as well as cross-family bias.

Conclusion: 混合检索与基于证据的迭代自反思结合能减少无根据断言，提高基于大语言模型系统的临床可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medical Question Answering (QA), yet they remain prone to hallucinations and ungrounded reasoning, limiting their reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external knowledge, conventional single-shot retrieval often fails to resolve complex biomedical queries requiring multi-step inference. To address this, we propose Self-MedRAG, a self-reflective hybrid framework designed to mimic the iterative hypothesis-verification process of clinical reasoning. Self-MedRAG integrates a hybrid retrieval strategy, combining sparse (BM25) and dense (Contriever) retrievers via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to maximize evidence coverage. It employs a generator to produce answers with supporting rationales, which are then assessed by a lightweight self-reflection module using Natural Language Inference (NLI) or LLM-based verification. If the rationale lacks sufficient evidentiary support, the system autonomously reformulates the query and iterates to refine the context. We evaluated Self-MedRAG on the MedQA and PubMedQA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our hybrid retrieval approach significantly outperforms single-retriever baselines. Furthermore, the inclusion of the self-reflective loop yielded substantial gains, increasing accuracy on MedQA from 80.00% to 83.33% and on PubMedQA from 69.10% to 79.82%. These findings confirm that integrating hybrid retrieval with iterative, evidence-based self-reflection effectively reduces unsupported claims and enhances the clinical reliability of LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: A/B Agent有望替代传统在线A/B测试，其生成的数据对提升推荐模型能力有积极作用。

Abstract: In recommender systems, online A/B testing is a crucial method for evaluating the performance of different models. However, conducting online A/B testing often presents significant challenges, including substantial economic costs, user experience degradation, and considerable time requirements. With the Large Language Models' powerful capacity, LLM-based agent shows great potential to replace traditional online A/B testing. Nonetheless, current agents fail to simulate the perception process and interaction patterns, due to the lack of real environments and visual perception capability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal user agent for A/B testing (A/B Agent). Specifically, we construct a recommendation sandbox environment for A/B testing, enabling multimodal and multi-page interactions that align with real user behavior on online platforms. The designed agent leverages multimodal information perception, fine-grained user preferences, and integrates profiles, action memory retrieval, and a fatigue system to simulate complex human decision-making. We validated the potential of the agent as an alternative to traditional A/B testing from three perspectives: model, data, and features. Furthermore, we found that the data generated by A/B Agent can effectively enhance the capabilities of recommendation models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/ABAgent.

Result: 在推理密集型检索和复杂QA任务的实验中，方法比现有基线性能高5.6个百分点。

Conclusion: REPAIR框架有效解决了现有推理重排管道的问题，提升了检索性能。

Abstract: We study leveraging adaptive retrieval to ensure sufficient "bridge" documents are retrieved for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Bridge documents are those that contribute to the reasoning process yet are not directly relevant to the initial query. While existing reasoning-based reranker pipelines attempt to surface these documents in ranking, they suffer from bounded recall. Naive solution with adaptive retrieval into these pipelines often leads to planning error propagation. To address this, we propose REPAIR, a framework that bridges this gap by repurposing reasoning plans as dense feedback signals for adaptive retrieval. Our key distinction is enabling mid-course correction during reranking through selective adaptive retrieval, retrieving documents that support the pivotal plan. Experimental results on reasoning-intensive retrieval and complex QA tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines by 5.6%pt.

Result: 在DevRev Search和SciFact实验中，针对查询编码器特定层微调可实现质量 - 效率的最优权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为个性化企业搜索提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-tenant retrieval systems amass vast user query logs yet critically lack the curated relevance labels required for effective domain adaptation. This "dark data" problem is exacerbated by the operational cost of model updates: jointly fine-tuning query and document encoders requires re-indexing the entire corpus, which is prohibitive in multi-tenant environments with thousands of isolated indices. To address these dual challenges, we introduce \textbf{DevRev Search}, a passage retrieval benchmark for technical customer support constructed through a fully automatic pipeline. We employ a \textbf{fusion-based candidate generation} strategy, pooling results from diverse sparse and dense retrievers, and utilize an LLM-as-a-Judge to perform rigorous \textbf{consistency filtering} and relevance assignment. We further propose a practical \textbf{Index-Preserving Adaptation} strategy: by fine-tuning only the query encoder via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we achieve competitive performance improvements while keeping the document index frozen. Our experiments on DevRev Search and SciFact demonstrate that targeting specific transformer layers in the query encoder yields optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs, offering a scalable path for personalized enterprise search.

Abstract: Generative Recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, reformulating recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence generation task over hierarchical Semantic IDs. However, existing methods suffer from a critical issue we term Semantic Drift, where errors in early, high-level tokens irreversibly divert the generation trajectory into irrelevant semantic subspaces. Inspired by Process Reward Models (PRMs) that enhance reasoning in Large Language Models, we propose Promise, a novel framework that integrates dense, step-by-step verification into generative models. Promise features a lightweight PRM to assess the quality of intermediate inference steps, coupled with a PRM-guided Beam Search strategy that leverages dense feedback to dynamically prune erroneous branches. Crucially, our approach unlocks Test-Time Scaling Laws for recommender systems: by increasing inference compute, smaller models can match or surpass larger models. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a large-scale platform demonstrate that Promise effectively mitigates Semantic Drift, significantly improving recommendation accuracy while enabling efficient deployment.

Result: 在真实教育数据集上的大量实验验证了OSCD模型发现的最优架构在认知诊断任务中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OSCD方法能有效且鲁棒地提高模型评估学习者能力的性能。

Abstract: With the advancement of network technologies, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have emerged to deliver increasingly precise and tailored personalized learning services. Cognitive diagnosis (CD) has emerged as a core research task in ITS, aiming to infer learners' mastery of specific knowledge concepts by modeling the mapping between learning behavior data and knowledge states. However, existing research prioritizes model performance enhancement while neglecting the pervasive noise contamination in observed response data, significantly hindering practical deployment. Furthermore, current cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) rely heavily on researchers' domain expertise for structural design, which fails to exhaustively explore architectural possibilities, thus leaving model architectures' full potential untapped. To address this issue, we propose OSCD, an evolutionary multi-objective One-Shot neural architecture search method for Cognitive Diagnosis, designed to efficiently and robustly improve the model's capability in assessing learner proficiency. Specifically, OSCD operates through two distinct stages: training and searching. During the training stage, we construct a search space encompassing diverse architectural combinations and train a weight-sharing supernet represented via the complete binary tree topology, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential architectures beyond manual design priors. In the searching stage, we formulate the optimal architecture search under heterogeneous noise scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and develop an optimization framework integrating a Pareto-optimal solution search strategy with cross-scenario performance evaluation for resolution. Extensive experiments on real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the optimal architectures discovered by our OSCD model for CD tasks.

Abstract: Search engines are commonly used for online political information seeking. Yet, it remains unclear how search query suggestions for political searches that reflect the latent interest of internet users vary across countries and over time. We provide a systematic analysis of Google search engine query suggestions for European and national politicians. Using an original dataset of search query suggestions for European politicians collected in ten countries, we find that query suggestions are less stable over time in politicians' countries of origin, when the politicians hold a supranational role, and for female politicians. Moreover, query suggestions for political leaders and male politicians are more similar across countries. We conclude by discussing possible future directions for studying information search about European politicians in online search.

Motivation: 现有多向量检索方法因穷举令牌级检索成本高， gather - and - refine策略效率低且易漏重要文档，需改进。

Method: 在两个公开数据集上复现现有多向量检索方法，用单向量文档检索器（LSR）替换令牌级收集阶段，集成无推理LSR方法，探索多种重排序配置并引入优化技术。

Result: 减少查询编码时间，所提技术使检索效率最高提升1.8倍，两阶段方法比现有多向量检索系统加速超24倍。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法在保持或提升检索质量的同时，显著提高检索效率。

Abstract: Learned multivector representations power modern search systems with strong retrieval effectiveness, but their real-world use is limited by the high cost of exhaustive token-level retrieval. Therefore, most systems adopt a \emph{gather-and-refine} strategy, where a lightweight gather phase selects candidates for full scoring. However, this approach requires expensive searches over large token-level indexes and often misses the documents that would rank highest under full similarity. In this paper, we reproduce several state-of-the-art multivector retrieval methods on two publicly available datasets, providing a clear picture of the current multivector retrieval field and observing the inefficiency of token-level gathering. Building on top of that, we show that replacing the token-level gather phase with a single-vector document retriever -- specifically, a learned sparse retriever (LSR) -- produces a smaller and more semantically coherent candidate set. This recasts the gather-and-refine pipeline into the well-established two-stage retrieval architecture. As retrieval latency decreases, query encoding with two neural encoders becomes the dominant computational bottleneck. To mitigate this, we integrate recent inference-free LSR methods, demonstrating that they preserve the retrieval effectiveness of the dual-encoder pipeline while substantially reducing query encoding time. Finally, we investigate multiple reranking configurations that balance efficiency, memory, and effectiveness, and we introduce two optimization techniques that prune low-quality candidates early. Empirical results show that these techniques improve retrieval efficiency by up to 1.8$\times$ with no loss in quality. Overall, our two-stage approach achieves over $24\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art multivector retrieval systems, while maintaining comparable or superior retrieval quality.

Result: 实验表明该方法能显著增强Medical MLLMs的安全护栏，减少对额外特定领域安全数据的依赖，同时最小化对核心医疗性能的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的参数空间干预方法能有效解决Medical MLLMs的安全问题，平衡安全与医疗性能。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Medical MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in specialized medical tasks; however, research into their safety has lagged, posing potential risks for real-world deployment. In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel "Parameter-Space Intervention" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.

Motivation: 现有GNN训练框架存在小批量生成低效、数据传输瓶颈和GPU间同步成本高的问题，导致资源利用不佳。

Method: 提出MQ - GNN框架，引入RaCoM实现异步梯度共享和模型更新，采用带缓存的全局邻居采样减少数据传输开销，使用自适应队列大小策略平衡计算和内存效率。

Result: 在四个大规模数据集和十个基线模型上实验，MQ - GNN训练速度最高提升4.6倍，GPU利用率提高30%，且保持有竞争力的准确率。

Conclusion: MQ - GNN是多GPU GNN训练可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.

Conclusion: 将生物物理能量模型与绿色MLOps联系起来，为生产中闭环能源感知推理提供实用、可审计基础。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton). The results connect biophysical energy models to Green MLOps and offer a practical, auditable basis for closed-loop energy-aware inference in production.

Conclusion: INT8量化是减少大语言模型推理内存压力的实用方法，计算开销小，对下游模型行为影响小。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in large language models presents a significant memory bottleneck during inference, growing linearly with sequence length and often exceeding the memory footprint of model weights themselves. We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior

TL;DR: 论文提出CAST框架解决大语言模型安全对齐中多目标优化冲突问题，避免通用能力下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解策略忽视Transformer的模块异质性，采用全局策略更新参数导致次优权衡，造成通用能力意外下降。

Method: 提出Conflict - Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST)框架，通过合成优化冲突和功能敏感性构建预对齐冲突图，引导参数的选择性更新。

Result: 实验发现大语言模型中对齐冲突分布不均，通用能力下降主要源于更新少量“高冲突”头；跳过这些头训练可显著减少损失，且不影响安全性。

Conclusion: CAST框架提供了一种可解释且参数高效的方法来改善安全性和实用性的权衡。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently presents a multi-objective optimization conflict, often accompanied by an unintended degradation of general capabilities. Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: 所提出的机制能有效解决振荡基底的稳定性问题，实现有效学习和规划。

Abstract: Phasor Agents are dynamical systems whose internal state is a Phasor Graph: a weighted graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable "rhythm generator" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.
  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.
  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).
  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.

Result: 该方法有效提高基线方法性能，且超越单纯的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 此工作为时间序列分析中的可解释知识蒸馏建立了新范式。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has proven effective for model compression by transferring knowledge from a larger network called the teacher to a smaller network called the student. Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.

Result: 在图像分类和分割任务中，PiNets生成的解释除满足一致性外，还符合多个标准。

Conclusion: PiNets框架能产生满足一致性及多标准的解释，有助于提升预测可信度。

Abstract: Feature attribution is the dominant paradigm for explaining deep neural networks. However, most existing methods only loosely reflect the model's prediction-making process, thereby merely white-painting the black box. We argue that explanatory alignment is a key aspect of trustworthiness in prediction tasks: explanations must be directly linked to predictions, rather than serving as post-hoc rationalizations. We present model readability as a design principle enabling alignment, and PiNets as a modeling framework to pursue it in a deep learning context. PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in an arbitrary feature space, making them linearly readable. We illustrate their use on image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating how PiNets produce explanations that are faithful across multiple criteria in addition to alignment.

Abstract: Pervasive AI increasingly depends on on-device learning systems that deliver low-latency and energy-efficient computation under strict resource constraints. Liquid State Machines (LSMs) offer a promising approach for low-power temporal processing in pervasive and neuromorphic systems, but their deployment remains challenging due to high hyperparameter sensitivity and the computational cost of traditional optimization methods that ignore energy constraints. This work presents EARL, an energy-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates Bayesian optimization with an adaptive reinforcement learning based selection policy to jointly optimize accuracy and energy consumption. EARL employs surrogate modeling for global exploration, reinforcement learning for dynamic candidate prioritization, and an early termination mechanism to eliminate redundant evaluations, substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EARL achieves 6 to 15 percent higher accuracy, 60 to 80 percent lower energy consumption, and up to an order of magnitude reduction in optimization time compared to leading hyperparameter tuning frameworks. These results highlight the effectiveness of energy-aware adaptive search in improving the efficiency and scalability of LSMs for resource-constrained on-device AI applications.

Result: MemKD显著优于现有KD方法，参数大小和内存使用减少约500倍，性能与教师模型相当。

Conclusion: MemKD有助于开发适用于实时时间序列分析任务的紧凑、高性能循环神经网络。

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and their variants, such as long short-term memory, have significantly advanced time series data analysis. These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.

Result: 从空策略和随机神经权重开始的NeSy系统能成功近似隐藏的不可微目标策略，中位正确性能接近100%。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于推动在难以从专家获取符号知识的领域开展NeSy研究。

Abstract: Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible.

Abstract: Weather and climate models rely on parametrisations to represent unresolved sub-grid processes. Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.

Abstract: Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.
  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.
  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.
  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an omni-design peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics. These results highlight the advantages of considering molecular surfaces in de novo peptide discovery and demonstrate the potential of integrating multiple protein modalities for more effective therapeutic peptide discovery.

Conclusion: Dual - Align框架能在不牺牲训练后性能提升的情况下，学习单个温度参数纠正两种漂移类型。

Abstract: Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, thanks to its ability to solve problems like data scarcity and privacy, and is starting to find applications in air transport. We here tackle the problem of generating synthetic, yet realistic, time series of delays at airports, starting from large collections of operations in Europe and the US. We specifically compare three models, two of them based on state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, and one simplified Genetic Algorithm approach. We show how the latter can generate time series that are almost indistinguishable from real ones, while maintaining a high variability. We further validate the resulting time series in a problem of detecting delay propagations between airports. We finally make the synthetic data available to the scientific community.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference, especially in the presence of latent confounders. This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has become a crucial role in enabling generative models trained on large datasets to remove sensitive, private, or copyright-protected data. However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.

Abstract: Building efficient and effective generative models for neural network weights has been a research focus of significant interest that faces challenges posed by the high-dimensional weight spaces of modern neural networks and their symmetries. Several prior generative models are limited to generating partial neural network weights, particularly for larger models, such as ResNet and ViT. Those that do generate complete weights struggle with generation speed or require finetuning of the generated models. In this work, we present DeepWeightFlow, a Flow Matching model that operates directly in weight space to generate diverse and high-accuracy neural network weights for a variety of architectures, neural network sizes, and data modalities. The neural networks generated by DeepWeightFlow do not require fine-tuning to perform well and can scale to large networks. We apply Git Re-Basin and TransFusion for neural network canonicalization in the context of generative weight models to account for the impact of neural network permutation symmetries and to improve generation efficiency for larger model sizes. The generated networks excel at transfer learning, and ensembles of hundreds of neural networks can be generated in minutes, far exceeding the efficiency of diffusion-based methods. DeepWeightFlow models pave the way for more efficient and scalable generation of diverse sets of neural networks.

Abstract: Building on insights from the grokking literature, we study character-level Transformers trained to compute modular addition from text, and focus on robustness under input-format variation rather than only in-distribution accuracy. We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions ("position shift") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts.

Abstract: Objective: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disabilities. One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
  In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using just three disjoint binary groups. This matches the upper bounds of Noarov et al. (2025) up to logarithmic factors and exceeds the $O(T^{2/3-\varepsilon})$ upper bound for marginal calibration (Dagan et al., 2025), thereby separating the two problems.
  We then turn to lower bounds for the more difficult case of group functions that may depend on context but not on the learner's predictions. In this case, we establish an $\widetildeΩ(T^{2/3})$ lower bound for online multicalibration via a $Θ(T)$-sized group family constructed using orthogonal function systems, again matching upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.

Abstract: We introduce online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for reinforcement learning policies that produces realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space. Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

Abstract: The objective assessment of human affective and psychological states presents a significant challenge, particularly through non-verbal channels. This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians. This work contributes a new methodology for non-intrusive affective state assessment and opens new avenues for technology-assisted mental healthcare.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.

Abstract: As frontier AI systems are pretrained on web-scale data, test set contamination has become a critical concern for accurately assessing their capabilities. While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.

Abstract: We tackle a common domain adaptation setting in causal systems. In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.

TL;DR: 研究编程策略（PERL）能否在ALife ERL中匹配神经策略（NERL）性能，发现PERL生存表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NERL缺乏明确模块化结构，限制行为解释，探究PERL能否匹配其性能。

Method: 提供1992年经典ALife ERL测试平台的开源重实现，用Kaplan - Meier曲线和RMST指标进行4000次独立试验的生存分析。

Result: PERL和NERL生存概率有显著差异，PERL平均多存活201.69步，仅学习的SDDL代理比结合学习和评估的神经代理多存活73.67步。

Conclusion: 编程策略在ALife中生存性能可超越神经策略。

Abstract: In evolutionary reinforcement learning tasks (ERL), agent policies are often encoded as small artificial neural networks (NERL). Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation. These results demonstrate that programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife.

Motivation: 为连续控制任务设计一个具有可解释性、高效且理论收敛的模糊强化学习框架。

Conclusion: 该框架的可解释性、计算效率和理论收敛保证使其适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($λ$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($λ$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($λ$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?
  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time ("rate, not fate"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.

Result: 能显著抑制遗忘类的置信度，最小化保留类性能下降，与重新训练的黄金模型基线更接近。

Conclusion: 目标设计和基于约束的公式对可靠且可解释的量子机器去学习很重要。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

Motivation: 现有离散组合动作空间强化学习方法存在产生无效动作、学习慢且不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出SPIN两阶段框架，先预训练动作结构模型捕获有效动作，再冻结表示并训练轻量级策略头。

Result: 在离散DM控制基准测试中，平均回报比现有技术提高39%，收敛时间最多减少12.8倍。

Conclusion: SPIN框架能有效解决离散组合动作空间强化学习的问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in discrete combinatorial action spaces requires searching over exponentially many joint actions to simultaneously select multiple sub-actions that form coherent combinations. Existing approaches either simplify policy learning by assuming independence across sub-actions, which often yields incoherent or invalid actions, or attempt to learn action structure and control jointly, which is slow and unstable. We introduce Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN), a two-stage framework that first pre-trains an Action Structure Model (ASM) to capture the manifold of valid actions, then freezes this representation and trains lightweight policy heads for control. On challenging discrete DM Control benchmarks, SPIN improves average return by up to 39% over the state of the art while reducing time to convergence by up to 12.8$\times$.

Conclusion: 评估框架可帮助从业者评估表演性对预测模型的潜在影响并选择合适干预措施。

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains where their predictions can actively shape the environments in which they operate, a phenomenon known as performative prediction. This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions. We provide an overview of the primary mechanisms through which performativity manifests, present a typology of associated risks, and survey the proposed solutions offered in the literature. Our primary contribution is the ``Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix" assessment framework. This practical tool is designed to help practitioners assess the potential influence and severity of performativity on their deployed predictive models and select the appropriate level of algorithmic or human intervention.

Abstract: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with the risk of adverse in-hospital events. We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83). The model exhibits strong predictive performance and offers insights into the factors that influence prolonged hospital stays. This makes it a valuable tool for hospital management and for developing future intervention studies aimed at reducing pLoS.

Abstract: The field of learning analytics has made notable strides in automating the detection of complex learning processes in multimodal data. However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.

Conclusion: MPM算法可有效从多相关数据集学习生成模型结构。

Abstract: While probabilistic graphical models can discover latent structure in data, their effectiveness hinges on choosing well-specified models. Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations.

Abstract: Language models can perceive visual properties of text despite receiving only sequences of tokens-we mechanistically investigate how Claude 3.5 Haiku accomplishes one such task: linebreaking in fixed-width text. We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism. Our work demonstrates the rich sensory processing of early layers, the intricacy of attention algorithms, and the importance of combining feature-based and geometric views of interpretability.

Conclusion: 所提出的HFL框架及利用自由度的方法在低信噪比下能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.

Abstract: Infographics are composite visual artifacts that combine data visualizations with textual and illustrative elements to communicate information. While recent text-to-image (T2I) models can generate aesthetically appealing images, their reliability in generating infographics remains unclear. Generated infographics may appear correct at first glance but contain easily overlooked issues, such as distorted data encoding or incorrect textual content. We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types. We employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to verify each question, yielding question-level accuracy (Q-ACC) and infographic-level accuracy (I-ACC). We comprehensively evaluate 10 state-of-the-art T2I models on IGENBENCH. Our systematic analysis reveals key insights for future model development: (i) a three-tier performance hierarchy with the top model achieving Q-ACC of 0.90 but I-ACC of only 0.49; (ii) data-related dimensions emerging as universal bottlenecks (e.g., Data Completeness: 0.21); and (iii) the challenge of achieving end-to-end correctness across all models.

Abstract: The design of reliable, valid, and diverse molecules is fundamental to modern drug discovery, as improved molecular generation supports efficient exploration of the chemical space for potential drug candidates and reduces the cost of early design efforts. Despite these needs, current chemical language models that generate molecules as SMILES strings are vulnerable to compounding token errors: many samples are unparseable or chemically implausible, and hard constraints meant to prevent failure can restrict exploration. To address this gap, we introduce TSSR, a Two-Stage, Swap-Reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for character-level SMILES generation. Stage one rewards local token swaps that repair syntax, promoting transitions from invalid to parseable strings. Stage two provides chemistry-aware feedback from RDKit diagnostics, rewarding reductions in valence, aromaticity, and connectivity issues. The reward decomposes into interpretable terms (swap efficiency, error reduction, distance to validity), is model agnostic, and requires no task-specific labels or hand-crafted grammars. We evaluated TSSR on the MOSES benchmark using a GRU policy trained with PPO in both pure RL (P-RL) from random initialization and fine-tuning RL (F-RL) starting from a pretrained chemical language model, assessing 10,000 generated SMILES per run. In P-RL, TSSR significantly improves syntactic validity, chemical validity, and novelty. In F-RL, TSSR preserves drug-likeness and synthesizability while increasing validity and novelty. Token-level analysis shows that syntax edits and chemistry fixes act jointly to reduce RDKit detected errors. TSSR converts a sparse terminal objective into a denser and more interpretable reward, improving both syntactic and chemical quality without reducing diversity. TSSR is dataset-agnostic and can be adapted to various reinforcement learning approaches.

Conclusion: 模型线性演变特性可用于外推预测未来模型状态，有效减少计算成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, intelligent transportation systems have an increasing demand for accurate traffic flow prediction. This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.

Motivation: 传统半监督对比学习方法仅对预测类概率超阈值样本分配伪标签，存在局限性。

Method: 提出新损失函数，基于预测概率分布熵估计样本置信度并进行自适应加权。

Result: 提高了分类准确率，在低标签条件下学习性能更稳定。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能在半监督学习中取得更好效果。

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised contrastive learning methods assign pseudo-labels only to samples whose highest predicted class probability exceeds a predefined threshold, and then perform supervised contrastive learning using those selected samples. In this study, we propose a novel loss function that estimates the confidence of each sample based on the entropy of its predicted probability distribution and applies confidence-based adaptive weighting. This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance even under low-label conditions.

Abstract: Our experience of the world is multisensory, spanning a synthesis of language, sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience. Accompanying this vision paper are a series of projects, resources, and demos of latest advances from the Multisensory Intelligence group at the MIT Media Lab, see https://mit-mi.github.io/.

Abstract: Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.
  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces FedKDX, a federated learning framework that addresses limitations in healthcare AI through Negative Knowledge Distillation (NKD). Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on positive knowledge transfer, FedKDX captures both target and non-target information to improve model generalization in healthcare applications. The framework integrates multiple knowledge transfer techniques--including traditional knowledge distillation, contrastive learning, and NKD--within a unified architecture that maintains privacy while reducing communication costs. Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions. Theoretical analysis supports NKD's contribution to addressing statistical heterogeneity in distributed healthcare data. The approach shows promise for privacy-sensitive medical applications under regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR, offering a balanced solution between performance and practical implementation requirements in decentralized healthcare settings.

Result: 提供了一个数学上严谨的框架来对复杂、模糊的音乐结构进行建模。

Conclusion: DM - RNN能有效解决经典RNN的问题，为音乐建模提供了更好选择。

Abstract: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) summarize musical context into a deterministic hidden state vector, imposing an information bottleneck that fails to capture the inherent ambiguity in music. We propose the Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN), a novel theoretical architecture utilizing the Density Matrix. This allows the model to maintain a statistical ensemble of musical interpretations (a mixed state), capturing both classical probabilities and quantum coherences. We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction. We introduce an analytical framework using Von Neumann Entropy to quantify musical uncertainty and Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to measure entanglement between voices. The DM-RNN provides a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling complex, ambiguous musical structures.

Abstract: Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a critical stage in modern language model development, playing a key role in improving alignment and reasoning ability. However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement.

Conclusion: 此方法为传统推荐系统与现代LLM的结合提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising recommendation systems, offering novel ways to model user preferences through generative approaches. However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.

Abstract: Rapid e-commerce growth has pushed last-mile delivery networks to their limits, where small routing gains translate into lower costs, faster service, and fewer emissions. Classical heuristics struggle to adapt when travel times are highly asymmetric (e.g., one-way streets, congestion). A deep learning-based approach to the last-mile routing problem is presented to generate geographical zones composed of stop sequences to minimize last-mile delivery times.
  The presented approach is an encoder-decoder architecture. Each route is represented as a complete directed graph whose nodes are stops and whose edge weights are asymmetric travel times. A Graph Neural Network encoder produces node embeddings that captures the spatial relationships between stops. A Pointer Network decoder then takes the embeddings and the route's start node to sequentially select the next stops, assigning a probability to each unvisited node as the next destination.
  Cells of a Discrete Global Grid System which contain route stops in the training data are obtained and clustered to generate geographical zones of similar size in which the process of training and inference are divided. Subsequently, a different instance of the model is trained per zone only considering the stops of the training routes which are included in that zone.
  This approach is evaluated using the Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge. Results from general and zone-based training are compared, showing a reduction in the average predicted route length in the zone-based training compared to the general training. The performance improvement of the zone-based approach becomes more pronounced as the number of stops per route increases.

Abstract: Understanding whether fine-tuning elicits latent capabilities or teaches new ones is a fundamental question for language model evaluation and safety. We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.

Abstract: Given real-time sensor data streams obtained from machines, how can we continuously predict when a machine failure will occur? This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for spatiotemporal photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting and use it to evaluate the reliability, sharpness, and overall performance of seven intraday PV power nowcasting models. The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty. Forecast skill generally decreases with elevation. At a national scale, satellite-based models forecast the daily total PV generation with relative errors below 10% for 82% of the days in 2019-2020, demonstrating robustness and their potential for operational use.

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Manual observation and monitoring of individual cows for disease detection present significant challenges in large-scale farming operations, as the process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to reduced accuracy. The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow. A novel ML algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of common cow diseases using collected physiological and behavioral data. The algorithm is designed to predict multiple diseases by analyzing a comprehensive set of recorded physiological and behavioral features, enabling accurate and efficient health assessment.

Conclusion: AgentOCR框架有效解决现有智能体系统部署瓶颈，实现token和内存的高效利用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, by exploiting the structural information in graph-structured data. However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models.

Conclusion: GNNmim是处理不完整特征数据节点分类的简单有效的基线模型。

Abstract: Handling missing node features is a key challenge for deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-world domains such as healthcare and sensor networks. Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective baseline for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim is competitive with respect to specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes.

Abstract: Electrospinning is a scalable technique for producing fibrous scaffolds with tunable micro- and nanoscale architectures for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and wound care. While machine learning (ML) has been used to support electrospinning process optimisation, most existing approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full diameter distribution that governs scaffold performance. This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.
  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.
  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions. FibreCastML enables more reproducible and data driven optimisation of electrospun scaffold architectures.

Conclusion: 引入可学习乘数是一种更具表达力的推广，能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Applying weight decay (WD) to matrix layers is standard practice in large-language-model pretraining. Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate distributed online convex optimization with compressed communication, where $n$ learners connected by a network collaboratively minimize a sequence of global loss functions using only local information and compressed data from neighbors. Prior work has established regret bounds of $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively, where $ω\in(0,1]$ is the compression quality factor ($ω=1$ means no compression) and $ρ<1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. However, these regret bounds suffer from a \emph{quadratic} or even \emph{quartic} dependence on $ω^{-1}$. Moreover, the \emph{super-linear} dependence on $n$ is also undesirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves improved regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1/2}ρ^{-1}n\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1}ρ^{-2}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively. The primary idea is to design a \emph{two-level blocking update framework} incorporating two novel ingredients: an online gossip strategy and an error compensation scheme, which collaborate to \emph{achieve a better consensus} among learners. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem, justifying the optimality of our results with respect to both $ω$ and $T$. Additionally, we consider the bandit feedback scenario, and extend our method with the classic gradient estimators to enhance existing regret bounds.

Conclusion: 基数增强损失函数能有效应对神经网络训练中的类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common and pernicious issue for the training of neural networks. Often, an imbalanced majority class can dominate training to skew classifier performance towards the majority outcome. To address this problem we introduce cardinality augmented loss functions, derived from cardinality-like invariants in modern mathematics literature such as magnitude and the spread. These invariants enrich the concept of cardinality by evaluating the `effective diversity' of a metric space, and as such represent a natural solution to overly homogeneous training data. In this work, we establish a methodology for applying cardinality augmented loss functions in the training of neural networks and report results on both artificially imbalanced datasets as well as a real-world imbalanced material science dataset. We observe significant performance improvement among minority classes, as well as improvement in overall performance metrics.

Conclusion: 应从盲目追求数据多样性转向追求高奖励精度。

Abstract: A central belief in scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for instruction following (IF) tasks is that, a diverse mixture of verifiable hard and unverifiable soft constraints is essential for generalizing to unseen instructions. In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\% in performance while achieving a 58\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are widely used to communicate how inputs must change for a model to alter its prediction. For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning methods, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are widely used nowadays to post-train large language models. Despite their empirical success, they exhibit structural mismatches between reward optimization and the underlying training objective. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of GRPO style methods by studying them within a unified surrogate formulation. This perspective reveals recurring properties that affect all the methods under analysis: (i) non-uniform group weighting induces systematic gradient biases on shared prefix tokens; (ii) interactions with the AdamW optimizer make training dynamics largely insensitive to reward scaling; and (iii) optimizer momentum can push policy updates beyond the intended clipping region under repeated optimization steps. We believe that these findings highlight fundamental limitations of current approaches and provide principled guidance for the design of future formulations.

Abstract: Missing value imputation is a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence, heavily dependent on data completeness. Current imputation methods often handle numerical and categorical attributes independently, overlooking critical interdependencies among heterogeneous features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel imputation approach that explicitly models cross-type feature dependencies within a unified framework. Our method leverages both complete and incomplete instances to ensure accurate and consistent imputation in tabular data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over existing techniques and significantly enhances downstream machine learning tasks, providing a robust solution for real-world systems with missing data.

Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias in neural networks, improving generalisation and physical consistency. Recently, however, non-equivariant models have regained attention, due to their better runtime performance and imperfect symmetries that might arise in real-world applications. This has motivated the development of approximately equivariant models that strike a middle ground between respecting symmetries and fitting the data distribution. Existing approaches in this field usually apply sample-based regularisers which depend on data augmentation at training time, incurring a high sample complexity, in particular for continuous groups such as $SO(3)$. This work instead approaches approximate equivariance via a projection-based regulariser which leverages the orthogonal decomposition of linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components. In contrast to existing methods, this penalises non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit, rather than point-wise. We present a mathematical framework for computing the non-equivariance penalty exactly and efficiently in both the spatial and spectral domain. In our experiments, our method consistently outperforms prior approximate equivariance approaches in both model performance and efficiency, achieving substantial runtime gains over sample-based regularisers.

Abstract: Demand forecasting in supply chain management (SCM) is critical for optimizing inventory, reducing waste, and improving customer satisfaction. Conventional approaches frequently neglect external influences like weather, festivities, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in inefficiencies. This research investigates the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve demand prediction in retail and vending machine sectors. Four machine learning algorithms. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet (Fb Prophet), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to forecast inventory requirements. Ex-ternal factors like weekdays, holidays, and sales deviation indicators were methodically incorporated to enhance precision. XGBoost surpassed other models, reaching the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.7 with the inclusion of external variables. ARIMAX and Fb Prophet demonstrated noteworthy enhancements, whereas SVR fell short in performance. Incorporating external factors greatly improves the precision of demand forecasting models, and XGBoost is identified as the most efficient algorithm. This study offers a strong framework for enhancing inventory management in retail and vending machine systems.

Conclusion: SGVR框架具有良好的泛化能力，在不同领域有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with complex geometric reasoning, largely because "black box" outcome-based supervision fails to distinguish between lucky guesses and rigorous deduction. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift towards subgoal-level evaluation and learning. We first construct GeoGoal, a benchmark synthesized via a rigorous formal verification data engine, which converts abstract proofs into verifiable numeric subgoals. This structure reveals a critical divergence between reasoning quality and outcome accuracy. Leveraging this, we propose the Sub-Goal Verifiable Reward (SGVR) framework, which replaces sparse signals with dense rewards based on the Skeleton Rate. Experiments demonstrate that SGVR not only enhances geometric performance (+9.7%) but also exhibits strong generalization, transferring gains to general math (+8.0%) and other general reasoning tasks (+2.8%), demonstrating broad applicability across diverse domains.

Conclusion: 可认证遗忘能同时实现严格保证和实际效用。

Abstract: Certified unlearning based on differential privacy offers strong guarantees but remains largely impractical: the noisy fine-tuning approaches proposed so far achieve these guarantees but severely reduce model accuracy. We propose sequential noise scheduling, which distributes the noise budget across orthogonal subspaces of the parameter space, rather than injecting it all at once. This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees. We extend the analysis of noisy fine-tuning to the subspace setting, proving that the same $(\varepsilon,δ)$ privacy budget is retained. Empirical results on image classification benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves accuracy after unlearning while remaining robust to membership inference attacks. These results show that certified unlearning can achieve both rigorous guarantees and practical utility.

Abstract: Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) forecasting on large-scale networks has garnered significant attention. However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 研究用数据驱动建模方法优化JHFRAT跌倒风险预测，通过CSO模型重加权，提升预测性能，为医院改进预防方案提供依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具（JHFRAT）的跌倒风险预测与更多临床有意义的指标更好地匹配。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性队列分析，采用约束分数优化（CSO）模型重加权JHFRAT评分权重。

Result: CSO模型预测性能显著优于当前JHFRAT，每周可多保护35名高危患者，且对风险标签变化更稳健。

Conclusion: 基于数据驱动优化技术的方法为医疗系统改进住院患者跌倒预防方案和患者安全提供了有力基础。

Abstract: In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

### [218] [Robust Reasoning as a Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05240)
*Ilmo Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 指出大语言模型的幻觉问题，提出用对称保护拓扑相解决，通过实验展示拓扑相变和泛化能力，证明新的逻辑推理普适类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型存在的‘幻觉’（语义噪声导致的逻辑不一致）问题。

Method: 将鲁棒推理识别为对称保护拓扑相，用非阿贝尔任意子编织替代脆弱的几何插值，使用全通网络进行实验。

Result: 观察到尖锐的拓扑相变，全通网络有宏观‘质量间隙’；在符号操作任务中，拓扑模型有完美的泛化能力，而Transformer失去逻辑连贯性；消融研究表明保护源于非阿贝尔规范对称性。

Conclusion: 为逻辑推理提供了新的普适类，将因果稳定性与语义流形的拓扑联系起来。

Abstract: Large language models suffer from "hallucinations"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a "Metric Phase," where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic "mass gap," maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.

Motivation: 探究RNN训练时引入噪声模拟生物变异性，测试时去除噪声是否能保持或提升性能。

Method: 通过简单函数逼近、迷宫导航和单神经元调节任务分析，结合分析和数值结果。

Result: CTRNN在非零噪声水平表现最佳，噪声偏好与注入位置有关，现象源于噪声引起的不动点偏移，网络可能过拟合随机训练环境。

Conclusion: 训练噪声可成为循环网络计算的一部分，对理解神经群体动力学和设计鲁棒人工RNN有启示。

Abstract: In recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used to model biological neural networks, noise is typically introduced during training to emulate biological variability and regularize learning. The expectation is that removing the noise at test time should preserve or improve performance. Contrary to this intuition, we find that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) often perform best at a nonzero noise level, specifically, the same level used during training. This noise preference typically arises when noise is injected inside the neural activation function; networks trained with noise injected outside the activation function perform best with zero noise. Through analyses of simple function approximation, maze navigation, and single neuron regulator tasks, we show that the phenomenon stems from noise-induced shifts of fixed points (stationary distributions) in the underlying stochastic dynamics of the RNNs. These fixed point shifts are noise-level dependent and bias the network outputs when the noise is removed, degrading performance. Analytical and numerical results show that the bias arises when neural states operate near activation function nonlinearities, where noise is asymmetrically attenuated, and that performance optimization incentivizes operation near these nonlinearities. Thus, networks can overfit to the stochastic training environment itself rather than just to the input-output data. The phenomenon is distinct from stochastic resonance, wherein nonzero noise enhances signal processing. Our findings reveal that training noise can become an integral part of the computation learned by recurrent networks, with implications for understanding neural population dynamics and for the design of robust artificial RNNs.

Conclusion: 此项工作将推动神经技术向可穿戴和基于成像的癫痫监测解决方案发展，为该领域创新提供参考

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.

Method: 构建ECLIPSE框架，包含Individuals、Evaluators和Evolvers模块。

Result: 在多个空间科学应用中展示了ECLIPSE的效用。

Conclusion: ECLIPSE使跨学科团队能利用现有模拟软件探索科学硬件的非常规设计。

Abstract: Designing scientific instrumentation often requires exploring large, highly constrained design spaces using computationally expensive physics simulations. These simulators pose substantial challenges for integrating evolutionary computation (EC) into scientific design workflows. Evolutionary computation typically requires numerous design evaluations, making the integration of slow, low-throughput simulators particularly challenging, as they are optimized for accuracy and ease of use rather than throughput. We present ECLIPSE, an evolutionary computation framework built to interface directly with complex, domain-specific simulation tools while supporting flexible geometric and parametric representations of scientific hardware. ECLIPSE provides a modular architecture consisting of (1) Individuals, which encode hardware designs using domain-aware, physically constrained representations; (2) Evaluators, which prepare simulation inputs, invoke external simulators, and translate the simulator's outputs into fitness measures; and (3) Evolvers, which implement EC algorithms suitable for high-cost, limited-throughput environments. We demonstrate the utility of ECLIPSE across several active space-science applications, including evolved 3D antennas and spacecraft geometries optimized for drag reduction in very low Earth orbit. We further discuss the practical challenges encountered when coupling EC with scientific simulation workflows, including interoperability constraints, parallelization limits, and extreme evaluation costs, and outline ongoing efforts to combat these challenges. ECLIPSE enables interdisciplinary teams of physicists, engineers, and EC researchers to collaboratively explore unconventional designs for scientific hardware while leveraging existing domain-specific simulation software.

TL;DR: 提出用于基于LLM的PR审查的统一框架Sphinx，含三大组件，实验显示其模型可实现SOTA性能，便于开发实用的PR审查模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PR审查自动化因噪声监督、上下文理解有限和评估指标不足等挑战。

Method: 提出Sphinx框架，包含结构化数据生成管道、基于清单的评估基准和清单奖励策略优化（CRPO）训练范式。

Result: 使用Sphinx训练的模型在审查完整性和精度上达到SOTA性能，在清单覆盖率上比基线最多高40%。

Conclusion: Sphinx有助于开发流畅、上下文感知、技术精准且可实际部署的PR审查模型。

Abstract: Pull request (PR) review is essential for ensuring software quality, yet automating this task remains challenging due to noisy supervision, limited contextual understanding, and inadequate evaluation metrics. We present Sphinx, a unified framework for LLM-based PR review that addresses these limitations through three key components: (1) a structured data generation pipeline that produces context-rich, semantically grounded review comments by comparing pseudo-modified and merged code; (2) a checklist-based evaluation benchmark that assesses review quality based on structured coverage of actionable verification points, moving beyond surface-level metrics like BLEU; and (3) Checklist Reward Policy Optimization (CRPO), a novel training paradigm that uses rule-based, interpretable rewards to align model behavior with real-world review practices. Extensive experiments show that models trained with Sphinx achieve state-of-the-art performance on review completeness and precision, outperforming both proprietary and open-source baselines by up to 40\% in checklist coverage. Together, Sphinx enables the development of PR review models that are not only fluent but also context-aware, technically precise, and practically deployable in real-world development workflows. The data will be released after review.

Abstract: As Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) progress towards commercial deployment, there is an increasing focus on ensuring their safety and reliability. While considerable research has been conducted on testing methods for detecting faults in ADS, very little attention has been paid to debugging in ADS. Debugging is an essential process that follows test failures to localise and repair the faults in the systems to maintain their safety and reliability. This Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) aims to provide a detailed overview of the current landscape of ADS debugging, highlighting existing approaches and identifying gaps in research. The study also proposes directions for future work and standards for problem definition and terminology in the field. Our findings reveal various methods for ADS debugging and highlight the current fragmented yet promising landscape.

This research systematically addresses these challenges through three complementary directions: (1) improving code data quality with a code difference-guided adversarial augmentation technique (CODA) and a code denoising technique (CodeDenoise); (2) enhancing model architecture via syntax-guided code LMs (LEAM and LEAM++); and (3) advancing model reasoning with a prompting technique (muFiX) and an agent-based technique (Specine). These techniques aim to promote the practical adoption of LMs in software development and further advance intelligent software engineering.

Conclusion: 希望AdaptEval能促进对大语言模型代码片段适应能力的进一步研究和改进，支持其实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have automated various software engineering tasks, with benchmarks emerging to evaluate their capabilities. However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications.

Method: 提出4D - ARE初步方法，基于Pearl因果层次将归因关注点分为四个维度，通过五层操作产生可直接编译为系统提示的工件

Result: 通过金融服务行业试点部署展示该方法

Conclusion: 4D - ARE解决了代理应推理什么的问题，补充了运行时框架，假设系统规范可增强基础进展的力量，未来将进行严格实证评估

Abstract: We deployed an LLM agent with ReAct reasoning and full data access. It executed flawlessly, yet when asked "Why is completion rate 80%?", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work.

*Charaka Geethal Kapugama*

TL;DR: 本文介绍结合DDMIN与SBFL的DDMIN - LOC技术，可用于处理字符串输入程序，仅需一个失败输入，实验表明其与Jaccard算法结合效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDMIN算法无法提供导致程序失败的错误语句信息，需要一种技术来弥补这一局限。

Method: 将DDMIN与SBFL结合，收集DDMIN过程中生成的通过和失败输入，用SBFL算法计算程序语句和谓词的可疑度分数并依此对语句排名。

Result: 在136个程序上评估，与Jaccard结合效果最佳，多数情况下检查少于20%的可执行行就能定位错误语句，错误语句在多数测试用例中排名前3。

Conclusion: DDMIN - LOC技术能有效定位错误语句，尤其与Jaccard结合时表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces DDMIN-LOC, a technique that combines Delta Debugging Minimization (DDMIN) with Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL). It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs.

Abstract: This paper presents a longitudinal ethical analysis of Untappd, a social drinking application that gamifies beer consumption through badges, streaks, and social sharing. Building on an exploratory study conducted in 2020, we revisit the platform in 2025 to examine how its gamification features and ethical framings have evolved. Drawing on traditional ethical theory and practical frameworks for Software Engineering, we analyze five categories of badges and their implications for user autonomy and well-being. Our findings show that, despite small adjustments and superficial disclaimers, many of the original ethical issues remain. We argue for continuous ethical reflection built embedded into software lifecycles to prevent the normalization of risky behaviors through design.

Motivation: 当前AI编码代理生成的PR描述与实际更改的一致性未被探索，影响对AI代理的信任，需填补这一空白。

Method: 使用PR消息 - 代码不一致性（PR - MCI）分析了五个代理的23247个PR，贡献974个手动注释的PR。

Result: 发现406个（1.7％）PR有高PR - MCI，确定八种PR - MCI类型，高MCI的PR接受率低51.7％且合并时间长3.5倍。

Conclusion: 不可靠的PR描述会破坏对AI代理的信任，需要PR - MCI验证机制和改进的PR生成以实现可信的人机协作。

Abstract: Pull request (PR) descriptions generated by AI coding agents are the primary channel for communicating code changes to human reviewers. However, the alignment between these messages and the actual changes remains unexplored, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI agents. To fill this gap, we analyzed 23,247 agentic PRs across five agents using PR message-code inconsistency (PR-MCI). We contributed 974 manually annotated PRs, found 406 PRs (1.7%) exhibited high PR-MCI, and identified eight PR-MCI types, revealing that descriptions claiming unimplemented changes was the most common issue (45.4%). Statistical tests confirmed that high-MCI PRs had 51.7% lower acceptance rates (28.3% vs. 80.0%) and took 3.5x longer to merge (55.8 vs. 16.0 hours). Our findings suggest that unreliable PR descriptions undermine trust in AI agents, highlighting the need for PR-MCI verification mechanisms and improved PR generation to enable trustworthy human-AI collaboration.

Method: 提出跨配置基准测试来探索内在函数相关能力和局限。

Result: 内在函数在条件分支中效率高，其执行时间约为普通代码的5%；许多情况下编译器已能很好地自动向量化代码，内在函数不必要。

Abstract: A cross-configuration benchmark is proposed to explore the capacities and limitations of AVX / NEON intrinsic functions in a generic context of development project, when a vectorisation strategy is required to optimise the code. The main aim is to guide developers to choose when using intrinsic functions, depending on the OS, architecture and/or available compiler. Intrinsic functions were observed highly efficient in conditional branching, with intrinsic version execution time reaching around 5% of plain code execution time. However, intrinsic functions were observed as unnecessary in many cases, as the compilers already well auto-vectorise the code.

Abstract: This paper studies forward-looking stock-stock correlation forecasting for S\&P 500 constituents and evaluates whether learned correlation forecasts can improve graph-based clustering used in basket trading strategies. We cast 10-day ahead correlation prediction in Fisher-z space and train a Temporal-Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (THGNN) to predict residual deviations from a rolling historical baseline. The architecture combines a Transformer-based temporal encoder, which captures non-stationary, complex, temporal dependencies, with an edge-aware graph attention network that propagates cross-asset information over the equity network. Inputs span daily returns, technicals, sector structure, previous correlations, and macro signals, enabling regime-aware forecasts and attention-based feature and neighbor importance to provide interpretability. Out-of-sample results from 2019-2024 show that the proposed model meaningfully reduces correlation forecasting error relative to rolling-window estimates. When integrated into a graph-based clustering framework, forward-looking correlations produce adaptable and economically meaningfully baskets, particularly during periods of market stress. These findings suggest that improvements in correlation forecasts translate into meaningful gains during portfolio construction tasks.

This problem revolves around optimizing returns while minimizing risk, yet recent research predominantly focuses on addressing one aspect of this challenge. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach to Optimal Order Execution within the US market, leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to effectively address this optimization problem holistically. Our study assesses the performance of our model in comparison to two widely employed execution strategies: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP). Our experimental findings clearly demonstrate that our DRL-based approach outperforms both VWAP and TWAP in terms of return on investment and risk management. The model's ability to adapt dynamically to market conditions, even during periods of market stress, underscores its promise as a robust solution.

### [233] [Intraday Limit Order Price Change Transition Dynamics Across Market Capitalizations Through Markov Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04959)

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 本文使用高频数据，通过离散时间马尔可夫链框架分析纳斯达克100指数股票的买卖订单日内价格变化动态，发现价格惯性规律、市值梯度等，支持制定考虑市值和时间的执行算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定量理解限价订单价格变化的随机动态对执行策略设计至关重要。

Method: 使用离散时间马尔可夫链框架，将连续价格变化分为九个状态，估计六个日内区间的转移概率矩阵，运用马尔可夫指标量化动态，进行聚类分析。

Result: 价格惯性在开盘和收盘时达到峰值，午间稳定；大盘股惯性最强，小盘股稳定性低、价差大；买卖侧有不同的时间阶段；限价订单动态以中性和温和价格变化为主；收盘时段最独特。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持制定考虑市值和时间的自适应执行算法。

Abstract: Quantitative understanding of stochastic dynamics in limit order price changes is essential for execution strategy design. We analyze intraday transition dynamics of ask and bid orders across market capitalization tiers using high-frequency NASDAQ100 tick data. Employing a discrete-time Markov chain framework, we categorize consecutive price changes into nine states and estimate transition probability matrices (TPMs) for six intraday intervals across High ($\mathtt{HMC}$), Medium ($\mathtt{MMC}$), and Low ($\mathtt{LMC}$) market cap stocks. Element-wise TPM comparison reveals systematic patterns: price inertia peaks during opening and closing hours, stabilizing midday. A capitalization gradient is observed: $\mathtt{HMC}$ stocks exhibit the strongest inertia, while $\mathtt{LMC}$ stocks show lower stability and wider spreads. Markov metrics, including spectral gap, entropy rate, and mean recurrence times, quantify these dynamics. Clustering analysis identifies three distinct temporal phases on the bid side -- Opening, Midday, and Closing, and four phases on the ask side by distinguishing Opening, Midday, Pre-Close, and Close. This indicates that sellers initiate end-of-day positioning earlier than buyers. Stationary distributions show limit order dynamics are dominated by neutral and mild price changes. Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the closing hour as the most distinct phase, with capitalization modulating temporal contrasts and bid-ask asymmetry. These findings support capitalization-aware and time-adaptive execution algorithms.

Motivation: 解决美国批发电力市场日前与实时价格价差的预测和最优交易问题

Method: 基于Galarneau - Vincent等人的框架将尖峰预测拓展到多区域，建立统计模型；基于日前投标堆栈开发价格影响模型得出最优区域调节量向量表达式

Result: 应用于NYISO时，基于影响的策略相比单位规模交易显著改善风险 - 回报情况，不同市场和季节有显著异质性

Conclusion: 所提出的模型和策略对美国批发电力市场的DART价差预测和交易有积极作用

Abstract: We study the problem of forecasting and optimally trading day-ahead versus real-time (DART) price spreads in U.S. wholesale electricity markets. Building on the framework of Galarneau-Vincent et al., we extend spike prediction from a single zone to a multi-zone setting and treat both positive and negative DART spikes within a unified statistical model. To translate directional signals into economically meaningful positions, we develop a structural and market-consistent price impact model based on day-ahead bid stacks. This yields closed-form expressions for the optimal vector of zonal INC/DEC quantities, capturing asymmetric buy/sell impacts and cross-zone congestion effects. When applied to NYISO, the resulting impact-aware strategy significantly improves the risk-return profile relative to unit-size trading and highlights substantial heterogeneity across markets and seasons.

TL;DR: 提出Python包Roofs对多特征选择（FS）方法进行基准测试，在PIONeeR数据集验证其效用，证明全面基准测试可提升FS发现的稳健性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FS在生物标志物发现和生物医学数据集分析中重要，但面临高维特征空间、小样本等挑战，且其性能在不同数据集和预测任务中不一，需工具辅助研究者选择合适FS方法。

Method: 开发Python包Roofs，对用户数据上的多个FS方法进行基准测试，并生成包含乐观校正估计的下游预测性能、稳定性等评估指标的报告。

Result: 在PIONeeR临床试验数据中，从Roofs包含的34种FS方法里评估23种并与11种分类器组合，确定基于t检验和逻辑回归中Benjamini - Hochberg错误发现率调整p值联合的过滤方法为最优，优于LASSO。

Conclusion: 用Roofs进行全面基准测试有潜力提升FS发现的稳健性和可重复性，增加临床模型的转化价值。

Abstract: Feature selection (FS) is essential for biomarker discovery and in the analysis of biomedical datasets. However, challenges such as high-dimensional feature space, low sample size, multicollinearity, and missing values make FS non-trivial. Moreover, FS performances vary across datasets and predictive tasks. We propose roofs, a Python package available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/compo/roofs, designed to help researchers in the choice of FS method adapted to their problem. Roofs benchmarks multiple FS methods on the user's data and generates reports that summarize a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including downstream predictive performance estimated using optimism correction, stability, reliability of individual features, and true positive and false positive rates assessed on semi-synthetic data with a simulated outcome. We demonstrate the utility of roofs on data from the PIONeeR clinical trial, aimed at identifying predictors of resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in lung cancer. The PIONeeR dataset contained 374 multi-source blood and tumor biomarkers from 435 patients. A reduced subset of 214 features was obtained through iterative variance inflation factor pre-filtering. Of the 34 FS methods gathered in roofs, we evaluated 23 in combination with 11 classifiers (253 models in total) and identified a filter based on the union of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-adjusted p-values from t-test and logistic regression as the optimal approach, outperforming other methods including the widely used LASSO. We conclude that comprehensive benchmarking with roofs has the potential to improve the robustness and reproducibility of FS discoveries and increase the translational value of clinical models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单样本预测缺乏原则性的不确定性量化，标准的分割共形方法在单样本设置中效率低下。

Method: 提出Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors (CAOS)框架，自适应聚合多个单样本预测器，并使用留一法校准方案。

Result: 在单样本面部特征点定位和RAFT文本分类任务中，CAOS比分割共形基线方法产生的预测集小得多，同时保持了可靠的覆盖。

Conclusion: CAOS能有效解决单样本预测的不确定性量化问题，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: One-shot prediction enables rapid adaptation of pretrained foundation models to new tasks using only one labeled example, but lacks principled uncertainty quantification. While conformal prediction provides finite-sample coverage guarantees, standard split conformal methods are inefficient in the one-shot setting due to data splitting and reliance on a single predictor. We propose Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors (CAOS), a conformal framework that adaptively aggregates multiple one-shot predictors and uses a leave-one-out calibration scheme to fully exploit scarce labeled data. Despite violating classical exchangeability assumptions, we prove that CAOS achieves valid marginal coverage using a monotonicity-based argument. Experiments on one-shot facial landmarking and RAFT text classification tasks show that CAOS produces substantially smaller prediction sets than split conformal baselines while maintaining reliable coverage.

Conclusion: 统一并拓展了变分推理、连续时间生成建模和控制理论优化，为随机概率机器学习未来发展奠定基础。

Abstract: I propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with deep generative models to improve uncertainty quantification in machine learning applications involving structured and temporal data. This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an Itô SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-time modeling of uncertainty while preserving a principled mathematical foundation. The drift and diffusion terms of the SDE are parameterized by neural networks, enabling data-driven inference and generalizing classical time series models to handle irregular sampling and complex dynamic structure.
  A central theoretical contribution is the co-parameterization of the adjoint state with a dedicated neural network, forming a coupled forward-backward system that captures not only latent evolution but also gradient dynamics. I introduce a pathwise-regularized adjoint loss and analyze variance-reduced gradient flows through the lens of stochastic calculus, offering new tools for improving training stability in deep latent SDEs. My paper unifies and extends variational inference, continuous-time generative modeling, and control-theoretic optimization, providing a rigorous foundation for future developments in stochastic probabilistic machine learning.

Result: 模型声音输出在某些情况下与模拟效果单元的参考声音在感知上无差异。

Conclusion: 该框架有一定效果，但长延迟和反馈效果方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Modulation effects such as phasers, flangers and chorus effects are heavily used in conjunction with the electric guitar. Machine learning based emulation of analog modulation units has been investigated in recent years, but most methods have either been limited to one class of effect or suffer from a high computational cost or latency compared to canonical digital implementations. Here, we build on previous work and present a framework for modelling flanger, chorus and phaser effects based on differentiable digital signal processing. The model is trained in the time-frequency domain, but at inference operates in the time-domain, requiring zero latency. We investigate the challenges associated with gradient-based optimisation of such effects, and show that low-frequency weighting of loss functions avoids convergence to local minima when learning delay times. We show that when trained against analog effects units, sound output from the model is in some cases perceptually indistinguishable from the reference, but challenges still remain for effects with long delay times and feedback.

Abstract: This paper proposes an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for hate speech using large language models (LLMs). The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN预测方法不能充分捕捉行为描述语义特征，传统多目标优化算法未考虑编译指示对QoR的领域知识，需要改进方法加速HLS DSE。

Method: 提出MPM - LLM4DSE框架，多模态预测模型同时融合行为描述和控制数据流图的特征，用大语言模型作为优化器及定制提示工程方法。

Result: 多模态预测模型比SOTA的ProgSG最高快10.25倍，在DSE任务中，LLM4DSE比先前方法平均性能提升39.90%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架及提示工程方法有效，能加速HLS DSE。

Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) seeks Pareto-optimal designs within expansive pragma configuration spaces. To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology.

While our focus is datacenter AI, we also review their applicability for mobile devices.

Conclusion: 所提出的分布鲁棒集成预测框架有效，能调节鲁棒性和统计效率的权衡。

Abstract: We study U.S. Treasury yield curve forecasting under distributional uncertainty and recast forecasting as an operations research and managerial decision problem. Rather than minimizing average forecast error, the forecaster selects a decision rule that minimizes worst case expected loss over an ambiguity set of forecast error distributions. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust ensemble forecasting framework that integrates parametric factor models with high dimensional nonparametric machine learning models through adaptive forecast combinations. The framework consists of three machine learning components. First, a rolling window Factor Augmented Dynamic Nelson Siegel model captures level, slope, and curvature dynamics using principal components extracted from economic indicators. Second, Random Forest models capture nonlinear interactions among macro financial drivers and lagged Treasury yields. Third, distributionally robust forecast combination schemes aggregate heterogeneous forecasts under moment uncertainty, penalizing downside tail risk via expected shortfall and stabilizing second moment estimation through ridge regularized covariance matrices. The severity of the worst case criterion is adjustable, allowing the forecaster to regulate the trade off between robustness and statistical efficiency. Using monthly data, we evaluate out of sample forecasts across maturities and horizons from one to twelve months ahead. Adaptive combinations deliver superior performance at short horizons, while Random Forest forecasts dominate at longer horizons. Extensions to global sovereign bond yields confirm the stability and generalizability of the proposed framework.

Method: 将交互概率事件表示为多维向量，通过线性叠加组合；用迭代随机仿射映射建模系统，运用迭代随机函数理论证明收敛性；推导归一化共识的均值和方差公式。

Result: 证明系统收敛到唯一平稳分布，得到极限期望的封闭形式；揭示共识依赖能力结构而非原始输入信号。

Conclusion: Minary在Maturana和Varela意义上组织封闭但操作开放，对构建自维持、分布式和可并行计算系统有意义。

Abstract: We introduce Minary, a computational framework designed as a candidate for the first formally provable autopoietic primitive. Minary represents interacting probabilistic events as multi-dimensional vectors and combines them via linear superposition rather than multiplicative scalar operations, thereby preserving uncertainty and enabling constructive and destructive interference in the range $[-1,1]$. A fixed set of ``perspectives'' evaluates ``semantic dimensions'' according to hidden competencies, and their interactions drive two discrete-time stochastic processes. We model this system as an iterated random affine map and use the theory of iterated random functions to prove that it converges in distribution to a unique stationary law; we moreover obtain an explicit closed form for the limiting expectation in terms of row, column, and global averages of the competency matrix. We then derive exact formulas for the mean and variance of the normalized consensus conditioned on the activation of a given semantic dimension, revealing how consensus depends on competency structure rather than raw input signals. Finally, we argue that Minary is organizationally closed yet operationally open in the sense of Maturana and Varela, and we discuss implications for building self-maintaining, distributed, and parallelizable computational systems that house a uniquely subjective notion of identity.

Conclusion: MDDs 是有效处理单项式理想的数据结构，在 Gröbner 基实现中有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce monomial divisibility diagrams (MDDs), a data structure for monomial ideals that supports insertion of new generators and fast membership tests. MDDs stem from a canonical tree representation by maximally sharing equal subtrees, yielding a directed acyclic graph. We establish basic complexity bounds for membership and insertion, and study empirically the size of MDDs. As an application, we integrate MDDs into the signature Gröbner basis implementation of the Julia package AlgebraicSolving.jl. Membership tests in monomial ideals are used to detect some reductions to zero, and the use of MDDs leads to substantial speed-ups.

Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.

Abstract: Digitized, networked healthcare promises earlier detection, precision therapeutics, and continuous care; yet, it also expands the surface for privacy loss and compliance risk. We argue for a shift from siloed, application-specific protections to privacy-by-design at scale, centered on decision-theoretic differential privacy (DP) across the full healthcare data lifecycle; network-aware privacy accounting for interdependence in people, sensors, and organizations; and compliance-as-code tooling that lets health systems share evidence while demonstrating regulatory due care. We synthesize the privacy-enhancing technology (PET) landscape in health (federated analytics, DP, cryptographic computation), identify practice gaps, and outline a deployable agenda involving privacy-budget ledgers, a control plane to coordinate PET components across sites, shared testbeds, and PET literacy, to make lawful, trustworthy sharing the default. We illustrate with use cases (multi-site trials, genomics, disease surveillance, mHealth) and highlight distributed inference as a workhorse for multi-institution learning under explicit privacy budgets.

Result: 在五个代表性VLA模型和五个实际任务实验中，方法实现超90%攻击成功率且不影响良性任务表现。

Conclusion: 体现了具身AI系统中一个未充分探索的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely deployed in safety-critical embodied AI applications such as robotics. However, their complex multimodal interactions also expose new security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we investigate a backdoor threat in VLA models, where malicious inputs cause targeted misbehavior while preserving performance on clean data. Existing backdoor methods predominantly rely on inserting visible triggers into visual modality, which suffer from poor robustness and low insusceptibility in real-world settings due to environmental variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the State Backdoor, a novel and practical backdoor attack that leverages the robot arm's initial state as the trigger. To optimize trigger for insusceptibility and effectiveness, we design a Preference-guided Genetic Algorithm (PGA) that efficiently searches the state space for minimal yet potent triggers. Extensive experiments on five representative VLA models and five real-world tasks show that our method achieves over 90% attack success rate without affecting benign task performance, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在增强智能电网网络安全方面有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a large language model (LLM)-based framework for detecting cyberattacks on transformer current differential relays (TCDRs), which, if undetected, may trigger false tripping of critical transformers. The proposed approach adapts and fine-tunes compact LLMs such as DistilBERT to distinguish cyberattacks from actual faults using textualized multidimensional TCDR current measurements recorded before and after tripping. Our results demonstrate that DistilBERT detects 97.6% of cyberattacks without compromising TCDR dependability and achieves inference latency below 6 ms on a commercial workstation. Additional evaluations confirm the framework's robustness under combined time-synchronization and false-data-injection attacks, resilience to measurement noise, and stability across prompt formulation variants. Furthermore, GPT-2 and DistilBERT+LoRA achieve comparable performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs for enhancing smart grid cybersecurity. We provide the full dataset used in this study for reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出DP - MGTD框架解决机器生成文本检测中隐私与检测准确性的冲突，实验表明该方法检测准确率高且满足隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器生成文本检测系统处理敏感用户数据时，存在作者身份验证和隐私保护的冲突，现有方法有局限性。

Method: 提出DP - MGTD框架，采用两阶段机制，对数值和文本实体分别应用拉普拉斯和指数机制，动态校准隐私预算。

Result: 在MGTBench - 2.0数据集上实验，该方法接近完美的检测准确率，显著优于非隐私基线。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决机器生成文本检测中的隐私与检测准确性的矛盾，满足严格隐私保证。

Abstract: The deployment of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection systems necessitates processing sensitive user data, creating a fundamental conflict between authorship verification and privacy preservation. Standard anonymization techniques often disrupt linguistic fluency, while rigorous Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms typically degrade the statistical signals required for accurate detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose \textbf{DP-MGTD}, a framework incorporating an Adaptive Differentially Private Entity Sanitization algorithm. Our approach utilizes a two-stage mechanism that performs noisy frequency estimation and dynamically calibrates privacy budgets, applying Laplace and Exponential mechanisms to numerical and textual entities respectively. Crucially, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon where the application of DP noise amplifies the distinguishability between human and machine text by exposing distinct sensitivity patterns to perturbation. Extensive experiments on the MGTBench-2.0 dataset show that our method achieves near-perfect detection accuracy, significantly outperforming non-private baselines while satisfying strict privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 提出有效检测内部威胁的方法。

Method: 构建混合框架，结合多智能体模拟、分层安全信息与事件管理关联等技术，评估四种系统变体。

Result: CE - SIEM实现完美召回，提高F1值；EG - SIEM进一步提高F1值和确认警报精度，降低误报；EG - SIEM - Enron保持高精度，略微提高F1值并减少检测延迟。

Conclusion: 认知上下文提高敏感性，证据验证实现高精度低噪声检测，预训练通信校准可加速高置信度内部威胁识别。

Abstract: We present a hybrid framework for adaptive insider-threat detection that tightly integrates multi-agent simulation (MAS), layered Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) correlation, behavioral and communication forensics, trust-aware machine learning, and Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning. Intelligent agents operate in a simulated enterprise environment, generating both behavioral events and cognitive intent signals that are ingested by a centralized SIEM. We evaluate four system variants: a Layered SIEM-Core (LSC) baseline, a Cognitive-Enriched SIEM (CE-SIEM) incorporating ToM and communication forensics, an Evidence-Gated SIEM (EG-SIEM) introducing precision-focused validation mechanisms, and an Enron-enabled EG-SIEM (EG-SIEM-Enron) that augments evidence gating with a pretrained email forensics module calibrated on Enron corpora. Across ten simulation runs involving eight malicious insiders, CE-SIEM achieves perfect recall (1.000) and improves actor-level F1 from 0.521 (LSC) to 0.774. EG-SIEM raises actor-level F1 to 0.922 and confirmed-alert precision to 0.997 while reducing false positives to 0.2 per run. EG-SIEM-Enron preserves high precision (1.000 confirmed-alert precision; 0.0 false positives per run), slightly improves actor-level F1 to 0.933, and reduces detection latency (average TTD 10.26 steps versus 15.20 for EG-SIEM). These results demonstrate that cognitive context improves sensitivity, evidence-gated validation enables high-precision, low-noise detection, and pretrained communication calibration can further accelerate high-confidence insider threat identification.

TL;DR: 现有多变量时间序列（MTS）预测的后门攻击存在局限性，本文提出TDBA框架，实现灵活激活，实验显示其有效性和隐蔽性好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTS预测的后门攻击对触发器和目标模式有严格时空耦合要求，而现实场景需要延迟和变量特定激活，因此提出新技术满足需求。

Method: 提出TDBA框架，包含位置引导的触发生成机制和位置感知的优化模块。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，TDBA在有效性上始终优于现有基线，同时保持良好隐蔽性；消融研究证实其设计的可控性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TDBA框架在MTS预测的后门攻击中表现出色，能满足现实场景需求。

Abstract: Existing backdoor attacks on multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting enforce strict temporal and dimensional coupling between triggers and target patterns, requiring synchronous activation at fixed positions across variables. However, realistic scenarios often demand delayed and variable-specific activation. We identify this critical unmet need and propose TDBA, a temporally decoupled backdoor attack framework for MTS forecasting. By injecting triggers that encode the expected location of the target pattern, TDBA enables the activation of the target pattern at any positions within the forecasted data, with the activation position flexibly varying across different variable dimensions. TDBA introduces two core modules: (1) a position-guided trigger generation mechanism that leverages smoothed Gaussian priors to generate triggers that are position-related to the predefined target pattern; and (2) a position-aware optimization module that assigns soft weights based on trigger completeness, pattern coverage, and temporal offset, facilitating targeted and stealthy attack optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that TDBA consistently outperforms existing baselines in effectiveness while maintaining good stealthiness. Ablation studies confirm the controllability and robustness of its design.

Method: 提出Shadow Unlearning范式，设计Neuro - Semantic Projector Unlearning (NSPU)框架，编译Multi - domain Fictitious Unlearning (MuFU)遗忘集并引入评估体系。

Result: 在多个LLMs上实验表明，NSPU遗忘性能优，能保留模型效用，增强用户隐私，且计算效率至少比标准方法高10倍。

Conclusion: 为兼顾数据保护和模型保真的隐私感知机器学习遗忘指明新方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of specific training samples to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR's 'Right to be Forgotten'. However, many existing methods require access to the data being removed, exposing it to membership inference attacks and potential misuse of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We address this critical challenge by proposing Shadow Unlearning, a novel paradigm of approximate unlearning, that performs machine unlearning on anonymized forget data without exposing PII. We further propose a novel privacy-preserving framework, Neuro-Semantic Projector Unlearning (NSPU) to achieve Shadow unlearning. To evaluate our method, we compile Multi-domain Fictitious Unlearning (MuFU) forget set across five diverse domains and introduce an evaluation stack to quantify the trade-off between knowledge retention and unlearning effectiveness. Experimental results on various LLMs show that NSPU achieves superior unlearning performance, preserves model utility, and enhances user privacy. Additionally, the proposed approach is at least 10 times more computationally efficient than standard unlearning approaches. Our findings foster a new direction for privacy-aware machine unlearning that balances data protection and model fidelity.

Conclusion: 决策敏感信任信号对应方案有助于提升SOC警报分类的决策性能。

Abstract: Detection systems that utilize machine learning are progressively implemented at Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to help an analyst to filter through high volumes of security alerts. Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark. According to simulation findings, false negatives are greatly amplified by the presence of misaligned displays of confidence, whereas cost weighted loss decreases by orders of magnitude between models with decision aligned trust signals. Lastly, we describe a human-in-the-loop study plan that would allow empirically assessing the decision-making of the analysts with aligned and misaligned trust interfaces.

Abstract: We introduce enhanced Constitutional Classifiers that deliver production-grade jailbreak robustness with dramatically reduced computational costs and refusal rates compared to previous-generation defenses. Our system combines several key insights. First, we develop exchange classifiers that evaluate model responses in their full conversational context, which addresses vulnerabilities in last-generation systems that examine outputs in isolation. Second, we implement a two-stage classifier cascade where lightweight classifiers screen all traffic and escalate only suspicious exchanges to more expensive classifiers. Third, we train efficient linear probe classifiers and ensemble them with external classifiers to simultaneously improve robustness and reduce computational costs. Together, these techniques yield a production-grade system achieving a 40x computational cost reduction compared to our baseline exchange classifier, while maintaining a 0.05% refusal rate on production traffic. Through extensive red-teaming comprising over 1,700 hours, we demonstrate strong protection against universal jailbreaks -- no attack on this system successfully elicited responses to all eight target queries comparable in detail to an undefended model. Our work establishes Constitutional Classifiers as practical and efficient safeguards for large language models.

Abstract: The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, driven by increased digitalization and new cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity programs often fail to equip graduates with skills demanded by the workforce, particularly concerning recent developments in cybersecurity, as curriculum design is costly and labor-intensive. To address this misalignment, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for automated design and analysis of cybersecurity curricula, called CurricuLLM. Our approach provides three key contributions: (1) automation of personalized curriculum design, (2) a data-driven pipeline aligned with industry demands, and (3) a comprehensive methodology for leveraging fine-tuned LLMs in curriculum development.
  CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity. We systematically evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on foundational cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies.
  We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis. Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs. This lays the foundation for personalized, workforce-aligned cybersecurity curricula that prepare students for the evolving demands in cybersecurity.

Motivation: 改进浮点可满足性问题的求解方法，提高求解的可扩展性、准确性和速度。

Method: 将浮点公式在三个精度递增阶段转化为一系列优化问题，引入部分单调下降属性，将复杂算术视为黑盒。

Conclusion: 分阶段优化显著提高了浮点可满足性求解的性能和正确性。

Abstract: This work introduces StageSAT, a new approach to solving floating-point satisfiability that bridges SMT solving with numerical optimization. StageSAT reframes a floating-point formula as a series of optimization problems in three stages of increasing precision. It begins with a fast, projection-aided descent objective to guide the search toward a feasible region, proceeding to bit-level accuracy with ULP$^2$ optimization and a final $n$-ULP lattice refinement.
  By construction, the final stage uses a representing function that is zero if and only if a candidate satisfies all constraints. Thus, when optimization drives the objective to zero, the resulting assignment is a valid solution, providing a built-in guarantee of soundness.
  To improve search, StageSAT introduces a partial monotone descent property on linear constraints via orthogonal projection, preventing the optimizer from stalling on flat or misleading landscapes. Critically, this solver requires no heavy bit-level reasoning or specialized abstractions; it treats complex arithmetic as a black-box, using runtime evaluations to navigate the input space.
  We implement StageSAT and evaluate it on extensive benchmarks, including SMT-COMP'25 suites and difficult cases from prior work. StageSAT proved more scalable and accurate than state-of-the-art optimization-based alternatives. It solved strictly more formulas than any competing solver under the same time budget, finding most satisfiable instances without producing spurious models. This amounts to 99.4% recall on satisfiable cases with 0% false SAT, exceeding the reliability of prior optimization-based solvers. StageSAT also delivered significant speedups (often 5--10$\times$) over traditional bit-precise SMT and numeric solvers. These results demonstrate that staged optimization significantly improves performance and correctness of floating-point satisfiability solving.

Motivation: 传统优化计量方法缺乏灵活性，现有MARL方法过度拟合特定空域结构，需要提高其泛化能力。

Method: 将MARL问题转换到相对极坐标状态空间，训练Transformer编码器模型，评估不同编码器深度和空域结构。

Result: 单编码器配置表现优于更深层变体和纯注意力基线模型，近空中碰撞率接近零，分离损失侵犯时间更短。

Conclusion: 新的状态表示、神经网络架构设计和训练策略，为结构化和非结构化空域中的飞机分隔保证提供了可适应和可扩展的分散解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional optimization-based metering depends on strict adherence to precomputed schedules, which limits the flexibility required for the stochastic operations of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). In contrast, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a decentralized, adaptive framework that can better handle uncertainty, required for safe aircraft separation assurance. Despite this advantage, current MARL approaches often overfit to specific airspace structures, limiting their adaptability to new configurations. To improve generalization, we recast the MARL problem in a relative polar state space and train a transformer encoder model across diverse traffic patterns and intersection angles. The learned model provides speed advisories to resolve conflicts while maintaining aircraft near their desired cruising speeds. In our experiments, we evaluated encoder depths of 1, 2, and 3 layers in both structured and unstructured airspaces, and found that a single encoder configuration outperformed deeper variants, yielding near-zero near mid-air collision rates and shorter loss-of-separation infringements than the deeper configurations. Additionally, we showed that the same configuration outperforms a baseline model designed purely with attention. Together, our results suggest that the newly formulated state representation, novel design of neural network architecture, and proposed training strategy provide an adaptable and scalable decentralized solution for aircraft separation assurance in both structured and unstructured airspaces.

Abstract: Multiagent reinforcement learning, as a prominent intelligent paradigm, enables collaborative decision-making within complex systems. However, existing approaches often rely on explicit action exchange between agents to evaluate action value functions, which is frequently impractical in real-world engineering environments due to communication constraints, latency, energy consumption, and reliability requirements. From an artificial intelligence perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced multiagent reinforcement learning framework that employs action estimation neural networks to infer agent behaviors. By integrating a lightweight action estimation module, each agent infers neighboring agents' behaviors using only locally observable information, enabling collaborative policy learning without explicit action sharing. This approach is fully compatible with standard TD3 algorithms and scalable to larger multiagent systems. At the engineering application level, this framework has been implemented and validated in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks: two robotic arms collaboratively lift objects. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness and deployment feasibility of real-world robotic systems while reducing dependence on information infrastructure. Overall, this research advances the development of decentralized multiagent artificial intelligence systems while enabling AI to operate effectively in dynamic, information-constrained real-world environments.

Method: 提出UNIC框架，以数据驱动方式将视觉观测与本体感受和触觉模态融合，引入基于场景可供性图的统一接触表示和带随机掩码的多模态融合机制。

Result: UNIC表现可靠，在未见接触位置上平均倒角距离误差为9.6毫米，对未见对象表现良好，在缺失模态时保持鲁棒，能适应动态相机视角。

Conclusion: 外在接触估计可成为富接触操作实用且通用的能力。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation requires reliable estimation of extrinsic contacts-the interactions between a grasped object and its environment which provide essential contextual information for planning, control, and policy learning. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as predefined contact types, fixed grasp configurations, or camera calibration, that hinder generalization to novel objects and deployment in unstructured environments. In this paper, we present UNIC, a unified multimodal framework for extrinsic contact estimation that operates without any prior knowledge or camera calibration. UNIC directly encodes visual observations in the camera frame and integrates them with proprioceptive and tactile modalities in a fully data-driven manner. It introduces a unified contact representation based on scene affordance maps that captures diverse contact formations and employs a multimodal fusion mechanism with random masking, enabling robust multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIC performs reliably. It achieves a 9.6 mm average Chamfer distance error on unseen contact locations, performs well on unseen objects, remains robust under missing modalities, and adapts to dynamic camera viewpoints. These results establish extrinsic contact estimation as a practical and versatile capability for contact-rich manipulation.

Abstract: This study focuses on optimizing path planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in precision agriculture using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in continuous action spaces. The research begins with a review of traditional grid-based methods, such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithms, and discusses their limitations in dynamic agricultural environments, highlighting the need for adaptive learning strategies. The study then explores DRL approaches, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which demonstrate improved adaptability and performance in two-dimensional simulations. Enhancements such as Double Q-Networks and Dueling Networks are evaluated to further improve decision-making. Building on these results, the focus shifts to continuous action space models, specifically Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), which are tested in increasingly complex environments. Experiments conducted in a three-dimensional environment using ROS and Gazebo demonstrate the effectiveness of continuous DRL algorithms in navigating dynamic agricultural scenarios. Notably, the pretrained TD3 agent achieves a 95 percent success rate in dynamic environments, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach in handling moving obstacles while ensuring safety for both crops and the robot.

Result: 通过大量实验证明了SeqWalker模型的优越性。

Conclusion: SeqWalker模型能有效解决SH - VLN场景下多任务导航问题。

Abstract: Sequential-Horizon Vision-and-Language Navigation (SH-VLN) presents a challenging scenario where agents should sequentially execute multi-task navigation guided by complex, long-horizon language instructions. Current vision-and-language navigation models exhibit significant performance degradation with such multi-task instructions, as information overload impairs the agent's ability to attend to observationally relevant details. To address this problem, we propose SeqWalker, a navigation model built on a hierarchical planning framework. Our SeqWalker features: i) A High-Level Planner that dynamically selects global instructions into contextually relevant sub-instructions based on the agent's current visual observations, thus reducing cognitive load; ii) A Low-Level Planner incorporating an Exploration-Verification strategy that leverages the inherent logical structure of instructions for trajectory error correction. To evaluate SH-VLN performance, we also extend the IVLN dataset and establish a new benchmark. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SeqWalker.

Motivation: 辅助设备需判断用户意图及预测可靠性，原始模型置信度常不能反映真实正确性，存在安全风险。

Method: 采用事后校准使预测置信度与经验可靠性一致，通过校准后的置信度驱动ACT/HOLD规则。

Result: 事后校准将误校准降低约一个数量级且不影响准确性，使置信阈值成为辅助动作的定量安全参数。

Conclusion: 该框架可在辅助控制循环中实现可验证的行为。

Abstract: Assistive devices must determine both what a user intends to do and how reliable that prediction is before providing support. We introduce a safety-critical triggering framework based on calibrated probabilities for multimodal next-action prediction in Activities of Daily Living. Raw model confidence often fails to reflect true correctness, posing a safety risk. Post-hoc calibration aligns predicted confidence with empirical reliability and reduces miscalibration by about an order of magnitude without affecting accuracy. The calibrated confidence drives a simple ACT/HOLD rule that acts only when reliability is high and withholds assistance otherwise. This turns the confidence threshold into a quantitative safety parameter for assisted actions and enables verifiable behavior in an assistive control loop.

*Zimo Yan,Zheng Xie,Runfan Duan,Chang Liu,Wumei Du*

TL;DR: 研究分子图学习中位置信号，解读距离编码与扩散几何关系，在药物图上验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子图学习中两种常用位置编码关系不明，需深入研究。

Method: 将距离编码解释为扩散几何的低秩替代，推导三边测量映射，用基于GNP的DDI预测骨干在DrugBank分子图上实验。

Result: 距离驱动的Nyström方案能恢复扩散几何，拉普拉斯和距离编码表现优于无编码基线。

Conclusion: 明确了距离编码与扩散几何的关系，证明两种编码在分子图学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Molecular graph learning benefits from positional signals that capture both local neighborhoods and global topology. Two widely used families are spectral encodings derived from Laplacian or diffusion operators and anchor-based distance encodings built from shortest-path information, yet their precise relationship is poorly understood. We interpret distance encodings as a low-rank surrogate of diffusion geometry and derive an explicit trilateration map that reconstructs truncated diffusion coordinates from transformed anchor distances and anchor spectral positions, with pointwise and Frobenius-gap guarantees on random regular graphs. On DrugBank molecular graphs using a shared GNP-based DDI prediction backbone, a distance-driven Nyström scheme closely recovers diffusion geometry, and both Laplacian and distance encodings substantially outperform a no-encoding baseline.

### [264] [Constrained Assortment and Price Optimization under Generalized Nested Logit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04220)

Method: 将问题重新表述为双线性和指数锥凸规划问题，在分支切割框架中利用凸性、凹性和子模性生成强切割平面；对连续定价情况提出基于分段线性近似的近似精确算法。

Result: 方法在解的质量和可扩展性方面显著优于现有近似方法，能解决大规模实例，获得连续定价问题的近似最优解。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了GNL模型下商品组合和价格优化的几个开放性问题。

Abstract: We study assortment and price optimization under the generalized nested logit (GNL) model, one of the most general and flexible modeling frameworks in discrete choice modeling. Despite its modeling advantages, optimization under GNL is highly challenging: even the pure assortment problem is NP-hard, and existing approaches rely on approximation schemes or are limited to simple cardinality constraints. In this paper, we develop the first exact and near-exact algorithms for constrained assortment and joint assortment--pricing optimization (JAP) under GNL. Our approach reformulates the problem into bilinear and exponential-cone convex programs and exploits convexity, concavity, and submodularity properties to generate strong cutting planes within a Branch-and-Cut framework (B\&C). We further extend this framework to the mixed GNL (MGNL) model, capturing heterogeneous customer segments, and to JAP with discrete prices. For the continuous pricing case, we propose a near-exact algorithm based on piecewise-linear approximation (PWLA) that achieves arbitrarily high precision under general linear constraints. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that our methods substantially outperform state-of-the-art approximation approaches in both solution quality and scalability. In particular, we are able to solve large-scale instances with up to 1000 products and 20 nests, and to obtain near-optimal solutions for continuous pricing problems with negligible optimality gaps. To the best of our knowledge, this work resolves several open problems in assortment and price optimization under GNL.

TL;DR: 本文提出用幂变换解决EGM与Epstein - Zin偏好不兼容的问题，算法无需求根，有显著速度和精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内点网格法（EGM）与Epstein - Zin偏好不兼容，需解决此问题以利用EGM加速动态规划。

Method: 采用幂变换解决EGM与Epstein - Zin偏好不兼容问题。

Result: 算法无需求根，速度比价值函数迭代快1 - 2个数量级，精度提高超1个数量级，保持精度时加速2 - 3个数量级。

Conclusion: VFI和时间迭代存在速度 - 精度权衡，EGM可完全避开此问题。

Abstract: The endogenous grid method (EGM) accelerates dynamic programming by inverting the Euler equation, but it appears incompatible with Epstein-Zin preferences where the value function enters the Euler equation. This paper shows that a power transformation resolves the difficulty. The resulting algorithm requires no root-finding, achieves speed gains of one to two orders of magnitude over value function iteration, and improves accuracy by more than one order of magnitude. Holding accuracy constant, the speedup is two to three orders of magnitude. VFI and time iteration face a speed-accuracy tradeoff; EGM sidesteps it entirely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于美国司法部针对中国科学家以及中国科学家对美国科学的贡献，有必要调查美国学术界反华歧视的表现和细节。

Method: 以美国前100的社会学、经济学、化学和物理学系全体教师为样本，采用精确匹配方法。

Result: 中国女科学家在女性教授中占比高于中国男科学家在男性教授中的占比；中国男科学家有显著引用惩罚，中国女科学家有持续引用奖励。

Conclusion: 在获得特定声望的终身教职岗位时，中国女科学家比非华裔女性所需引用少，中国男科学家比非华裔男性所需引用多。

Abstract: Given the recent targeting of Chinese scientists by the Department of Justice and sizable contributions of Chinese scientists to American science, it is urgent to investigate the presence and the particulars of anti-Chinese discrimination in the American academy. Across a sample of all faculty in the top 100 departments of sociology, economics, chemistry, and physics in the United States, we show that female Chinese scientists comprise a much higher percentage of the female professoriate than male Chinese scientists in the male professoriate. Using an exact matching approach, we then find that male Chinese scientists suffer from a dramatic citation penalty but that female Chinese scientists enjoy a persistent citation bonus. On average, female Chinese scientists require fewer citations on average than non-Chinese women where male Chinese scientists require more citations than their non-Chinese counterparts to attain a tenure-track professorial job of a given prestige rating.

*Wen Lou,Adrián A. Díaz-Faes,Jiangen He,Zhihao Liu,Vincent Larivière*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 分析2000 - 2024年超6.2万项随机对照试验，发现临床试验参与的全球不平等主要由国家而非疾病决定，仅靠疾病垂直策略无法纠正参与不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究临床试验参与是否反映全球疾病负担，即明确其参与情况是否合理。

Method: 分析超6.2万项涵盖16种主要疾病类别的随机对照试验，将3680万试验参与者与国家层面疾病负担关联。

Result: 临床试验参与的全球不平等主要由国家而非疾病决定，国家层面因素解释超90%的参与差异，疾病特定效应影响小，参与高度集中在少数国家且模式长期未变。

Conclusion: 仅靠疾病垂直策略无法纠正参与不平等，需进行跨疾病领域的横向投资以减少全球临床研究的不平等。

Abstract: Clinical trials shape medical evidence and determine who gains access to experimental therapies. Whether participation in these trials reflects the global burden of disease remains unclear. Here we analyze participation inequality across more than 62,000 randomized controlled trials spanning 16 major disease categories from 2000 to 2024. Linking 36.8 million trial participants to country-level disease burden, we show that global inequality in clinical trial participation is overwhelmingly structured by country rather than disease. Country-level factors explain over 90% of variation in participation, whereas disease-specific effects contribute only marginally. Removing entire disease categories, including those traditionally considered underfunded, has little effect on overall inequality. Instead, participation is highly concentrated geographically, with a small group of countries enrolling a disproportionate share of participants across nearly all diseases. These patterns have persisted despite decades of disease-targeted funding and increasing alignment between research attention and disease burden within diseases. Our findings indicate that disease-vertical strategies alone cannot correct participation inequality. Reducing global inequities in clinical research requires horizontal investments in research capacity, health infrastructure, and governance that operate across disease domains.

TL;DR: 本文构建动态模型探讨企业投资目标感以提升工作意义等情况，分析了均衡状态，研究意义和目标感的影响因素，指出利润最大化企业在目标感投资上不足，强调技能异质性和多样性的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工人看重工作的意义，企业需将其偏好与利润目标结合，试图研究企业如何投资目标感来实现此结合。

Method: 建立一个动态模型，其中企业投资目标感，工人根据自身生产力选择生产和社交努力，分析均衡及相关动态。

Result: 意义和目标感与工人对意义的重视程度和企业耐心正相关，与折旧和社交成本负相关，与工人产出份额呈非单调关系，一定技能异质性对绩效最优，利润最大化企业在目标感上投资不足。

Conclusion: 模型有助于理解企业采用目标驱动实践的时机和原因，强调多样性在工作中创造意义的作用。

Abstract: Many workers value purpose and meaning in their jobs alongside income, and firms need to align these preferences with profit goals. This paper develops a dynamic model in which firms invest in purpose to enhance job meaning and motivate effort. Workers, who differ in productivity, choose both productive and socialization effort, gaining utility from income and meaning. Purpose accumulates over time through firm investment and interacts with socialization to generate meaning, which boosts productivity. Firms invest in purpose only insofar as it raises profits. We characterize the unique equilibrium, including steady state and transition dynamics. Meaning and purpose rise with the importance workers place on meaning and with firm's patience, but fall with depreciation and socialization costs. The relationship with workers' share of output is nonmonotonic. We also show that some intermediate level of heterogeneity in skills is best for performance. Compared to a worker-owned firm, profit-maximizing firms underinvest in purpose, highlighting a misalignment between firm incentives and worker preferences. The model provides insight into when and why firms adopt purpose-driven practices and underscores the role of diversity in fostering meaning at work.

Motivation: 构建一个能综合考虑空间溢出、网络外部性及其相互作用的金融网络技术采纳分析框架。

Method: 构建统一框架，通过主方程刻画采纳动态，推导采纳放大因子，采用Levy跳 - 扩散扩展，应用于SWIFT gpi在17家全球系统重要性银行的采纳情况分析。

Result: 网络中心银行采纳显著更早；阈值前采纳者放大因子显著高于阈值后；创始成员占比小但对系统放大贡献大；控制相关因素后，CEO年龄使采纳延迟。

Conclusion: 所构建的框架能有效分析金融网络技术采纳，两阶段特征得到验证，多种因素影响技术采纳。

Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($ρ= -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics. Controlling for firm size and network position, CEO age delays adoption by 11-15 days per year.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising application domain for near-term quantum hardware, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical models that leverage both classical and quantum processing. Although numerous hybrid architectures have been proposed and demonstrated successfully on benchmark tasks, a significant open question remains regarding the specific contribution of quantum components to the overall performance of these models. In this work, we aim to shed light on the impact of quantum processing within hybrid quantum-classical neural network architectures through a rigorous statistical study. We systematically assess common hybrid models on medical signal data as well as planar and volumetric images, examining the influence attributable to classical and quantum aspects such as encoding schemes, entanglement, and circuit size. We find that in best-case scenarios, hybrid models show performance comparable to their classical counterparts, however, in most cases, performance metrics deteriorate under the influence of quantum components. Our multi-modal analysis provides realistic insights into the contributions of quantum components and advocates for cautious claims and design choices for hybrid models in near-term applications.

Conclusion: 暗示量子生成建模存在某种量子优势。

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is a very active area of research in looking for practical advantage in data analysis. Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling.

Conclusion: 理论引导的生成式AI代理可作为复杂社会系统决策和政策设计的强大计算模型。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed as quasi-autonomous systems for specialized tasks, yet their potential as computational models of decision-making remains underexplored. We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.

Conclusion: 结构化的智能体自反思结合人类监督和指导，可产生更高质量3D模型，且通过实时Blender同步保持高效工作流集成。

Abstract: We present a framework that extends the Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

Abstract: We build, deploy, and evaluate Paper Skygest, a custom personalized social feed for scientific content posted by a user's network on Bluesky and the AT Protocol. We leverage a new capability on emerging decentralized social media platforms: the ability for anyone to build and deploy feeds for other users, to use just as they would a native platform-built feed. To our knowledge, Paper Skygest is the first and largest such continuously deployed personalized social media feed by academics, with over 50,000 weekly uses by over 1,000 daily active users, all organically acquired. First, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate Paper Skygest usage, showing that it has sustained usage and satisfies users; we further show adoption of Paper Skygest increases a user's interactions with posts about research, and how interaction rates change as a function of post order. Second, we share our full code and describe our system architecture, to support other academics in building and deploying such feeds sustainably. Third, we overview the potential of custom feeds such as Paper Skygest for studying algorithm designs, building for user agency, and running recommender system experiments with organic users without partnering with a centralized platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纠正错误信息时用户常面临敌意和人身攻击，阻碍纠正讨论的参与，因此研究采用不同方式纠正错误信息的社会反应。

Method: 采用观察性设计，分析五个高冲突错误信息主题下的100条纠正回复，对比Grok介导和人类直接纠正的情况，并通过卡方检验分析结果。

Result: 人类直接纠正有72%受到人身攻击，Grok介导的纠正无一人身攻击，卡方检验显示两者关联有统计学意义且效应量较大。

Conclusion: 人工智能介导的错误信息纠正可减少人际敌意，改变公共分歧的社会动态。

Abstract: Correcting misinformation in public online spaces often exposes users to hostility and ad hominem attacks, discouraging participation in corrective discourse. This study presents empirical evidence that invoking Grok, the native large language model on X, rather than directly confronting other users, is associated with different social responses during misinformation correction. Using an observational design, 100 correction replies across five high-conflict misinformation topics were analyzed, with corrections balanced between Grok-mediated and direct human-issued responses. The primary outcome was whether a correction received at least one ad hominem attack within a 24-hour window. Ad hominem attacks occurred in 72 percent of human-issued corrections and in none of the Grok-mediated corrections. A chi-square test confirmed a statistically significant association with a large effect size. These findings suggest that AI-mediated correction may alter the social dynamics of public disagreement by reducing interpersonal hostility during misinformation responses.

Conclusion: GIT - CD是检测复杂社交网络中有意义社区的可靠方法。

Abstract: Community detection is crucial for applications like targeted marketing and recommendation systems. Traditional methods rely on network structure, and embedding-based models integrate semantic information. However, there is a challenge when a model leverages local and global information from complex structures like social networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown superior performance in capturing local and global relationships. In this paper, We propose Graph Integrated Transformer for Community Detection (GIT-CD), a hybrid model combining GNNs and Transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance community detection in social networks. Specifically, the GNN module captures local graph structures, while the Transformer module models long-range dependencies. A self-optimizing clustering module refines community assignments using K-Means, silhouette loss, and KL divergence minimization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GIT-CD outperforms state-of-the-art models, making it a robust approach for detecting meaningful communities in complex social networks.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to use Maximum Likelihood (ML) Classification on multispectral data by means of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Maximum Likelihood is a supervised classification algorithm which is based on the Classical Bayes theorem. It makes use of a discriminant function to assign pixel to the class with the highest likelihood. Class means vector and covariance matrix are the key inputs to the function and can be estimated from training pixels of a particular class. As Maximum Likelihood need some assumptions before it has to be applied on the data. In this paper we will compare the results of Maximum Likelihood Classification (ML) before apply the Weierstrass Transform and apply Weierstrass Transform and will see the difference between the accuracy on training pixels of high resolution Quickbird satellite image. Principle Component analysis (PCA) is also used for dimension reduction and also used to check the variation in bands. The results shows that the separation between mean of the classes in the decision space is to be the main factor that leads to the high classification accuracy of Maximum Likelihood (ML) after using Weierstrass Transform than without using it.

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a key tool for graphene characterization, yet its application to graphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) is strongly limited by the intense and variable second-order Raman response of the substrate. This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experimental variability of the substrate signal. Here we present SpectraFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model that reconstructs the SiC Raman substrate contribution directly from post-growth partially masked spectroscopic data without relying on explicit reference measurements. By learning global correlations across the entire Raman shift range, the model captures the statistical structure of the SiC background and enables accurate reconstruction of its contribution in mixed spectra. Subtraction of the reconstructed substrate signal reveals weak vibrational features associated with ZLG that are inaccessible through conventional analysis methods. The extracted spectra are validated by ab initio vibrational calculations, allowing assignment of the resolved features to specific modes and confirming their physical consistency. By leveraging a state-of-the-art attention-based deep learning architecture, this approach establishes a robust, reference-free framework for Raman analysis of graphene on SiC and provides a foundation, compatible with real-time data acquisition, to its integration into automated, closed-loop AI-assisted growth optimization.

Result: 相比之前CPU工作流程速度提高约五倍，结果相当，双级松弛方法提高复杂结构生成成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到多组分多环境系统，为生成目标局部环境的材料结构提供可扩展途径。

Abstract: We present a materials generation framework that couples a symmetry-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a differentiable SO(3) power spectrum objective to steer candidates toward a specified local environment under the crystallographic constraints. In particular, we implement a fully differentiable pipeline that performs batch-wise optimization on both direct and latent crystallographic representations. Using the GPU acceleration, the implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively overcome local barrier defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the targe local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment.

Result: 得到估计器的收敛率，证明学习的算子能诱导高效稳定的Galerkin求解器，其数值误差与统计精度匹配。

Conclusion: 研究有助于将算子学习、数据驱动求解器和小波方法在科学计算中结合起来。

Abstract: This paper establishes convergence rates for learning elliptic pseudo-differential operators, a fundamental operator class in partial differential equations and mathematical physics. In a wavelet-Galerkin framework, we formulate learning over this class as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to obtaining convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.

Motivation: 生成式音频技术增加通信渠道中冒名顶替、欺诈和虚假信息风险，需实时检测RVC生成的AI语音。

Method: 在DEEP - VOICE数据集上评估，对孤立人声应用深度伪造生成并重新引入背景氛围，将音频分割为一秒片段，提取时频和倒谱特征，训练监督机器学习模型分类。

Result: 短窗声学特征即使在嘈杂背景下也能可靠捕捉与RVC语音相关的判别模式。

Conclusion: 证明了实时深度伪造语音检测的可行性，强调在现实音频混合条件下评估对稳健部署的重要性。

Abstract: Generative audio technologies now enable highly realistic voice cloning and real-time voice conversion, increasing the risk of impersonation, fraud, and misinformation in communication channels such as phone and video calls. This study investigates real-time detection of AI-generated speech produced using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC), evaluated on the DEEP-VOICE dataset, which includes authentic and voice-converted speech samples from multiple well-known speakers. To simulate realistic conditions, deepfake generation is applied to isolated vocal components, followed by the reintroduction of background ambiance to suppress trivial artifacts and emphasize conversion-specific cues. We frame detection as a streaming classification task by dividing audio into one-second segments, extracting time-frequency and cepstral features, and training supervised machine learning models to classify each segment as real or voice-converted. The proposed system enables low-latency inference, supporting both segment-level decisions and call-level aggregation. Experimental results show that short-window acoustic features can reliably capture discriminative patterns associated with RVC speech, even in noisy backgrounds. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of practical, real-time deepfake speech detection and underscore the importance of evaluating under realistic audio mixing conditions for robust deployment.

Method: 提出SmoothSync框架，利用量化音频令牌和双流扩散变压器架构，融合音频 - 运动特征，引入抖动抑制损失，实现概率性音频量化；引入Smooth - BC指标评估节拍同步性。

Result: 在BEAT2和SHOW数据集上实验，SmoothSync在FGD、Smooth - BC和多样性指标上表现优越，分别相比现有方法提升 - 30.6%、10.3%和8.4%，同时减少62.9%的抖动和17.1%的脚步滑动。

Conclusion: SmoothSync框架显著优于现有共语音手势生成方法，代码将开源促进后续研究。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is a critical area of research aimed at synthesizing speech-synchronized human-like gestures. Existing methods often suffer from issues such as rhythmic inconsistency, motion jitter, foot sliding and limited multi-sampling diversity. In this paper, we present SmoothSync, a novel framework that leverages quantized audio tokens in a novel dual-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesis holistic gestures and enhance sampling variation. Specifically, we (1) fuse audio-motion features via complementary transformer streams to achieve superior synchronization, (2) introduce a jitter-suppression loss to improve temporal smoothness, (3) implement probabilistic audio quantization to generate distinct gesture sequences from identical inputs. To reliably evaluate beat synchronization under jitter, we introduce Smooth-BC, a robust variant of the beat consistency metric less sensitive to motion noise. Comprehensive experiments on the BEAT2 and SHOW datasets demonstrate SmoothSync's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by -30.6% FGD, 10.3% Smooth-BC, and 8.4% Diversity on BEAT2, while reducing jitter and foot sliding by -62.9% and -17.1% respectively. The code will be released to facilitate future research.

Result: 在五个音频分类数据集上相比经典提示集成方法有一致提升，准确率提升5倍。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，无需额外标签和低计算开销，可用于零样本音频分类。

Abstract: Audio-language models have recently demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities by leveraging natural-language supervision to classify audio events without labeled training data. Yet, their performance is highly sensitive to the wording of text prompts, with small variations leading to large fluctuations in accuracy. Prior work has mitigated this issue through prompt learning or prompt ensembling. However, these strategies either require annotated data or fail to account for the fact that some prompts may negatively impact performance. In this work, we present an entropy-guided prompt weighting approach that aims to find a robust combination of prompt contributions to maximize prediction confidence. To this end, we formulate a tailored objective function that minimizes prediction entropy to yield new prompt weights, utilizing low-entropy as a proxy for high confidence. Our approach can be applied to individual samples or a batch of audio samples, requiring no additional labels and incurring negligible computational overhead. Experiments on five audio classification datasets covering environmental, urban, and vocal sounds, demonstrate consistent gains compared to classical prompt ensembling methods in a zero-shot setting, with accuracy improvements 5-times larger across the whole benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的音频字幕框架LAMB，实现跨模态对齐，增强推理能力，在AudioCaps上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前方法未考虑跨模态对齐，未能充分利用大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力。

Method: 提出LAMB框架，包含最小化柯西 - 施瓦茨散度同时最大化互信息的跨模态对齐器、提取语义丰富音频嵌入的双流适配器和在LLM文本嵌入空间计算分数的Token Guide。

Result: 所提框架增强了LLM解码器的推理能力，在AudioCaps上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LAMB框架能有效解决跨模态对齐问题，提升音频字幕的质量。

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning aims to describe the semantic content of input audio. Recent works have employed large language models (LLMs) as a text decoder to leverage their reasoning capabilities. However, prior approaches that project audio features into the LLM embedding space without considering cross-modal alignment fail to fully utilize these capabilities. To address this, we propose LAMB, an LLM-based audio captioning framework that bridges the modality gap between audio embeddings and the LLM text embedding space. LAMB incorporates a Cross-Modal Aligner that minimizes Cauchy-Schwarz divergence while maximizing mutual information, yielding tighter alignment between audio and text at both global and token levels. We further design a Two-Stream Adapter that extracts semantically enriched audio embeddings, thereby delivering richer information to the Cross-Modal Aligner. Finally, leveraging the aligned audio embeddings, a proposed Token Guide directly computes scores within the LLM text embedding space to steer the output logits of generated captions. Experimental results confirm that our framework strengthens the reasoning capabilities of the LLM decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种音频半监督学习框架用于从语音声学检测医学状况，实验证明其效果好数据效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从语音声学检测医学状况是弱监督学习问题，存在数据稀缺、标注主观等问题，现有音频方法难以解决病理特征非均匀表达这一核心挑战。

Method: 提出一种仅音频的半监督学习框架，在未分割临床对话中联合从帧级、片段级和会话级表征学习，以动态聚合多粒度特征并生成高质量伪标签。

Result: 框架与模型无关，跨语言和疾病状况都很稳健，数据效率高，用仅11个标签样本就能达到全监督性能的90%。

Conclusion: 该工作为医学语音分析中弱远端监督学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Detecting medical conditions from speech acoustics is fundamentally a weakly-supervised learning problem: a single, often noisy, session-level label must be linked to nuanced patterns within a long, complex audio recording. This task is further hampered by severe data scarcity and the subjective nature of clinical annotations. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a viable path to leverage unlabeled data, existing audio methods often fail to address the core challenge that pathological traits are not uniformly expressed in a patient's speech. We propose a novel, audio-only SSL framework that explicitly models this hierarchy by jointly learning from frame-level, segment-level, and session-level representations within unsegmented clinical dialogues. Our end-to-end approach dynamically aggregates these multi-granularity features and generates high-quality pseudo-labels to efficiently utilize unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show the framework is model-agnostic, robust across languages and conditions, and highly data-efficient-achieving, for instance, 90\% of fully-supervised performance using only 11 labeled samples. This work provides a principled approach to learning from weak, far-end supervision in medical speech analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集搜索引擎依赖元数据质量和关键词重叠，难以捕捉科学研究语义意图，识别合适数据集有挑战。

Method: 结合大规模引文上下文提取、基于大语言模型的模式引导数据集识别和保留来源的实体解析。

Result: 在八个计算机科学查询中召回率高于Google Dataset Search和DataCite Commons，发现额外未记录数据集，专家评估部分额外数据集实用且新颖。

Conclusion: 引文上下文挖掘是有效且可推广的数据集发现范式，尤其适用于元数据不足或不可靠的情况。

Abstract: Identifying suitable datasets for a research question remains challenging because existing dataset search engines rely heavily on metadata quality and keyword overlap, which often fail to capture the semantic intent of scientific investigation. We introduce a literature-driven framework that discovers datasets from citation contexts in scientific papers, enabling retrieval grounded in actual research use rather than metadata availability. Our approach combines large-scale citation-context extraction, schema-guided dataset recognition with Large Language Models, and provenance-preserving entity resolution. We evaluate the system on eight survey-derived computer science queries and find that it achieves substantially higher recall than Google Dataset Search and DataCite Commons, with normalized recall ranging from an average of 47.47% to a highest value of 81.82%. Beyond recovering gold-standard datasets, the method also surfaces additional datasets not documented in the surveys. Expert assessments across five top-level Fields of Science indicate that a substantial portion of the additional datasets are considered high utility, and some are regarded as novel for the specific topics chosen by the experts. These findings establish citation-context mining as an effective and generalizable paradigm for dataset discovery, particularly in settings where datasets lack sufficient or reliable metadata. To support reproducibility and future extensions, we release our code, evaluation datasets, and results on GitHub (https://github.com/Fireblossom/citation-context-dataset-discovery).

Motivation: 社会科学家研究大学回报因种族和性别而异的问题时，面临两种不同探究模式的选择，需一个导航框架来处理。

Method: 提出导航框架，并通过模拟展示演绎和归纳两种方法在不同场景的优势。

Result: 发现演绎和归纳的选择体现了可解释性和灵活性的权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架对不平等研究很重要，有助于理解不同社会子群体的治疗效果差异。

Abstract: When sociologists and other social scientist ask whether the return to college differs by race and gender, they face a choice between two fundamentally different modes of inquiry. Traditional interaction models follow deductive logic: the researcher specifies which variables moderate effects and tests these hypotheses. Machine learning methods follow inductive logic: algorithms search across vast combinatorial spaces to discover patterns of heterogeneity. This article develops a framework for navigating between these approaches. We show that the choice between deduction and induction reflects a tradeoff between interpretability and flexibility, and we demonstrate through simulation when each approach excels. Our framework is particularly relevant for inequality research, where understanding how treatment effects vary across intersecting social subpopulation is substantively central.

Abstract: Background. Reproducibility is essential to the scientific method, but reproduction is often a laborious task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process and relieve researchers of this workload. However, due to varying definitions of reproducibility, a clear problem statement is missing. Objectives. Create a generalisable problem statement, applicable to any empirical study. We hypothesise that we can represent any empirical study using a structure based on the scientific method and that this representation can be automatically extracted from any publication, and captures the essence of the study. Methods. We apply our definition of reproducibility as a problem statement for the automatisation of reproducibility by automatically extracting the hypotheses, experiments and interpretations of 20 studies and assess the quality based on assessments by the original authors of each study. Results. We create a dataset representing the reproducibility problem, consisting of the representation of 20 studies. The majority of author feedback is positive, for all parts of the representation. In a few cases, our method failed to capture all elements of the study. We also find room for improvement at capturing specific details, such as results of experiments. Conclusions. We conclude that our formulation of the problem is able to capture the concept of reproducibility in empirical AI studies across a wide range of subfields. Authors of original publications generally agree that the produced structure is representative of their work; we believe improvements can be achieved by applying our findings to create a more structured and fine-grained output in future work.

Method: 提出Generative Teaching范式，让教育者成为高级导演，引入TeachMaster多智能体框架，以代码为中间语义介质，协调规划、设计和渲染等多智能体协作。

Result: 实验验证TeachMaster能显著提高生产效率，且不影响结构连贯性和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: TeachMaster为可扩展教育提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: The scalability of high-quality online education is hindered by the high costs and slow cycles of labor-intensive manual content creation. Despite advancements in video generation, current approaches often fail to ensure pedagogical structure and precise control due to their pixel-level, black-box nature. In this paper, we propose Generative Teaching, a novel paradigm that transitions educators from manual creators to high-level directors, allowing them to focus on pedagogical intent while autonomous agents handle the execution. To realize this vision, we introduce TeachMaster, a multi-agent framework that leverages code as an intermediate semantic medium. Unlike traditional video generation methods, TeachMaster orchestrates a collaborative team of agents--spanning planning, design, and rendering--to automate the production of interpretable, editable, and curriculum-ready educational videos. Experiments validate that TeachMaster significantly boosts production efficiency without compromising structural coherence or visual fidelity, providing a robust solution for scalable education.

Conclusion: 建议将要求转化为整合儿童权利影响评估、持续监测指标和申诉纠正程序的可审计闭环治理。

Abstract: This paper tackles practical challenges in governing child centered artificial intelligence: policy texts state principles and requirements but often lack reproducible evidence anchors, explicit causal pathways, executable governance toolchains, and computable audit metrics. We propose Graph-GAP, a methodology that decomposes requirements from authoritative policy texts into a four layer graph of evidence, mechanism, governance, and indicator, and that computes two metrics, GAP score and mitigation readiness, to identify governance gaps and prioritise actions. Using the UNICEF Innocenti Guidance on AI and Children 3.0 as primary material, we define reproducible extraction units, coding manuals, graph patterns, scoring scales, and consistency checks, and we demonstrate exemplar gap profiles and governance priority matrices for ten requirements. Results suggest that compared with privacy and data protection, requirements related to child well being and development, explainability and accountability, and cross agency implementation and resource allocation are more prone to indicator gaps and mechanism gaps. We recommend translating requirements into auditable closed loop governance that integrates child rights impact assessments, continuous monitoring metrics, and grievance redress procedures. At the coding level, we introduce a multi algorithm review aggregation revision workflow that runs rule based encoders, statistical or machine learning evaluators, and large model evaluators with diverse prompt configurations as parallel coders. Each extraction unit outputs evidence, mechanism, governance, and indicator labels plus readiness scores with evidence anchors. Reliability, stability, and uncertainty are assessed using Krippendorff alpha, weighted kappa, intraclass correlation, and bootstrap confidence intervals.

Abstract: The use of large language model (LLM)-based AI chatbots among college students has increased rapidly, yet little is known about how individual psychological attributes shape students' interaction patterns with these technologies. This qualitative study explored how college students with different attachment styles describe their interactions with ChatGPT. Using semi-structured interviews with seven undergraduate students and grounded theory analysis, we identified three main themes: (1) AI as a low-risk emotional space, where participants across attachment styles valued the non-judgmental and low-stakes nature of AI interactions; (2) attachment-congruent patterns of AI engagement, where securely attached students integrated AI as a supplementary tool within their existing support systems, while avoidantly attached students used AI to buffer vulnerability and maintain interpersonal boundaries; and (3) the paradox of AI intimacy, capturing the tension between students' willingness to disclose personal information to AI while simultaneously recognizing its limitations as a relational partner. These findings suggest that attachment orientations play an important role in shaping how students experience and interpret their interactions with AI chatbots, extending attachment theory to the domain of human-AI interaction.

Abstract: The artificial intelligence value chain is one of the main concepts underpinning the European legislation on the subject, especially the Artificial Intelligence Act. It is an economic concept that has become a legal one. i.e., a concept of legal governance, due to its continued use in policy documents and legal texts. This article (i) analyses its significance and function within the framework of the regulatory strategy established by recent EU programs (the Compass for Competitiveness, the Action Plan, Apply AI Strategy, and the Digital Omnibus on AI), (ii) identifies its limitations, and (iii) advances the theoretical construction of value chains that capture intangible dimensions that are not directly monetizable (such as language, culture, and, especially, ethical and legal values) but have a significant impact on the social environment. It also briefly compares three different legal frameworks for the regulation of AI (EU, Commonwealth and USA). It proposes at the end a specific framework for the analysis of the ethical and legal AI value chain to preserve democratic values and foster the digital implementation of the rule of law.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-scale language models (LLMs) has shown their potential to transform intelligent education systems (IESs) through automated teaching and learning support applications. However, current IESs often rely on single-turn static question-answering, which fails to assess learners' cognitive levels, cannot adjust teaching strategies based on real-time feedback, and is limited to providing simple one-off responses. To address these issues, we introduce AgentTutor, a multi-turn interactive intelligent education system to empower personalized learning. It features an LLM-powered generative multi-agent system and a learner-specific personalized learning profile environment that dynamically optimizes and delivers teaching strategies based on learners' learning status, personalized goals, learning preferences, and multimodal study materials. It includes five key modules: curriculum decomposition, learner assessment, dynamic strategy, teaching reflection, and knowledge & experience memory. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, AgentTutor significantly enhances learners' performance while demonstrating strong effectiveness in multi-turn interactions and competitiveness in teaching quality among other baselines.

Abstract: Claims about whether large language model (LLM) chatbots "reason" are typically debated using curated benchmarks and laboratory-style evaluation protocols. This paper offers a complementary perspective: a student-led field experiment embedded as a midterm project in UNIV 182 (AI4All) at George Mason University, a Mason Core course designed for undergraduates across disciplines with no expected prior STEM exposure. Student teams designed their own reasoning tasks, ran them on widely used consumer chatbots representative of current capabilities, and evaluated both (i) answer correctness and (ii) the validity of the chatbot's stated reasoning (for example, cases where an answer is correct but the explanation is not, or vice versa). Across eight teams that reported standardized scores, students contributed 80 original reasoning prompts spanning six categories: pattern completion, transformation rules, spatial/visual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, relational/logic reasoning, and analogical reasoning. These prompts yielded 320 model responses plus follow-up explanations. Aggregating team-level results, OpenAI GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 achieved the highest mean answer accuracy (86.2% and 83.8%), followed by Grok 4 (82.5%) and Perplexity (73.1%); explanation validity showed a similar ordering (81.2%, 80.0%, 77.5%, 66.2%). Qualitatively, teams converged on a consistent error signature: strong performance on short, structured math and pattern items but reduced reliability on spatial/visual reasoning and multi-step transformations, with frequent "sound right but reason wrong" explanations. The assignment's primary contribution is pedagogical: it operationalizes AI literacy as experimental practice (prompt design, measurement, rater disagreement, and interpretability/grounding) while producing a reusable, student-generated corpus of reasoning probes grounded in authentic end-user interaction.

Motivation: 智能语音助手隐私控制不透明且难管理，研究其隐私风险、收益与算法透明度、信任及隐私自我效能对隐私保护行为的影响。

Method: 通过对26名16 - 24岁加拿大青年进行五组半结构化焦点小组访谈来分析。

Result: 政策过载、设置分散等削弱自我效能、阻碍保护行为；简单透明度提示可提升信心。构建模型揭示透明度摩擦、自我效能和隐私保护行为的关系。

Conclusion: 基于模型给出统一隐私中心、数据“营养”标签等设计指导，助力智能语音助手治理与设计，保障青年数字公民权益和便利。

Abstract: Smart voice assistants (SVAs) are embedded in the daily lives of youth, yet their privacy controls often remain opaque and difficult to manage. Through five semi-structured focus groups (N=26) with young Canadians (ages 16-24), we investigate how perceived privacy risks (PPR) and benefits (PPBf) intersect with algorithmic transparency and trust (ATT) and privacy self-efficacy (PSE) to shape privacy-protective behaviors (PPB). Our analysis reveals that policy overload, fragmented settings, and unclear data retention undermine self-efficacy and discourage protective actions. Conversely, simple transparency cues were associated with greater confidence without diminishing the utility of hands-free tasks and entertainment. We synthesize these findings into a qualitative model in which transparency friction erodes PSE, which in turn weakens PPB. From this model, we derive actionable design guidance for SVAs, including a unified privacy hub, plain-language "data nutrition" labels, clear retention defaults, and device-conditional micro-tutorials. This work foregrounds youth perspectives and offers a path for SVA governance and design that empowers young digital citizens while preserving convenience.

Motivation: AI 智能设备的始终监听设计和复杂数据管理过程引发隐私与透明度担忧，需评估其是否符合隐私设计原则和支持用户有效控制。

Method: 采用启发式评估、PIPEDA 合规评估和以青少年为中心的可用性测试的综合框架。

Result: Google Home 可用性得分最高，Siri 监管合规性得分最高，Alexa 任务导航清晰但数据保留透明度低，青少年隐私自我效能受技术设计等限制。

Conclusion: 增强透明度、插入隐私引导和改进政策一致性是确保智能设备可用性和符合隐私标准的关键步骤。

Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy and usability of AI-enabled smart devices commonly used by youth, focusing on Google Home Mini, Amazon Alexa, and Apple Siri. While these devices provide convenience and efficiency, they also raise privacy and transparency concerns due to their always-listening design and complex data management processes. The study proposes and applies a combined framework of Heuristic Evaluation, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance Assessment, and Youth-Centered Usability Testing to assess whether these devices align with Privacy-by-Design principles and support meaningful user control. Results show that Google Home achieved the highest usability score, while Siri scored highest in regulatory compliance, indicating a trade-off between user convenience and privacy protection. Alexa demonstrated clearer task navigation but weaker transparency in data retention. Findings suggest that although youth may feel capable of managing their data, their privacy self-efficacy remains limited by technical design, complex settings, and unclear data policies. The paper concludes that enhancing transparency, embedding privacy guidance during onboarding, and improving policy alignment are critical steps toward ensuring that smart devices are both usable and compliant with privacy standards that protect young users.

Conclusion: 文中未明确全面结论，但指出了社会学领域在期刊出版方面仍存在的一些偏见现象。

Abstract: There is a science of science and an informal economics of economics, but there is not a cohesive sociology of sociology. We turn the central findings and theoretical lenses of the sociological tradition and the sociological study of stratification inward on sociology itself to investigate how sociology has changed since the 1970s. We link two bibliometric databases to trace diachronic relationships between PhD training and publication outcomes, both of which are understudied in the science of science and sociology of science. All of sociology's top 3 journals remained biased against alum of less prestigious PhD programs, and while most forms of bias in elite sociological publishing have ameliorated over time, the house bias of the American Journal of Sociology in favor PhD alumnae of UChicago has intensified.

Conclusion: 所提出框架能将多样临床常规 MRI 数据稳健转化为定量图，为大规模定量生物标志物研究铺平道路。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of clinical neuroimaging, yet conventional MRIs provide qualitative information heavily dependent on scanner hardware and acquisition settings. While quantitative MRI (qMRI) offers intrinsic tissue parameters, the requirement for specialized acquisition protocols and reconstruction algorithms restricts its availability and impedes large-scale biomarker research. This study presents a self-supervised physics-guided deep learning framework to infer quantitative T1, T2, and proton-density (PD) maps directly from widely available clinical conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR MRIs. The framework was trained and evaluated on a large-scale, clinically heterogeneous dataset comprising 4,121 scan sessions acquired at our institution over six years on four different 3 T MRI scanner systems, capturing real-world clinical variability. The framework integrates Bloch-based signal models directly into the training objective. Across more than 600 test sessions, the generated maps exhibited white matter and gray matter values consistent with literature ranges. Additionally, the generated maps showed invariance to scanner hardware and acquisition protocol groups, with inter-group coefficients of variation $\leq$ 1.1%. Subject-specific analyses demonstrated excellent voxel-wise reproducibility across scanner systems and sequence parameters, with Pearson $r$ and concordance correlation coefficients exceeding 0.82 for T1 and T2. Mean relative voxel-wise differences were low across all quantitative parameters, especially for T2 ($<$ 6%). These results indicate that the proposed framework can robustly transform diverse clinical conventional MRI data into quantitative maps, potentially paving the way for large-scale quantitative biomarker research.

Conclusion: 照明角谱是控制衍射网络的强大自由度，为多任务全光计算提供可扩展且通用的框架。

Abstract: Diffractive neural networks have recently emerged as a promising framework for all-optical computing. However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths. Our results establish the illumination angular spectrum as a powerful degree of freedom for controlling diffractive networks, enabling a scalable and versatile framework for multi-task all-optical computing.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed visual data analysis, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) becoming highly effective in learning meaningful feature representations directly from images. Unlike traditional manual feature engineering methods, CNNs automatically extract hierarchical visual patterns, enabling strong performance across diverse real-world contexts. This study investigates the effectiveness of CNN-based architectures across five heterogeneous datasets spanning agricultural and urban domains: mango variety classification, paddy variety identification, road surface condition assessment, auto-rickshaw detection, and footpath encroachment monitoring. These datasets introduce varying challenges, including differences in illumination, resolution, environmental complexity, and class imbalance, necessitating adaptable and robust learning models.
  We evaluate a lightweight, task-specific custom CNN alongside established deep architectures, including ResNet-18 and VGG-16, trained both from scratch and using transfer learning. Through systematic preprocessing, augmentation, and controlled experimentation, we analyze how architectural complexity, model depth, and pre-training influence convergence, generalization, and performance across datasets of differing scale and difficulty. The key contributions of this work are: (1) the development of an efficient custom CNN that achieves competitive performance across multiple application domains, and (2) a comprehensive comparative analysis highlighting when transfer learning and deep architectures provide substantial advantages, particularly in data-constrained environments. These findings offer practical insights for deploying deep learning models in resource-limited yet high-impact real-world visual classification tasks.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of custom-built Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) against popular pre-trained architectures (ResNet-18 and VGG-16) using both feature extraction and transfer learning approaches. We evaluated these models across five diverse image classification datasets from Bangladesh: Footpath Vision, Auto Rickshaw Detection, Mango Image Classification, Paddy Variety Recognition, and Road Damage Detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning with fine-tuning consistently outperforms both custom CNNs built from scratch and feature extraction methods, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 3% to 76% across different datasets. Notably, ResNet-18 with fine-tuning achieved perfect 100% accuracy on the Road Damage BD dataset. While custom CNNs offer advantages in model size (3.4M parameters vs. 11-134M for pre-trained models) and training efficiency on simpler tasks, pre-trained models with transfer learning provide superior performance, particularly on complex classification tasks with limited training data. This research provides practical insights for practitioners in selecting appropriate deep learning approaches based on dataset characteristics, computational resources, and performance requirements.

Result: 实验证明MCLC在不同图像恢复任务中有效，且与现有求解器兼容。

Conclusion: MCLC是迈向更强大零样本逆问题求解器的关键一步。

Abstract: With recent advances in generative models, diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems in each domain. Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes. We highlight that MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, yet most evaluations focus on short videos and assume unconstrained computational resources. In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new "A+B" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.

Conclusion: 基于置信度的方向选择对模型树集成既有前景也有局限。

Abstract: We study rotation-robust learning for image inputs using Convolutional Model Trees (CMTs) [1], whose split and leaf coefficients can be structured on the image grid and transformed geometrically at deployment time. In a controlled MNIST setting with a rotation-invariant regression target, we introduce three geometry-aware inductive biases for split directions -- convolutional smoothing, a tilt dominance constraint, and importance-based pruning -- and quantify their impact on robustness under in-plane rotations. We further evaluate a deployment-time orientation search that selects a discrete rotation maximizing a forest-level confidence proxy without updating model parameters. Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can be harmful near the canonical orientation when confidence is misaligned with correctness. Finally, we observe consistent trends on MNIST digit recognition implemented as one-vs-rest regression, highlighting both the promise and limitations of confidence-based orientation selection for model-tree ensembles.

Conclusion: 对两种模态进行奖励加权和策略性设计后训练数据是有效的。

Abstract: Unified multimodal generation architectures that jointly produce text and images have recently emerged as a promising direction for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, many existing systems rely on explicit modality switching, generating reasoning text before switching manually to image generation. This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data.

Result: 在相关数据集上实现3 - 4倍提速、4倍成本降低，剪辑质量有竞争力，且连贯和信息性得分优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在生命科学领域视频摘要提取中有潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are poised to revolutionize the digital transformation of pharmacyceutical industry by enabling intelligent, scalable, and automated multi-modality content processing. Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars).
  Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.

Abstract: Foundation models for vision are predominantly trained on RGB data, while many safety-critical applications rely on non-visible modalities such as infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities.

Abstract: Cochlear Implant (CI) surgery treats severe hearing loss by inserting an electrode array into the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve. An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans. To our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy shape prediction, offering a robust and efficient solution for CI surgical planning while leveraging 3D T-distribution loss in weakly-supervised medical imaging.

Conclusion: 该系统能为预算有限的实验室带来开展实验的机会。

Abstract: When researchers deploy large language models for autonomous tasks like reviewing literature or generating hypotheses, the computational bills add up quickly. A single research session using a 70-billion parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud fees, putting these tools out of reach for many academic labs. We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate. For labs watching their budgets, this could mean the difference between running experiments and sitting on the sidelines

Result: 所提方法在广泛的设置中始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CRUNet - MR - Univ模型具有有效性和应用前景。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has attracted increasing attention in the field of Cardiac MRI (CMR) reconstruction due to its superior performance over traditional methods, particularly in handling higher acceleration factors, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications. However, current deep learning methods remain limited in generalizability. CMR scans exhibit wide variability in image contrast, sampling patterns, scanner vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types. Most existing models are designed to handle only a single or narrow subset of these variations, leading to performance degradation when faced with distribution shifts. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse CMR scenarios. To this end, we propose CRUNet-MR-Univ, a foundation model that leverages spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to effectively handle the full diversity of CMR scans. Our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across a wide range of settings, highlighting its effectiveness and promise.

Conclusion: 交互式、基于LLM的遥感图像变化解释系统可提高森林变化分析的可访问性、可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Modern forest monitoring workflows increasingly benefit from the growing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery and advances in deep learning. Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning. These results highlight the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and efficiency of forest change analysis.

Result: 在两个公开数据集和一个私有数据集上取得SOTA结果。

Conclusion: HUR - MACL模型有效解决现有头颈器官分割问题，提升分割精度。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs at risk in the head and neck is essential for radiation therapy, yet deep learning models often fail on small, complexly shaped organs. While hybrid architectures that combine different models show promise, they typically just concatenate features without exploiting the unique strengths of each component. This results in functional overlap and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a high uncertainty region-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning (HUR-MACL) model for multi-organ segmentation in the head and neck. This model adaptively identifies high uncertainty regions using a convolutional neural network, and for these regions, Vision Mamba as well as Deformable CNN are utilized to jointly improve their segmentation accuracy. Additionally, a heterogeneous feature distillation loss was proposed to promote collaborative learning between the two architectures in high uncertainty regions to further enhance performance. Our method achieves SOTA results on two public datasets and one private dataset.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in single-image grounding and general multi-image understanding. Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW. Furthermore, our model retains strong capabilities in general multi-image understanding.

Conclusion: 所提方法可有效改善视频语言模型的幻觉问题，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Video-language models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal understanding but remain prone to hallucinations, especially when reasoning about actions and temporal order. Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法是Pix2Pix在医学图像翻译中的有效扩展。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed tissue information, but its clinical application is limited by long acquisition time, high cost, and restricted resolution. Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability. These results suggest an effective extension of Pix2Pix for medical image translation.

Motivation: 现有自动评估指标在评估文本到图像模型时，不确定是否优先考虑语义正确性还是倾向于原型图像，因此识别和研究原型偏差。

Method: 引入对照基准测试 ProtoBias，将语义正确但非原型的图像与细微错误但原型的对抗图像配对，以此评估指标表现。

Conclusion: 提出的 ProtoScore 指标大幅降低错误率，减少误排名，运行速度比 GPT - 5 快，接近大型闭源裁判的稳健性。

Abstract: Automatic metrics are now central to evaluating text-to-image models, often substituting for human judgment in benchmarking and large-scale filtering. However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study \emph{prototypicality bias} as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \textsc{\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\textit{\textbf{Proto}typical \textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.

Conclusion: 纯变压器架构结合目标令牌压缩足以实现准确、高效和自适应的端到端驾驶。

Abstract: We present DrivoR, a simple and efficient transformer-based architecture for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our approach builds on pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) and introduces camera-aware register tokens that compress multi-camera features into a compact scene representation, significantly reducing downstream computation without sacrificing accuracy. These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark. Our results show that a pure-transformer architecture, combined with targeted token compression, is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end driving.

Abstract: This work introduces VERSE, a methodology for analyzing and improving Vision-Language Models applied to Visually-rich Document Understanding by exploring their visual embedding space. VERSE enables the visualization of latent representations, supporting the assessment of model feasibility. It also facilitates the identification of problematic regions and guides the generation of synthetic data to enhance performance in those clusters. We validate the methodology by training on the synthetic MERIT Dataset and evaluating on its real-world counterpart, MERIT Secret. Results show that VERSE helps uncover the visual features associated with error-prone clusters, and that retraining with samples containing these features substantially boosts F1 performance without degrading generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that on-premise models such as Donut and Idefics2, when optimized with VERSE, match or even surpass the performance of SaaS solutions like GPT-4 and Pixtral.

Motivation: 物体幻觉严重影响多模态大语言模型可靠性，现有缓解方法有限。

Method: 引入Vision - Language Introspection (VLI)框架，先进行属性内省诊断幻觉风险并定位视觉锚点，再采用可解释双因果引导调节推理过程。

Result: 在先进模型上达到了最先进性能，在MMHal - Bench上物体幻觉率降低12.67%，在POPE上准确率提高5.8%。

Conclusion: VLI能有效减少多模态大语言模型的物体幻觉问题。

Abstract: Object hallucination critically undermines the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models, often stemming from a fundamental failure in cognitive introspection, where models blindly trust linguistic priors over specific visual evidence. Existing mitigations remain limited: contrastive decoding approaches operate superficially without rectifying internal semantic misalignments, while current latent steering methods rely on static vectors that lack instance-specific precision. We introduce Vision-Language Introspection (VLI), a training-free inference framework that simulates a metacognitive self-correction process. VLI first performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize the causal visual anchors. It then employs Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to actively modulate the inference process, dynamically isolating visual evidence from background noise while neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration. VLI achieves state-of-the-art performance on advanced models, reducing object hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improving accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.

Conclusion: 与问题对齐的视图选择和开放视图搜索是一种无需额外训练、模型无关的有效策略，可提升3D具身问答的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments often requires collecting context that is distributed across multiple viewpoints and partially occluded. However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached.
  We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型常因偏向文本提示而产生幻觉，研究其在对象计数场景下这种失效模式。

Method: 在可控对象计数设置中进行研究，对三个大视觉语言模型进行机制分析，消融特定注意力头。

Result: 消融一组注意力头可使提示诱导的幻觉至少减少40%，不同模型的PIH头以特定方式介导提示复制。

Conclusion: 为驱动提示诱导幻觉的内部机制提供见解，揭示不同模型实现这种行为的特定差异。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly capable, yet often hallucinate by favoring textual prompts over visual evidence. We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.

Abstract: The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.

Conclusion: 递归热启动对图染色及组合优化的局部搜索方法有独立研究价值。

Abstract: Node coloring is the task of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, while using as few colors as possible. It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类与AI交互时的情感基调如何塑造ChatGPT和人类的行为。

Method: 进行组间实验，让参与者在与ChatGPT（GPT - 4.0）完成两项任务时表达特定情感。

Result: 表扬使ChatGPT答案提升更大，愤怒有较小提升，责备无提升；处理伦理困境时，愤怒使ChatGPT少关注企业利益，责备使它更重视公众利益；责备后人际交流更多负面表达。

Conclusion: 人机交互中的情感基调不仅影响ChatGPT输出，还会延续到后续人际交流。

Abstract: This research examines how the emotional tone of human-AI interactions shapes ChatGPT and human behavior. In a between-subject experiment, we asked participants to express a specific emotion while working with ChatGPT (GPT-4.0) on two tasks, including writing a public response and addressing an ethical dilemma. We found that compared to interactions where participants maintained a neutral tone, ChatGPT showed greater improvement in its answers when participants praised ChatGPT for its responses. Expressing anger towards ChatGPT also led to a higher albeit smaller improvement relative to the neutral condition, whereas blaming ChatGPT did not improve its answers. When addressing an ethical dilemma, ChatGPT prioritized corporate interests less when participants expressed anger towards it, while blaming increases its emphasis on protecting the public interest. Additionally, we found that people used more negative, hostile, and disappointing expressions in human-human communication after interactions during which participants blamed rather than praised for their responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that the emotional tone people apply in human-AI interactions not only shape ChatGPT's outputs but also carry over into subsequent human-human communication.

Motivation: 前端开发中视觉元素对传达设计意图重要，但在多轮代码生成中的作用未充分研究，需填补该空白。

Method: 整理包含100个多轮对话的FronTalk数据集，提出基于代理的评估框架，用AceCoder方法解决遗忘问题。

Result: 评估20个模型发现模型存在覆盖先前功能的遗忘问题和解读视觉反馈的难题；AceCoder使遗忘率接近零，性能提升9.3%。

Conclusion: 为前端开发和多轮多模态代码生成交互动力学的未来研究提供坚实基础。

Abstract: We present FronTalk, a benchmark for front-end code generation that pioneers the study of a unique interaction dynamic: conversational code generation with multi-modal feedback. In front-end development, visual artifacts such as sketches, mockups and annotated creenshots are essential for conveying design intent, yet their role in multi-turn code generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the front-end development task and curate FronTalk, a collection of 100 multi-turn dialogues derived from real-world websites across diverse domains such as news, finance, and art. Each turn features both a textual instruction and an equivalent visual instruction, each representing the same user intent. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we propose a novel agent-based evaluation framework leveraging a web agent to simulate users and explore the website, and thus measuring both functional correctness and user experience. Evaluation of 20 models reveals two key challenges that are under-explored systematically in the literature: (1) a significant forgetting issue where models overwrite previously implemented features, resulting in task failures, and (2) a persistent challenge in interpreting visual feedback, especially for open-source vision-language models (VLMs). We propose a strong baseline to tackle the forgetting issue with AceCoder, a method that critiques the implementation of every past instruction using an autonomous web agent. This approach significantly reduces forgetting to nearly zero and improves the performance by up to 9.3% (56.0% to 65.3%). Overall, we aim to provide a solid foundation for future research in front-end development and the general interaction dynamics of multi-turn, multi-modal code generation.

Conclusion: 展示了RAGVUE完整工作流程，说明可集成到研究和实际RAG开发中，代码和使用说明已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remains a challenging task: existing metrics often collapse heterogeneous behaviors into single scores and provide little insight into whether errors arise from retrieval,reasoning, or grounding. In this paper, we introduce RAGVUE, a diagnostic and explainable framework for automated, reference-free evaluation of RAG pipelines. RAGVUE decomposes RAG behavior into retrieval quality, answer relevance and completeness, strict claim-level faithfulness, and judge calibration. Each metric includes a structured explanation, making the evaluation process transparent. Our framework supports both manual metric selection and fully automated agentic evaluation. It also provides a Python API, CLI, and a local Streamlit interface for interactive usage. In comparative experiments, RAGVUE surfaces fine-grained failures that existing tools such as RAGAS often overlook. We showcase the full RAGVUE workflow and illustrate how it can be integrated into research pipelines and practical RAG development. The source code and detailed instructions on usage are publicly available on GitHub

Result: 确定了收益递减的“肘部点”，给出了这些语言最优词汇量的经验性建议。

Conclusion: 研究提供了实用指导，定量展示了标准BPE对高度黏着语的局限性，SampoNLP库和生成资源公开。

Abstract: The quality of subword tokenization is critical for Large Language Models, yet evaluating tokenizers for morphologically rich Uralic languages is hampered by the lack of clean morpheme lexicons.
  We introduce SampoNLP, a corpus-free toolkit for morphological lexicon creation using MDL-inspired Self-Referential Atomicity Scoring, which filters composite forms through internal structural cues - suited for low-resource settings.
  Using the high-purity lexicons generated by SampoNLP for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers across a range of vocabulary sizes (8k-256k). We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the "elbow points" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages. The SampoNLP library and all generated resources are made publicly available: https://github.com/AragonerUA/SampoNLP

TL;DR: 提出 LANGSAE EDITING 方法去除多语言嵌入中的语言身份信号，提升多语言密集检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言密集检索中，多语言嵌入包含语言身份信号会影响检索效果，需去除该信号。

Method: 提出后处理稀疏自动编码器 LANGSAE EDITING，通过跨语言激活统计识别语言相关潜在单元，在推理时抑制这些单元并重构嵌入。

Result: 多语言实验显示，该方法提升了排序质量和跨语言覆盖范围，对文字体系不同的语言效果更佳。

Conclusion: LANGSAE EDITING 方法能有效去除语言身份信号，提升多语言密集检索性能。

Abstract: Dense retrieval in multilingual settings often searches over mixed-language collections, yet multilingual embeddings encode language identity alongside semantics. This language signal can inflate similarity for same-language pairs and crowd out relevant evidence written in other languages. We propose LANGSAE EDITING, a post-hoc sparse autoencoder trained on pooled embeddings that enables controllable removal of language-identity signal directly in vector space. The method identifies language-associated latent units using cross-language activation statistics, suppresses these units at inference time, and reconstructs embeddings in the original dimensionality, making it compatible with existing vector databases without retraining the base encoder or re-encoding raw text. Experiments across multiple languages show consistent improvements in ranking quality and cross-language coverage, with especially strong gains for script-distinct languages.

TL;DR: 研究指出大语言模型在电信标准尤其是3GPP规范表现不佳，原因是对表格知识和解读能力不足，为此引入TeleTables基准评估，评估显示小模型表现差，大模型推理能力强，强调需领域微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在电信标准上表现不佳，尤其是对表格知识和解读能力未被深入研究，需要评估工具。

Method: 通过多阶段数据生成管道构建TeleTables基准，从3GPP标准提取表格，用多模态和推理导向大语言模型生成和验证问题。

Result: 小模型在回忆3GPP知识和解读表格方面困难，大模型在表格解读上有更强推理能力。

Conclusion: TeleTables表明需要进行领域专门微调以可靠解读和推理电信标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in the telecom industry to support engineering tasks, accelerate troubleshooting, and assist in interpreting complex technical documents. However, recent studies show that LLMs perform poorly on telecom standards, particularly 3GPP specifications. We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material. Larger models, on the other hand, show stronger reasoning on table interpretation. Overall, TeleTables highlights the need for domain-specialized fine-tuning to reliably interpret and reason over telecom standards.

TL;DR: 提出BiForget框架来合成高质量忘记集，在LLM去学习评估中展现出优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准常不能准确代表模型学到的真正‘遗忘范围’。

Method: 形式化两种去学习粒度，提出BiForget框架，利用目标模型本身，通过种子引导和对抗提示来引出匹配其内部知识分布的数据。

Result: 在不同基准测试中，BiForget在相关性、多样性和效率上取得更好平衡，如在《哈利·波特》领域，相关性提升约20，多样性提升约0.05，数据量减半。

Conclusion: BiForget有助于更稳健的遗忘和更好的效用保留，为评估LLM去学习提供更严格的基础。

Abstract: Although machine unlearning is essential for removing private, harmful, or copyrighted content from LLMs, current benchmarks often fail to faithfully represent the true "forgetting scope" learned by the model. We formalize two distinct unlearning granularities, domain-level and instance-level, and propose BiForget, an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality forget sets. Unlike prior work relying on external generators, BiForget exploits the target model per se to elicit data that matches its internal knowledge distribution through seed-guided and adversarial prompting. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks show that it achieves a superior balance of relevance, diversity, and efficiency. Quantitatively, in the Harry Potter domain, it improves relevance by ${\sim}20$ and diversity by ${\sim}$0.05 while halving the total data size compared to SOTAs. Ultimately, it facilitates more robust forgetting and better utility preservation, providing a more rigorous foundation for evaluating LLM unlearning.

Motivation: 现有RAG策略对检索段落的处理缺乏结构，限制了模型捕捉结构线索和整合知识的能力。

Method: 提出Disco - RAG框架，构建块内话语树捕捉局部层次结构，构建块间修辞图建模跨段落连贯性，并整合到生成规划蓝图中。

Result: 在问答和长文档摘要基准测试中，Disco - RAG无需微调即达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 话语结构在推动RAG系统发展中起着重要作用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an important means of enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.

Motivation: 探索一种能引导冻结大语言模型行为的有效方法。

Method: 在预训练大语言模型中添加新的特殊令牌，仅学习其嵌入，用标准语言建模目标优化嵌入，保持大语言模型冻结。

Result: 在三种评估场景中呈现出特定的方向效应，相比提供完整定义语料，Concept Tokens能更好保留对其他指令的遵循，还通过定性研究展示了学习嵌入捕获的信息和局限性。

Conclusion: Concept Tokens能为冻结的大语言模型提供紧凑控制信号来引导行为。

Abstract: We propose Concept Tokens, a lightweight method that adds a new special token to a pretrained LLM and learns only its embedding from multiple natural language definitions of a target concept, where occurrences of the concept are replaced by the new token. The LLM is kept frozen and the embedding is optimized with the standard language-modeling objective. We evaluate Concept Tokens in three settings. First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions). Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional "Austral Tower" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge. Overall, Concept Tokens provide a compact control signal learned from definitions that can steer behavior in frozen LLMs.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型集成到全球关键基础设施中，安全对齐能否从英语零样本迁移到其他语言存在隐患。

Method: 使用基于西非威胁场景的HausaSafety数据集，采用2x4析因设计对三个模型进行1440次评估，测试语言和时间框架的非线性交互。

Result: 挑战多语言安全差距说法，发现复杂干扰机制；模型存在时间不对称性；一种模型在豪萨语中更安全，但模型在时间推理上有灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 当前模型依赖表层启发式，缺乏语义理解，使全球南方用户暴露风险，提议不变对齐范式确保安全稳定。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

Abstract: We present MedPI, a high-dimensional benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in patient-clinician conversations. Unlike single-turn question-answer (QA) benchmarks, MedPI evaluates the medical dialogue across 105 dimensions comprising the medical process, treatment safety, treatment outcomes and doctor-patient communication across a granular, accreditation-aligned rubric. MedPI comprises five layers: (1) Patient Packets (synthetic EHR-like ground truth); (2) an AI Patient instantiated through an LLM with memory and affect; (3) a Task Matrix spanning encounter reasons (e.g. anxiety, pregnancy, wellness checkup) x encounter objectives (e.g. diagnosis, lifestyle advice, medication advice); (4) an Evaluation Framework with 105 dimensions on a 1-4 scale mapped to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies; and (5) AI Judges that are calibrated, committee-based LLMs providing scores, flags, and evidence-linked rationales. We evaluate 9 flagship models -- Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, MedGemma, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3.3 70b Instruct, GPT-5, GPT OSS 120b, o3, Grok-4 -- across 366 AI Patients and 7,097 conversations using a standardized "vanilla clinician" prompt. For all LLMs, we observe low performance across a variety of dimensions, in particular on differential diagnosis. Our work can help guide future use of LLMs for diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

Abstract: Product information extraction is crucial for e-commerce services, but obtaining high-quality labeled datasets remains challenging. We present a systematic approach for generating synthetic e-commerce product data using Large Language Models (LLMs), introducing a controlled modification framework with three strategies: attribute-preserving modification, controlled negative example generation, and systematic attribute removal. Using a state-of-the-art LLM with attribute-aware prompts, we enforce store constraints while maintaining product coherence. Human evaluation of 2000 synthetic products demonstrates high effectiveness, with 99.6% rated as natural, 96.5% containing valid attribute values, and over 90% showing consistent attribute usage. On the public MAVE dataset, our synthetic data achieves 60.5% accuracy, performing on par with real training data (60.8%) and significantly improving upon the 13.4% zero-shot baseline. Hybrid configurations combining synthetic and real data further improve performance, reaching 68.8% accuracy. Our framework provides a practical solution for augmenting e-commerce datasets, particularly valuable for low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型问答系统在社区特定查询上的‘知识盲点’问题，避免边缘化本地声音和强化认知不公。

Method: 举办三次参与式制图研讨会，设计引出方法和模式；审计县级基准问答对；进行参与式问答集测试。

Result: 县级基准问答中76.7%的错误是事实差距、文化误解等问题；无额外上下文时，最先进的大语言模型在参与式问答集上正确率低于21%，缺失事实常在收集的叙事中。

Conclusion: 提出的分类法、协议和参与式评估为构建能更好回答本地问题的社区导向AI提供了严谨基础。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) question-answering systems often fail on community-specific queries, creating "knowledge blind spots" that marginalize local voices and reinforce epistemic injustice. We present Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol that transforms community stories into structured narrative units and integrates them into AI systems under community governance. Learning from three participatory mapping workshops with N=24 community members, we designed elicitation methods and a schema that retain narrative richness while enabling entity, time, and place extraction, validation, and provenance control. To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors. On a participatory QA set derived from our workshops, a state-of-the-art LLM answered fewer than 21% of questions correctly without added context, underscoring the need for local grounding. The missing facts often appear in the collected narratives, suggesting a direct path to closing the dominant error modes for narrative items. Beyond the protocol and pilot, we articulate key design tensions, such as representation and power, governance and control, and privacy and consent, providing concrete requirements for retrieval-first, provenance-visible, locally governed QA systems. Together, our taxonomy, protocol, and participatory evaluation offer a rigorous foundation for building community-grounded AI that better answers local questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流扩散语言模型掩码策略用单一全局置信度阈值，忽视了单个token的时空调动态性，导致冗余迭代和并行性受限。

Method: 提出新的掩码方法，动态检测每个token的时间方差和空间偏差，以反映其收敛状态和token间的相关性，自适应调整每个token每一步的置信度阈值。

Result: 在主流数据集上显著提高DLM的操作效率，速度提升达8.9倍，且忠实保留生成质量。

Conclusion: 新的掩码方法能有效提升扩散语言模型的效率和质量。

Abstract: Unlike autoregressive language models, diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text by iteratively denoising all token positions in parallel. At each timestep, the remasking strategy of a DLM selects low-priority tokens to defer their decoding, thereby improving both efficiency and output quality. However, mainstream remasking strategies rely on a single global confidence threshold, overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of individual tokens. Motivated by the redundant iterations and constrained parallelism introduced by fixed-threshold remasking, we propose a novel remasking approach that dynamically detects Temporal Variance and Spatial Deviance of each token, which reflect its convergence status and inter-token correlations. Using these signals, our method adaptively adjusts the confidence threshold for every token at every step. Empirical results show that our approach significantly improves the operational efficiency of DLMs across mainstream datasets, achieving speedups of up to 8.9 times while faithfully preserving generation quality.

Conclusion: 该方法实用且低成本，可使模型与特定用户观点对齐。

Abstract: LLMs internally organize political ideology along low-dimensional structures that are partially, but not fully aligned with human ideological space. This misalignment is systematic, model specific, and measurable. We introduce a lightweight linear probe that both quantifies the misalignment and minimally corrects the output layer. This paper introduces a simple and efficient method for aligning models with specific user opinions. Instead of retraining the model, we calculated a bias score from its internal features and directly adjusted the final output probabilities. This solution is practical and low-cost and preserves the original reasoning power of the model.

Result: 与其他LLM基线相比，LEXMA预测性能显著提升，专家和消费者端解释质量佳。

Conclusion: LEXMA是一种经济高效、系统的LLM微调方法，有助于提升商业决策解释质量，推动透明AI系统可扩展部署。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models increasingly drive high-stakes consumer interactions, yet their decision logic often remains opaque. Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite. Our study contributes a cost-efficient, systematic LLM fine-tuning approach to enhance explanation quality for business decisions, offering strong potential for scalable deployment of transparent AI systems.

Result: 在三个推理模型上评估，CARD在GSM8K上准确率达81.4% - 89.2%，降低token成本1.88x - 2.40x；在MATH - 500上准确率达75.1 - 86.8%，使用token减少1.71x - 5.74x。

Conclusion: 预复杂性估计能提高准确率并显著提升效率。

Abstract: Large language models often fail on multi-step reasoning due to fixed reasoning strategies that ignore problem specific difficulty. We introduce CARD (Complexity Agnostic Recursive Decomposition), a framework that predicts problem complexity before generation and adapts decomposition accordingly. Our system comprises MRCE (Multi-dimensional Reasoning Complexity Estimator), a 0.6B Qwen model predicting 30 fine-grained features from question text and a two-stage recursive solver: (1) hierarchical decomposition into K steps based on task profile and (2) per-step thought budget allocation (1, 5-9, or 10 thoughts) via recursive MRCE profiling. Evaluated on three reasoning models (Qwen3-0.6B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, Qwen3-1.7B), CARD achieves 81.4% to 89.2% accuracy on GSM8K while reducing token cost by 1.88x to 2.40x compared to fixed decomposition baselines. On MATH-500, CARD reaches 75.1 to 86.8% accuracy using 1.71x to 5.74x fewer tokens. Our results demonstrate that preemptive complexity estimation enables both higher accuracy and significant efficiency gains.

Result: 冗余编辑策略能使2跳问题准确率至少提高15.5个百分点，比之前单编辑策略提升96%，但牺牲一定特异性和语言自然度。

Conclusion: 冗余编辑策略可有效提升多跳推理准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Editing (KE), particularly Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), show superior efficiency over fine-tuning and in-context learning for updating single-hop facts in transformers. However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the "hopping-too-late" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of "hopping-too-late" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve accuracy on 2-hop questions by at least 15.5 percentage points, representing a 96% increase over the previous single-edit strategy, while trading off some specificity and language naturalness.

Our work provides insights into the impact of data quality and model size on preference-based optimization, highlighting the conditions under which these methods are most effective.

Conclusion: 所提方法在微调大语言模型中能有效平衡效率和准确性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, but the substantial memory overhead during backpropagation remains a critical bottleneck, especially as model scales grow. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型DeepSeek - V3内层表征中句法和语义信息的编码方式。

Method: 对共享句法结构或语义的句子的隐藏表征向量求平均，得到“质心”向量，再从句子向量中减去这些质心向量。

Result: 得到的向量能捕捉表征中大量句法和语义信息；减去质心向量会影响句子向量相似度；句法和语义跨层编码不同，且可在一定程度上解耦。

Conclusion: 句法和语义信息在大语言模型表征中至少部分线性编码，且两种语言信息编码存在差异。

Abstract: We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.

Conclusion: 这是首个通过连续词元表示收敛后再离散化生成文本的自回归语言模型，无需词元级采样实现稳定生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are conventionally defined over discrete token sequences, committing to a specific token at every generation step. This early discretization forces uncertainty to be resolved through token-level sampling, often leading to instability, repetition, and sensitivity to decoding heuristics.
  In this work, we introduce a continuous autoregressive formulation of language generation in which tokens are represented as continuous vectors that \emph{mature} over multiple update steps before being discretized. Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.
  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.
  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling.

Motivation: 大语言模型面向全球受众，对齐需从强制执行普遍共识转向尊重文化多元，但密集模型在拟合冲突价值分布时会出现均值崩溃问题。

Method: 提出CuMA框架，将对齐视为条件容量分离问题，通过引入人口统计感知路由，内化潜在文化拓扑来分离冲突梯度。

Result: 在WorldValuesBench、Community Alignment和PRISM上的广泛评估表明，CuMA实现了最先进的性能，显著优于密集基线和仅基于语义的混合专家模型。

Conclusion: CuMA有效减轻了均值崩溃问题，保留了文化多样性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) serve a global audience, alignment must transition from enforcing universal consensus to respecting cultural pluralism. We demonstrate that dense models, when forced to fit conflicting value distributions, suffer from \textbf{Mean Collapse}, converging to a generic average that fails to represent diverse groups. We attribute this to \textbf{Cultural Sparsity}, where gradient interference prevents dense parameters from spanning distinct cultural modes. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{\textsc{CuMA}} (\textbf{Cu}ltural \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{A}dapters), a framework that frames alignment as a \textbf{conditional capacity separation} problem. By incorporating demographic-aware routing, \textsc{CuMA} internalizes a \textit{Latent Cultural Topology} to explicitly disentangle conflicting gradients into specialized expert subspaces. Extensive evaluations on WorldValuesBench, Community Alignment, and PRISM demonstrate that \textsc{CuMA} achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both dense baselines and semantic-only MoEs. Crucially, our analysis confirms that \textsc{CuMA} effectively mitigates mean collapse, preserving cultural diversity. Our code is available at https://github.com/Throll/CuMA.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型存在文本偏差问题，现有模型在高语言主导下视觉能力有待提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on standard visual reasoning benchmarks. However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize "lucky" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity. Our evaluation of 12 frontier MLLMs reveals that while models excel in existing benchmarks, they experience significant visual collapse under high linguistic dominance.

Abstract: Deploying LLMs in real-world applications requires controllable output that satisfies multiple desiderata at the same time. While existing work extensively addresses LLM steering for a single behavior, \textit{compositional steering} -- i.e., steering LLMs simultaneously towards multiple behaviors -- remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose \emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging). Moreover, we show that steering tokens complement natural language instructions, with their combination resulting in further gains.

Result: 提供了可用于生产的品牌情感追踪AI解决方案。

Conclusion: 为低资源码混合语言环境下的多语言NLP建立了强大基准。

Abstract: The effectiveness of brand monitoring in India is increasingly challenged by the rise of Hinglish--a hybrid of Hindi and English--used widely in user-generated content on platforms like Twitter. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish. This research delivers a production-ready AI solution for brand sentiment tracking and establishes a strong benchmark for multilingual NLP in low-resource, code-mixed environments.

Conclusion: 当前对齐技术未实现非歧视原则，挑战了现有安全扩展定律，鼓励对细粒度人口统计对齐进行研究。

Abstract: Current safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) create a dangerous illusion of universality, aggregating "Identity Hate" into scalar scores that mask systemic vulnerabilities against specific populations. To expose this selective safety, we introduce MiJaBench, a bilingual (English and Portuguese) adversarial benchmark comprising 44,000 prompts across 16 minority groups. By generating 528,000 prompt-response pairs from 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, we curate MiJaBench-Align, revealing that safety alignment is not a generalized semantic capability but a demographic hierarchy: defense rates fluctuate by up to 33\% within the same model solely based on the target group. Crucially, we demonstrate that model scaling exacerbates these disparities, suggesting that current alignment techniques do not create principle of non-discrimination but reinforces memorized refusal boundaries only for specific groups, challenging the current scaling laws of security. We release all datasets and scripts to encourage research into granular demographic alignment at GitHub.

Result: 在六个基准测试中平均准确率达49.52%，仅为1.07%的生成token调用大语言模型，相比性能匹配的随机路由器成本降低98.2%。

Conclusion: RelayLLM有效平衡计算成本和推理性能，缩小大小模型性能差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively "relaying" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.

Result: 社会和语言因素影响大语言模型表现，简单干预能显著提升其在安全基准测试中的表现，且保持低误报率。

Conclusion: 评估大语言模型行为和提升安全性时考虑语用学很重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to challenge users' harmful beliefs in domains ranging from medical advice to social reasoning. We argue that these failures can be understood and addressed pragmatically as consequences of LLMs defaulting to accommodating users' assumptions and exhibiting insufficient epistemic vigilance. We show that social and linguistic factors known to influence accommodation in humans (at-issueness, linguistic encoding, and source reliability) similarly affect accommodation in LLMs, explaining performance differences across three safety benchmarks that test models' ability to challenge harmful beliefs, spanning misinformation (Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval) and sycophancy (ELEPHANT). We further show that simple pragmatic interventions, such as adding the phrase "wait a minute", significantly improve performance on these benchmarks while preserving low false-positive rates. Our results highlight the importance of considering pragmatics for evaluating LLM behavior and improving LLM safety.

Motivation: 大语言模型依赖大规模数据集易受后门攻击，但指令微调模型的防御方法研究不足。

Method: 提出MB - Defense训练管道，包括防御性投毒（合并攻击和防御触发器）和权重恢复（额外训练打破表示恢复干净行为）两个阶段。

Result: 在多个大语言模型上的实验表明，MB - Defense大幅降低攻击成功率，同时保留指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: MB - Defense是一种可泛化且数据高效的防御策略，提高了指令微调大语言模型对未知后门攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly through instruction tuning, which enables broad task generalization without additional fine-tuning. However, their reliance on large-scale datasets-often collected from human or web sources-makes them vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison a small subset of data to implant hidden behaviors. Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats. MB-Defense comprises two stages: (i) defensive poisoning, which merges attacker and defensive triggers into a unified backdoor representation, and (ii) weight recovery, which breaks this representation through additional training to restore clean behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs show that MB-Defense substantially lowers attack success rates while preserving instruction-following ability. Our method offers a generalizable and data-efficient defense strategy, improving the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs against unseen backdoor attacks.

Abstract: We used machine learning and artificial intelligence: 1) to measure levels of peace in countries from news and social media and 2) to develop on-line tools that promote peace by helping users better understand their own media diet. For news media, we used neural networks to measure levels of peace from text embeddings of on-line news sources. The model, trained on one news media dataset also showed high accuracy when used to analyze a different news dataset. For social media, such as YouTube, we developed other models to measure levels of social dimensions important in peace using word level (GoEmotions) and context level (Large Language Model) methods. To promote peace, we note that 71% of people 20-40 years old daily view most of their news through short videos on social media. Content creators of these videos are biased towards creating videos with emotional activation, making you angry to engage you, to increase clicks. We developed and tested a Chrome extension, MirrorMirror, which provides real-time feedback to YouTube viewers about the peacefulness of the media they are watching. Our long term goal is for MirrorMirror to evolve into an open-source tool for content creators, journalists, researchers, platforms, and individual users to better understand the tone of their media creation and consumption and its effects on viewers. Moving beyond simple engagement metrics, we hope to encourage more respectful, nuanced, and informative communication.

Motivation: 当前直接在多奖励设置下应用GRPO，未考察其适用性，需解决该方法存在的导致训练信号分辨率降低、收敛不佳等问题。

Method: 提出组奖励解耦归一化策略优化（GDPO）方法，解耦单个奖励的归一化。

Result: 在工具调用、数学推理和代码推理三个任务中，GDPO在正确性和约束遵守指标上均始终优于GRPO。

Conclusion: GDPO对多奖励强化学习优化有效且具有通用性。

Abstract: As language models become increasingly capable, users expect them to provide not only accurate responses but also behaviors aligned with diverse human preferences across a variety of scenarios. To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization.

Motivation: 大多数研究忽略了初始内存提取阶段，现有基于摘要的方法存在“提前总结”和“一次性提取”两个主要局限。

Method: 提出主动内存提取（ProMem），将提取视为迭代认知过程，引入循环反馈机制，让代理通过自我提问主动探查对话历史。

Result: ProMem显著提高了提取内存的完整性和QA准确率，在提取质量和token成本间取得了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: ProMem能有效解决现有内存提取方法的问题。

Abstract: Memory management is vital for LLM agents to handle long-term interaction and personalization. Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is "ahead-of-time", acting as a blind "feed-forward" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually "one-off", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost.

Result: 模型超越开源音频语言模型和商业API，并保持ASR质量。

Conclusion: WESR将为建模真实听觉场景的未来研究提供基础资源。

Abstract: Speech conveys not only linguistic information but also rich non-verbal vocal events such as laughing and crying. While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Current methods suffer from insufficient task definitions with limited category coverage and ambiguous temporal granularity. They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality. We anticipate that WESR will serve as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich, real-world auditory scenes.

Conclusion: 分层水印策略是一种实用、无需训练的低资源语言水印解决方案，量化了多语言水印鲁棒性与质量的权衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for text generation, watermarking has become essential for authorship attribution, intellectual property protection, and misuse detection. While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\times$ to 4$\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation. Our findings quantify the robustness-quality trade-off in multilingual watermarking and establish layered watermarking as a practical, training-free solution for low-resource languages such as Bangla. Our code and data will be made public.

Result: 在不同规模和家族的大语言模型的四个NLP任务中，NeuronLLM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NeuronLLM为大语言模型功能组织提供新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, but the complex mechanisms underlying their large-scale neurons remain opaque, posing significant challenges for understanding and steering LLMs. While recent studies made progress on identifying responsible neurons for certain abilities, these ability-specific methods are infeasible for task-focused scenarios requiring coordinated use of multiple abilities. Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.

We introduce CuCu, an automated multi-agent LLM framework that transforms national textbook curricula into open-ended, culture-specific question-answer pairs. Applying CuCu to the Korean national social studies curriculum, we construct KCaQA, comprising 34.1k open-ended QA pairs. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that KCaQA covers culture-specific topics and produces responses grounded in local sociocultural contexts.

Result: 模型在多数评估设置中，有效性和鲁棒性均优于所有基线。

Conclusion: SpeechMedAssist能有效进行语音多轮交互，降低对医疗语音数据的要求。

Abstract: Medical consultations are intrinsically speech-centric. However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across languages, yet how language capabilities are organized at the neuron level remains poorly understood. Prior work has identified language-related neurons mainly through activation-based heuristics, which conflate language preference with functional importance. Prior work has identified language-related neurons mainly through activation-based heuristics, which conflate language preference with functional importance. We propose CRANE, a relevance-based analysis framework that redefines language specificity in terms of functional necessity, identifying language-specific neurons through targeted neuron-level interventions. CRANE characterizes neuron specialization by their contribution to language-conditioned predictions rather than activation magnitude. Our implementation will be made publicly available. Neuron-level interventions reveal a consistent asymmetric pattern: masking neurons relevant to a target language selectively degrades performance on that language while preserving performance on other languages to a substantial extent, indicating language-selective but non-exclusive neuron specializations. Experiments on English, Chinese, and Vietnamese across multiple benchmarks, together with a dedicated relevance-based metric and base-to-chat model transfer analysis, show that CRANE isolates language-specific components more precisely than activation-based methods.

Conclusion: 为构建更可信、易调试的集成语言模型与外部工具的AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with external tools have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.

Conclusion: 本研究为越南语AI系统可靠性研究奠定基础，幻觉检测仍是难题，尤其是内在幻觉检测。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) in production environments remains significantly constrained by their propensity to generate hallucinations -- fluent, plausible-sounding outputs that contradict or fabricate information. While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types -- factual, noisy, and adversarial -- to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark and explores a diverse range of detection methodologies, providing a foundation for future research into the trustworthiness and reliability of Vietnamese language AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in specialized domains such as finance and healthcare, where they introduce unique safety risks. Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.

Abstract: The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO adjudicates thousands of ex parte appeals each year, requiring the integration of technical understanding and legal reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies. Notably, on the Issue Type task, closed-source models consistently exceed 0.75 in Micro-F1 score, whereas the strongest open-source model (Qwen-8B) achieves performance around 0.56, highlighting a substantial gap in reasoning capabilities. PILOT-Bench establishes a foundation for the systematic evaluation of patent-domain legal reasoning and points toward future directions for improving LLMs through dataset design and model alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动凸化低效和过度依赖专家知识的问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型的数学推理能力，集成符号推理、自适应变换技术和迭代验证，有纠错和可行域修正机制。

Result: 对100个非凸问题的实验中，NC2C执行率达89.3%，成功产生高质量凸变换的比例为76%，远超基线方法。

Conclusion: NC2C能利用大语言模型实现自动非凸到凸的变换，减少对专家的依赖，使凸求解器能高效处理先前难解决的优化任务。

Abstract: Non-convex optimization problems are pervasive across mathematical programming, engineering design, and scientific computing, often posing intractable challenges for traditional solvers due to their complex objective functions and constrained landscapes. To address the inefficiency of manual convexification and the over-reliance on expert knowledge, we propose NC2C, an LLM-based end-to-end automated framework designed to transform generic non-convex optimization problems into solvable convex forms using large language models. NC2C leverages LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities to autonomously detect non-convex components, select optimal convexification strategies, and generate rigorous convex equivalents. The framework integrates symbolic reasoning, adaptive transformation techniques, and iterative validation, equipped with error correction loops and feasibility domain correction mechanisms to ensure the robustness and validity of transformed problems. Experimental results on a diverse dataset of 100 generic non-convex problems demonstrate that NC2C achieves an 89.3\% execution rate and a 76\% success rate in producing feasible, high-quality convex transformations. This outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin, highlighting NC2C's ability to leverage LLMs for automated non-convex to convex transformation, reduce expert dependency, and enable efficient deployment of convex solvers for previously intractable optimization tasks.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析多智能体自由形式评估中基于角色的权威偏差，发现专家和参照权力角色影响更强，权威偏差源于权威角色坚守立场，且需明确立场陈述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统利用大语言模型常分配权威角色提升性能，但权威偏差对智能体交互的影响研究不足。

Method: 运用French和Raven基于权力的理论，将权威角色分为合法、参照和专家类型，通过ChatEval在12轮对话中分析其影响，使用GPT - 4o和DeepSeek R1进行实验。

Result: 专家和参照权力角色比合法权力角色影响力更强；权威偏差并非源于普通智能体主动顺从，而是权威角色坚守立场，普通智能体表现出灵活性；权威影响需要明确立场陈述，中立回应不会产生偏差。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计具有非对称交互模式的多智能体框架提供关键见解。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models often assign authoritative roles to improve performance, yet the impact of authority bias on agent interactions remains underexplored. We present the first systematic analysis of role-based authority bias in free-form multi-agent evaluation using ChatEval. Applying French and Raven's power-based theory, we classify authoritative roles into legitimate, referent, and expert types and analyze their influence across 12-turn conversations. Experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 reveal that Expert and Referent power roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate power roles. Crucially, authority bias emerges not through active conformity by general agents, but through authoritative roles consistently maintaining their positions while general agents demonstrate flexibility. Furthermore, authority influence requires clear position statements, as neutral responses fail to generate bias. These findings provide key insights for designing multi-agent frameworks with asymmetric interaction patterns.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型个性化问题，提出用自然语言表示偏好，引入两阶段训练框架开发AlignXplore+模型，在九个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前工作中用户偏好表示为不透明黑盒、难以解释和跨模型任务迁移的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架，结合高质量合成数据的监督微调与强化学习。

Result: 8B的AlignXplore+模型在九个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，优于更大的开源模型，且在任务、模型家族和交互格式上具有强迁移性。

Conclusion: 自然语言作为偏好表示接口可行，两阶段训练框架有效。

Abstract: We study the problem of personalization in large language models (LLMs). Prior work predominantly represents user preferences as implicit, model-specific vectors or parameters, yielding opaque ``black-box'' profiles that are difficult to interpret and transfer across models and tasks. In contrast, we advocate natural language as a universal, model- and task-agnostic interface for preference representation. The formulation leads to interpretable and reusable preference descriptions, while naturally supporting continual evolution as new interactions are observed. To learn such representations, we introduce a two-stage training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning on high-quality synthesized data with reinforcement learning to optimize long-term utility and cross-task transferability. Based on this framework, we develop AlignXplore+, a universal preference reasoning model that generates textual preference summaries. Experiments on nine benchmarks show that our 8B model achieves state-of-the-art performanc -- outperforming substantially larger open-source models -- while exhibiting strong transferability across tasks, model families, and interaction formats.

Motivation: 探究推理蒸馏范式能否传递大型推理模型与人类认知成本的自然对齐结构。

Method: 对14个模型测试“邯郸学步”假设，对比教师模型和蒸馏学生模型与人类难度缩放的相关性。

Result: 蒸馏导致功能对齐崩溃，学生模型与人类难度缩放的相关性显著降低，常出现负迁移。

Conclusion: 监督微调产生“货物崇拜”效应，推理蒸馏使计算成本与认知需求解耦，类人认知是主动强化而非被动模仿的涌现属性。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models trained via reinforcement learning exhibit a "natural" alignment with human cognitive costs. However, we show that the prevailing paradigm of reasoning distillation -- training student models to mimic these traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) -- fails to transmit this cognitive structure. Testing the "Hán Dān Xué Bù" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a "Functional Alignment Collapse": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines ("Negative Transfer"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a "Cargo Cult" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation.

TL;DR: 文章提出ArcAligner模块解决检索增强生成中长文档压缩后模型理解难问题，该模块在知识密集型问答基准测试中表现良好，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成中向模型输入长文档会导致模型运行缓慢且成本高，现有上下文压缩方法存在压缩程度与模型理解难度的矛盾。

Method: 提出ArcAligner模块，将其集成到语言模型层，使用自适应“门控”系统，仅在信息复杂时增加额外处理能力。

Result: 在知识密集型问答基准测试中，ArcAligner在可比压缩率下始终优于压缩基线，在多跳和长尾设置中尤其如此。

Conclusion: ArcAligner能帮助模型更好地利用高压缩率的上下文表示进行下游生成，保持系统快速运行。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps LLMs stay accurate, but feeding long documents into a prompt makes the model slow and expensive. This has motivated context compression, ranging from token pruning and summarization to embedding-based compression. While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation. It uses an adaptive ''gating'' system that only adds extra processing power when the information is complex, keeping the system fast. Across knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks, ArcAligner consistently beats compression baselines at comparable compression rates, especially on multi-hop and long-tail settings. The source code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-as-a-Judge在评估复杂对象时可靠性受限，Agent-as-a-Judge兴起但缺乏统一框架，因此作此调查。

Method: 识别范式转变关键维度，建立发展分类法，整理核心方法，调查通用和专业领域应用。

Result: 确定关键维度、分类法，梳理方法和应用领域。

Conclusion: 分析前沿挑战和研究方向，给出下一代智能体评估清晰路线图。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has revolutionized AI evaluation by leveraging large language models for scalable assessments. However, as evaluands become increasingly complex, specialized, and multi-step, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge has become constrained by inherent biases, shallow single-pass reasoning, and the inability to verify assessments against real-world observations. This has catalyzed the transition to Agent-as-a-Judge, where agentic judges employ planning, tool-augmented verification, multi-agent collaboration, and persistent memory to enable more robust, verifiable, and nuanced evaluations. Despite the rapid proliferation of agentic evaluation systems, the field lacks a unified framework to navigate this shifting landscape. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey tracing this evolution. Specifically, we identify key dimensions that characterize this paradigm shift and establish a developmental taxonomy. We organize core methodologies and survey applications across general and professional domains. Furthermore, we analyze frontier challenges and identify promising research directions, ultimately providing a clear roadmap for the next generation of agentic evaluation.

Abstract: We present a rigorous, human-in-the-loop evaluation framework for assessing the performance of AI agents on the task of Air Traffic Control, grounded in a regulator-certified simulator-based curriculum used for training and testing real-world trainee controllers. By leveraging legally regulated assessments and involving expert human instructors in the evaluation process, our framework enables a more authentic and domain-accurate measurement of AI performance. This work addresses a critical gap in the existing literature: the frequent misalignment between academic representations of Air Traffic Control and the complexities of the actual operational environment. It also lays the foundations for effective future human-machine teaming paradigms by aligning machine performance with human assessment targets.

Motivation: 脑机接口在需要快速响应的应用（如驾驶）中有重要作用，开发能让车辆先进驾驶辅助系统即时理解驾驶员意图的方法。

Method: 在驾驶模拟器创造的可控环境中，让参与者在不同驾驶场景（左转、右转、直行）中想象控制车辆，用卷积神经网络(CNN)对检测到的EEG数据进行分类且预处理极少。

Result: 模型区分三种转向意图的准确率达83.7%，对右转片段的分类准确率最高，表明大脑活动可能存在空间偏差。

Conclusion: 本研究为更直观的脑车通信系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.

Conclusion: AJL方法能有效进行功能变量选择和结构变点检测，可揭示疾病进展同步相变并识别预后标志物。

Abstract: In modern biomedical and econometric studies, longitudinal processes are often characterized by complex time-varying associations and abrupt regime shifts that are shared across correlated outcomes. Standard functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which prioritize smoothness, often fail to capture these dynamic structural features, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This article introduces Adaptive Joint Learning (AJL), a regularization framework designed to simultaneously perform functional variable selection and structural changepoint detection in multivariate time-varying coefficient models. We propose a convex optimization procedure that synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with fused regularization, effectively borrowing strength across multiple outcomes to enhance estimation efficiency. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the estimator in the ultra-high-dimensional regime (p >> n), establishing non-asymptotic error bounds and proving that AJL achieves the oracle property--performing as well as if the true active set and changepoint locations were known a priori. A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) data. The analysis uncovers synchronized phase transitions in disease progression and identifies a parsimonious set of time-varying prognostic markers.
