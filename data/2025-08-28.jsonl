However, when agents\nhave no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge:\nthe joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which\nslows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates\nthis issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not\non who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate\nfictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency\nof the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents'\nindividual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP. In\nessence, by aggregating the agents' actions, we reduce the action space without\nlosing the convergence guarantees. Using simulations, we provide empirical\nevidence on how this reduction accelerates convergence."}

Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

To address these concerns, the Input-Output\nMemory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating\nmemory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation\nand access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related\nside-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in\nperformance interference remains largely unexplored.

The accuracy with\nwhich the weights are mapped to areas and the simplicity of the polygons\nrepresenting the countries are the two classical optimization goals for\nmetaphorical maps. Mchedlidze and Schnorr [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic\nVertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022] presented a force-based algorithm that\ncreates metaphorical maps that balance between these two optimization goals.\nTheir maps look visually simple, but the accuracy of the maps is far from\noptimal - the countries' areas can vary up to 30% compared to required. In this\npaper, we provide a multi-fold extension of the algorithm in [Metaphoric Maps\nfor Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022]. More specifically:\n  1. Towards improving accuracy: We introduce the notion of region stiffness\nand suggest a technique for varying the stiffness based on the current pressure\nof map regions.\n  2. Towards maintaining simplicity: We introduce a weight coefficient to the\npressure force exerted on each polygon point based on whether the corresponding\npoint appears along a narrow passage.\n  3. Towards generality: We cover, in contrast to [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic\nVertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022], non-triangulated graphs. This is done by\neither generating points where more than three regions meet or by introducing\nholes in the metaphorical map.\n  We perform an extended experimental evaluation that, among other results,\nreveals that our algorithm is able to construct metaphorical maps with nearly\nperfect area accuracy with a little sacrifice in their simplicity."}

We explore what it\nmeans to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nembody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological\ntriggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under\nvarious stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a\nnovel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned\nbehavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our\nfindings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of\na Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves\nas a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt\npower-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare\ncompared to less constrained democratic models.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS.

Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to the\nobservations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of those\nobservations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used to\nconditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions without\nretraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations against\nsimulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model,\nand against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnick\nprocess model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is more\nefficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMC\ntechniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enables\nefficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictive\ndistributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods."}

We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization\nand graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar\nlabels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases\nmemorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less\nhomophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the\nincreased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'\nimplicit bias on using graph structure during learning.

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

Here we present a methodology for\nclassification of habitats based solely on ground-level imagery (photographs),\noffering improved validation and the ability to classify habitats at scale (for\nexample using citizen-science imagery). In collaboration with Natural England,\na public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England,\nthis study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to\nground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18\nclasses defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed\nusing resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to\nbalance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed\nand fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label\nto each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated\nstrong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and\nF1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean\nF1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and\nPeat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or\nambiguous classes scoring lower. These findings demonstrate the potential of\nthis approach for ecological monitoring. Ground-level imagery is readily\nobtained, and accurate computational methods for habitat classification based\non such data have many potential applications.

To address these challenges, we\npropose Agreement-based Reflective Inference System (ARIS), a hybrid approach\ncombining a Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger.

To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given\na goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with\nscenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power\ndynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to\nsatisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation\nrequired, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by\nan adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as\nverification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning\naccuracy.

We demonstrate\nthat the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the\ngenerative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the\nscore function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the\nbranching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as\nsymmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis\noffers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by\nthe controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks\nin information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible\noutcomes.

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality.

In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all\nsuccessful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated\ndataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.\nThis equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.\nEvaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,\nCODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art\namong open-source models."}
