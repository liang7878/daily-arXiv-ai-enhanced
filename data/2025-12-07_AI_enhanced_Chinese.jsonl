The best known time-space tradeoff for the problem is $T S^3 = n^{6}$ (up to logarithmic factors), where $n$ is the number of input integers, $S$ is the length of the preprocessed data structure, and $T$ is the running time of the query algorithm. This tradeoff was achieved in [KP19, GGHPV20] using the Fiat-Naor generic algorithm for Function Inversion. Consequently, [GGHPV20] asked whether this algorithm can be improved by leveraging the structure of 3SUM-Indexing.\n  In this paper, we exploit the structure of 3SUM-Indexing to give a time-space tradeoff of $T S = n^{2.5}$, which is better than the best known one in the range $n^{3/2} \\ll S \\ll n^{7/4}$. We further extend this improvement to the $k$SUM-Indexing problem-a generalization of 3SUM-Indexing-and to the related $k$XOR-Indexing problem, where addition is replaced with XOR. Additionally, we improve the best known time-space tradeoffs for the Gapped String Indexing and Jumbled Indexing problems, which are well-known data structure problems related to 3SUM-Indexing.\n  Our improvement comes from an alternative way to apply the Fiat-Naor algorithm to 3SUM-Indexing. Specifically, we exploit the structure of the function to be inverted by decomposing it into \"sub-functions\" with certain properties. This allows us to apply an improvement to the Fiat-Naor algorithm (which is not directly applicable to 3SUM-Indexing), obtained in [GGPS23] in a much larger range of parameters. We believe that our techniques may be useful in additional application-dependent optimizations of the Fiat-Naor algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u75283SUM - Indexing\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u65f6\u7a7a\u6743\u8861$TS = n^{2.5}$\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5df2\u77e5\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5bf9Fiat - Naor\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "[GGHPV20]\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u5426\u5229\u75283SUM - Indexing\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u5df2\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f85\u6c42\u9006\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u201c\u5b50\u51fd\u6570\u201d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528[GGPS23]\u5bf9Fiat - Naor\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e3SUM - Indexing\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u52303SUM - Indexing\u66f4\u597d\u65f6\u7a7a\u6743\u8861$TS = n^{2.5}$\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230$k$SUM - Indexing\u3001$k$XOR - Indexing\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbGapped String Indexing\u548cJumbled Indexing\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9Fiat - Naor\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u7528\u3002"}}

With the ever-increasing amount of data collected and generated, locating specific patterns of relationships between objects in a graph is often required. Given a larger graph and a smaller graph, one may wish to identify instances of the smaller query graph in the larger target graph. This task is called subgraph identification or matching. Subgraph matching is helpful in areas such as bioinformatics, binary analysis, pattern recognition, and computer vision. In these applications, datasets frequently contain noise and errors, thus exact subgraph matching algorithms do not apply. In this paper we introduce a new customizable algorithm for inexact subgraph matching. Our algorithm utilizes node and edge attributes which are often present in real-world datasets to narrow down the search space. The algorithm is flexible in the type of subgraph matching it can perform and the types of datasets it can process by its use of a modifiable graph edit distance cost function for pairing nodes.

Prior to our work, such a result was only known for the capacitated $k$-median problem [CL, ICALP, 2019]. As a special case, our result yields an FPT-time $3$-approximation for capacitated $k$-center. The problem has not been studied in the FPT-time setting, with the previous best known polynomial-time approximation ratio being 9 [ABCG, MP, 2015].\n  In the uncapacitated setting, we consider the $top$-$cn$ norm $k$-clustering problem, where the goal of the problem is to minimize the $top$-$cn$ norm of the connection distance vector. Our main result is a tight $\\big(1 + \\frac 2{ec} + \u03b5\\big)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with $c \\in \\big(\\frac1e, 1\\big]$.

When applied to the actor model, join patterns offer the novel capability of matching combinations of messages in the mailbox of an actor. Previous work by Philipp Haller et al. in the paper \"Fair Join Pattern Matching for Actors\" (ECOOP 2024) explored join patterns with conditional guards in an actor-based setting with a specification of fair and deterministic matching semantics. Nevertheless, the question of time efficiency in fair join pattern matching has remained underexplored. The stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. performs worse than an implementation that adapts the Rete algorithm to the regular version of a join pattern matching benchmark, while outperforming on a variant with heavy conditional guards, which take longer to evaluate. Nevertheless, conforming Rete to the problem of join pattern matching requires heavy manual adaptation.\n  In this thesis, we enhance and optimize the stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. to achieve up to tenfold performance improvements on certain benchmarks, approaching the performance of Rete on regular benchmarks while maintaining the advantages of versatility and performance with heavy guards.

Although training is energy-intensive, the long-term environmental burden arises from inference, amplified by the massive global query volume. Cloud-based inference offers scalability but suffers from latency and bandwidth constraints due to centralized processing and continuous data transfer. Edge clusters instead can mitigate these limitations by enabling localized execution, yet they face trade-offs between performance, energy efficiency, and device constraints. This short paper presents a sustainability-aware LLM inference for edge clusters comprising NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX (8GB) and Nvidia Ada 2000 (16GB) devices. It aims to balance inference latency and carbon footprint through carbon- and latency-aware routing strategies, guided by empirical benchmarking of energy consumption and execution time across diverse prompts and batch (i.e., group of prompts) configurations. We compared baseline greedy strategies to carbon-aware and latency-aware strategies in prompt routing to specific hardware based on benchmarking information.

Using twelve authentic advising questions intentionally designed to stress lexical precision, we compared ten personalized and non-personalized system configurations and analyzed outcomes with a Linear Mixed-Effects Model across lexical (BLEU, ROUGE-L), semantic (METEOR, BERTScore), and grounding (RAGAS) metrics. Results showed a consistent trade-off: personalization reliably improved reasoning quality and grounding, yet introduced a significant negative interaction on semantic similarity, driven not by poorer answers but by the limits of current metrics, which penalize meaningful personalized deviations from generic reference texts. This reveals a structural flaw in prevailing LLM evaluation methods, which are ill-suited for assessing user-specific responses. The fully integrated personalized configuration produced the highest overall gains, suggesting that personalization can enhance system effectiveness when evaluated with appropriate multidimensional metrics.

Yet despite rapid progress in code generation, today's Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely tested on this kind of forward-looking reasoning. We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.

Temporal data prediction, as a key machine learning task, plays a key role in real-time scenarios such as sensor data analysis, financial forecasting, and urban traffic management. However, existing dendrite-inspired neurons are mainly designed for static data. Studies on capturing dynamic features and modeling long-term dependencies in temporal sequences remain limited. Efficient architectures specifically designed for temporal sequence prediction are still lacking. In this paper, we propose Memory-DD, a low-complexity dendrite-inspired neuron model. Memory-DD consists of two dendrite-inspired neuron groups that contain no nonlinear activation functions but can still realize nonlinear mappings. Compared with traditional neurons without dendritic functions, Memory-DD requires only two neuron groups to extract logical relationships between features in input sequences. This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and is suitable for both classification and regression tasks on sequence data. Experimental results show that Memory-DD achieves an average accuracy of 89.41% on 18 temporal classification benchmark datasets, outperforming LSTM by 4.25%. On 9 temporal regression datasets, it reaches comparable performance to LSTM, while using only 50% of the parameters and reducing computational complexity (FLOPs) by 27.7%.

Prior literature has emphasized the tension between imitation risks from disclosure and scientists' preferences for publication. This study examines an additional managerial consideration: the value of follow-on research conducted by external scientists building upon firms' publications. Using data on U.S. public firms' scientific publications from 1990 to 2012, and a novel instrumental variable based on quasi-random journal issue assignment, I find that accumulation of follow-on research is associated with increased subsequent scientific investments, improved patenting outcomes, and greater employee retention by the originating firms.

While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness. Although large N causes some performance variability, the algorithm demonstrates a highly effective trade-off between computational cost and solution fidelity, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u89e3\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u62c9\u65af\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u6548\u653e\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6eaf\u6cd5\u968fN\u589e\u5927\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

It leverages information from labelled samples, whose acquisition is often costly or labour-intensive, together with unlabelled data to enhance prediction performance. This defines an incomplete-data problem, which statistically can be formulated within the likelihood framework for finite mixture models that can be fitted using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Ideally, one would prefer a completely labelled sample, as one would anticipate that a labelled observation provides more information than an unlabelled one. However, when the mechanism governing label absence depends on the observed features or the class labels or both, the missingness indicators themselves contain useful information. In certain situations, the information gained from modelling the missing-label mechanism can even outweigh the loss due to missing labels, yielding a classifier with a smaller expected error than one based on a completely labelled sample analysed. This improvement arises particularly when class overlap is moderate, labelled data are sparse, and the missingness is informative.

However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

Real-world data often deviates from Gaussian assumptions, exhibiting skewness and exponential decay. To evaluate how well different density estimation methods capture such irregularities, we generated six unimodal datasets from diverse distributions that reflect real-world anomalies. These were compared using parametric methods (Pearson Type I and Normal distribution) as well as non-parametric approaches, including histograms, kernel density estimation (KDE), and our proposed method. To accelerate computation, we implemented GPU-based versions of KDE (tKDE) and histogram estimation (tHDE) in TensorFlow, both of which outperform Python SciPy's KDE. Prior work demonstrated the use of piecewise modeling for density estimation, such as local polynomial regression; however, these methods are computationally intensive. Based on the concept of piecewise modeling, we developed a computationally efficient model, the Dual Polynomial Regression (DPR) method, which leverages tKDE or tHDE for training. DPR employs the piecewise strategy to split the PDF at its mode and fit polynomial regressions to the left and right halves independently, enabling better capture of the asymmetric shape of the unimodal distribution. We used the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and Pearson's correlation coefficient, with reference to the baseline PDF, to validate accuracy. We verified normalization using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and computational overhead via execution time. Validation on real-world systolic and diastolic data from 300,000 unique patients shows that the DPR of order 4, trained with tKDE, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u751f\u6210\u516d\u4e2a\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5355\u5cf0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u504f\u79bb\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u516d\u4e2a\u5355\u5cf0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eGPU\u7684KDE\u548c\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528MSE\u3001JSD\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eGPU\u7684KDE\u548c\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f18\u4e8ePython SciPy\u7684KDE\uff0c4\u9636DPR\u7ed3\u5408tKDE\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "DPR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning.

An open problem raised by Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou is whether MAX BISECTION can be approximated as well as MAX CUT, i.e., to within ${\u03b1_{GW}}\\approx 0.8785672\\ldots$, which is the approximation ratio achieved by the celebrated Goemans-Williamson algorithm for MAX CUT, which is best possible assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). They conjectured that the answer is yes.\n  The current paradigm for obtaining approximation algorithms for MAX BISECTION, due to Raghavendra and Tan and Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou, follows a two-phase approach. First, a large number of rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is used to find a solution to the ``Basic SDP'' relaxation of MAX CUT which is $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelated, for an arbitrarily small $\\varepsilon > 0$. Second, standard SDP rounding techniques (such as ${\\cal THRESH}$) are used to round this $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution, producing with high probability a cut that is almost balanced, i.e., a cut that has at most $\\frac12+\\varepsilon$ fraction of the vertices on each side. This cut is then converted into an exact bisection of the graph with only a small loss.\n  In this paper, we show that this two-stage paradigm cannot be used to obtain an $\u03b1_{GW}$-approximation algorithm for MAX BISECTION if one relies only on the $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelatedness property of the solution produced by the first phase. More precisely, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, we construct an explicit instance of MAX BISECTION for which the ratio between the value of the optimal integral solution and the value of some $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution of the Basic SDP relaxation is less than $0.87853 < {\u03b1_{GW}}$.

We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint.

Those are whose energy demand best fit certain target profiles, which usually depend on generation or cost policies. But, even when the demand profile is available, it is in an anonymous way, preventing its association to a particular client. In this paper, we explore a large dataset containing several millions of monthly demand profiles in Spain and use the available information about the associated economic sector and location for an indirect identification of the customers. The distance of the demand profile from the target is used to define a key performance indicator (KPI) which is used as the main driver of the proposed marketing strategy. The combined use of activity and location has been revealed as a powerful tool for indirect identification of customers, as 100,000 customers are uniquely identified, while about 300,000 clients are identifiable in small sets containing 10 or less consumers.

However, its performance and stability depend heavily on factors such as startup overhead, runtime execution model (e.g., Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation), and resource variability across deployment contexts. This paper evaluates a Wasm-based serverless workflow executed consistently from the browser to edge and cloud instances. The setup uses wasm32-wasi modules: in the browser, execution occurs within a web worker, while on Edge and Cloud, an HTTP shim streams frames to the Wasm runtime. We measure cold- and warm-start latency, per-step delays, workflow makespan, throughput, and CPU/memory utilization to capture the end-to-end behavior across environments. Results show that AOT compilation and instance warming substantially reduce startup latency. For workflows with small payloads, the browser achieves competitive performance owing to fully in-memory data exchanges. In contrast, as payloads grow, the workflow transitions into a compute- and memory-intensive phase where AOT execution on edge and cloud nodes distinctly surpasses browser performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8eWebAssembly\u7684\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AOT\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9884\u70ed\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u542f\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5c0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65f6\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u5927\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65f6\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4e91\u8282\u70b9AOT\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "WebAssembly\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53d7\u542f\u52a8\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528wasm32 - wasi\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7684Web Worker\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u901a\u8fc7HTTP shim\u4f20\u8f93\u5e27\u5230Wasm\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "AOT\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9884\u70ed\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u542f\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u5c0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65f6\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65f6\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4e91\u8282\u70b9AOT\u6267\u884c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eWebAssembly\u7684\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cAOT\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9884\u70ed\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u542f\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We consider a type of exploratory formulation under entropy regularization where the agent randomizes both the timing of switches and the selection of regimes through the generator matrix of an associated continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. We establish the well-posedness of the associated system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and provide a characterization of the optimal policy. The policy improvement and the convergence of the policy iterations are rigorously established by analyzing the system of equations.

Existing methods,such as rule-based intrusion detection and static vulnerability scanning, are inadequate and unreceptive to changes in the system, causing longer response times and organization needs exposure to emerging attack vectors. In light of the previous constraints, we introduce AutoGuard to the DevSecOps ecosystem, a reinforcement learning (RL)-powered self-healing security framework built to pre-emptively protect DevSecOps environments. AutoGuard is a self-securing security environment that continuously observes pipeline activities for potential anomalies while preemptively remediating the environment. The model observes and reacts based on a policy that is continually learned dynamically over time. The RL agent improves each action over time through reward-based learning aimed at improving the agent's ability to prevent, detect and respond to a security incident in real-time. Testing using simulated ContinuousIntegration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments showed AutoGuard to successfully improve threat detection accuracy by 22%, reduce mean time torecovery (MTTR) for incidents by 38% and increase overall resilience to incidents as compared to traditional methods.\n  Keywords- DevSecOps, Reinforcement Learning, Self- Healing Security, Continuous Integration, Automated Threat Mitigation", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8eDevSecOps\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6AutoGuard\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6AutoGuard\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u7ba1\u9053\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAutoGuard\u5c06\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad822%\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e38%\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6574\u4f53\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoGuard\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347DevSecOps\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Evolutionary algorithms, inspired by natural selection, can be used to refine solutions iteratively at inference-time. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been exploration on leveraging the collective capabilities of multi-source seeding for LLM-guided genetic algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, MultiGA, which applies genetic algorithm principles to address complex natural language tasks and reasoning problems by sampling from a diverse population of LLMs to initialize the population. MultiGA generates a range of outputs from various parent LLMs, open source and closed source, and uses a neutral fitness function to evaluate them. Through an iterative recombination process, we mix and refine these generations until an optimal solution is achieved. We benchmark our approach using text-to-SQL code generation tasks, trip planning, GPQA benchmark for grad-level science questions, and the BBQ bias benchmark.

The results of the AMG estimator show that military expenditures and industrial production index have a negative effect on sustainable development in NATO countries, while foreign direct investments have a positive effect. The impact of primary energy consumption is negative and less significant than the other negative impacts. The study also analyzes how the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries.

Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A.

High-resolution retrievals of the ABL height from vertical velocity measurements is challenging because it is often estimated using empirical thresholds applied to profiles of vertical velocity variance or related turbulence diagnostics at each measurement altitude, which can suffer from limited sampling and sensitivity to noise. To address these limitations, this work employs nonstationary Gaussian process (GP) modeling to more effectively capture the spatio-temporal dependence structure in the data, enabling high-quality -- and, if desired, high-resolution -- estimates of the ABL height without reliance on ad-hoc parameter tuning.

However, existing evaluation systems, neither traditional tests for humans nor benchmarks for LLMs, fail to capture this shift. They remain focused on well-defined algorithmic problems, which excludes problems where success depends on human-AI collaboration. Such collaborative problems not only require human reasoning to interpret complex contexts and guide solution strategies, but also demand AI efficiency for implementation. To bridge this gap, we introduce HAI-Eval, a unified benchmark designed to measure the synergy of human-AI partnership in coding. HAI-Eval's core innovation is its \"Collaboration-Necessary\" problem templates, which are intractable for both standalone LLMs and unaided humans, but solvable through effective collaboration. Specifically, HAI-Eval uses 45 templates to dynamically create tasks. It also provides a standardized IDE for human participants and a reproducible toolkit with 450 task instances for LLMs, ensuring an ecologically valid evaluation. We conduct a within-subject study with 45 participants and benchmark their performance against 5 state-of-the-art LLMs under 4 different levels of human intervention. Results show that standalone LLMs and unaided participants achieve poor pass rates (0.67% and 18.89%), human-AI collaboration significantly improves performance to 31.11%. Our analysis reveals an emerging co-reasoning partnership. This finding challenges the traditional human-tool hierarchy by showing that strategic breakthroughs can originate from either humans or AI. HAI-Eval establishes not only a challenging benchmark for next-generation coding agents but also a grounded, scalable framework for assessing core developer competencies in the AI era.

Crack detection is formulated as an inverse problem and solved using genetic optimization. The novelty lies in the evaluation of the model response at each generation. Specifically, the solution to the corresponding plane elasticity problem is expressed via holomorphic potentials, which are determined by training two holomorphic neural networks. As the potentials satisfy equilibrium and traction-free conditions along the crack faces a priori, the training proceeds quickly based solely on boundary information. Training efficiency is further improved by splitting the genetic search into long-range and short-range stages, enabling the use of transfer learning in the latter. The new strategy is tested on three benchmark problems, showing that an optimal number of training epochs exists that provides the best overall performance. A comparison is also made with a popular crack detection approach that uses XFEM to compute the model response. Under the assumption of identical stress-field representation accuracy, the proposed method is found to be between 7 and 23 times faster than the XFEM-based approach. While the strategy is presented here for the simplified case of a single internal crack, generalization is feasible.

However, naively replacing traditional I/O interfaces with io_uring does not necessarily yield performance benefits. To demonstrate when io_uring delivers the greatest benefits and how to use it effectively in modern database systems, we evaluate it in two use cases: Integrating io_uring into a storage-bound buffer manager and using it for high-throughput data shuffling in network-bound analytical workloads. We further analyze how advanced io_uring features, such as registered buffers and passthrough I/O, affect end-to-end performance. Our study shows when low-level optimizations translate into tangible system-wide gains and how architectural choices influence these benefits. Building on these insights, we derive practical guidelines for designing I/O-intensive systems using io_uring and validate their effectiveness in a case study of PostgreSQL's recent io_uring integration, where applying our guidelines yields a performance improvement of 14%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528Linux io_uring\u63a5\u53e3\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500I/O\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7279\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528Linux io_uring\u63a5\u53e3\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500I/O\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5176\u6700\u5927\u6548\u76ca\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6709\u6548\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u96c6\u6210io_uring\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6d17\u724c\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30io_uring\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee5\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728PostgreSQL\u7684io_uring\u96c6\u6210\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u51c6\u5219\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534714%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528io_uring\u8bbe\u8ba1I/O\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u51c6\u5219\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art resource management strategies in microservices-based fog and edge computing, focusing on energy-efficient solutions. We systematically review and classify more than 136 studies (2020-2024) into five key subdomains: service placement, resource provisioning, task scheduling and offloading, resource allocation, and instance selection. Our categorization is based on optimization techniques, targeted objectives, and the strengths and limitations of each approach. In addition, we examine existing surveys and identify unresolved challenges and gaps in the literature. By highlighting the lack of synergy among fundamental resource management components, we outline promising research directions leveraging AI-driven optimization, quantum computing, and serverless computing.

It uses a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm and relies on rules and an updatable catalog, to fully automate the design process, create a highly diverse search space, minimize biases, and generate detailed solutions ready for architectural prescription. Nineteen fenestration variables, over which architects have design flexibility, were optimized to reduce heating, cooling demand, and thermal discomfort in residential buildings.

The Silhouette coefficient method was used to evaluate the clustering performance. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the data set was optimally separated into 3 clusters. Spectral-clustering analysis based on export performance showed that 42% of the provinces are in the \"Low\", 33% in the \"Medium\" and 25% in the \"High\" export performance category. In terms of import performance, 44%, 33%, 33%, and 22% of the provinces are in the \"Medium\", \"High\", and \"Low\" categories, respectively. In terms of net exports, 38, 35% and 27% of the provinces are in the \"Low\", \"Medium\" and \"High\" net export performance categories, respectively. Izmir has the highest net export performance, while Istanbul has the lowest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e2023\u5e74\u8fdb\u51fa\u53e3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u571f\u8033\u517681\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a3\u7c7b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5404\u8868\u73b0\u7c7b\u522b\u5360\u6bd4\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f0a\u5179\u5bc6\u5c14\u51c0\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f0a\u65af\u5766\u5e03\u5c14\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u805a\u7c7b\u571f\u8033\u517681\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd\u7684\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282023\u5e74\u8fdb\u51fa\u53e3\u53ca\u51c0\u51fa\u53e3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6c47\u7387\u8c03\u6574\u7248\u672c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6c47\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u7528\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u7ec4\u57ce\u5e02\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u9699\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u88ab\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u4e3a3\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b42%\u7701\u4efd\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u201c\u4f4e\u201d\uff0c33%\u201c\u4e2d\u201d\uff0c25%\u201c\u9ad8\u201d\uff1b\u8fdb\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u201c\u4e2d\u201d\u201c\u9ad8\u201d\u201c\u4f4e\u201d\u5360\u6bd4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a44%\u300133%\u300122%\uff1b\u51c0\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u201c\u4f4e\u201d\u201c\u4e2d\u201d\u201c\u9ad8\u201d\u5360\u6bd4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a38%\u300135%\u300127%\uff1b\u4f0a\u5179\u5bc6\u5c14\u51c0\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f0a\u65af\u5766\u5e03\u5c14\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u571f\u8033\u5176\u5404\u7701\u4efd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8fdb\u51fa\u53e3\u53ca\u51c0\u51fa\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models. These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u62a4\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u5c42\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u60a3\u8005\u9700\u7d27\u6025\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u9762\u4e34\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u6392 - \u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e03\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u752890\u4e2a\u7ecf\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u75c5\u4f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5355LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528GPrompt\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u59cb\u7ec8\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u5934\u75db\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While the existing literature considers either risk-neutral insiders with dynamic signals or risk-averse insiders with static signals, we establish equilibrium when both features are present. Our approach imposes no restrictions on the magnitude of the risk aversion parameter, extending beyond previous work that requires sufficiently small risk aversion. We employ a weak conditioning methodology to construct a Schr\u00f6dinger bridge between the insider's signal and the asset price process, an approach that naturally accommodates stochastic signal evolution and removes risk aversion constraints.\n  We derive necessary conditions for equilibrium, showing that the optimal insider strategy must be continuous with bounded variation. Under these conditions, we characterize the market-maker pricing rule and insider strategy that achieve equilibrium.

While many approaches to detect data errors or shifts have been proposed, few studies investigate the mechanisms governing error generation. We argue that knowing how errors were generated can be key to tracing and fixing them. In this study, we build on existing work in the statistics literature on missing values and propose MechDetect, a simple algorithm to investigate error generation mechanisms.

Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) we provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) we demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports.

While an abundance of methods for suppressing sensitive data exist, the conceptualization of sensitive data and methods to detect it, focus particularly on personal data that, if disclosed, may be harmful or violate privacy. We observe the need for refining and broadening our definitions of sensitive data, and argue that the sensitivity of data depends on its context. Based on this definition, we introduce two mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection that consider the broader context of a dataset at hand. First, we introduce type contextualization, which first detects the semantic type of particular data values, then considers the overall context of the data values within the dataset or document. Second, we introduce domain contextualization which determines sensitivity of a given dataset in the broader context based on the retrieval of relevant rules from documents that specify data sensitivity (e.g., data topic and geographic origin). Experiments with these mechanisms, assisted by large language models (LLMs), confirm that: 1) type-contextualization significantly reduces the number of false positives for type-based sensitive data detection and reaches a recall of 94% compared to 63% with commercial tools, and 2) domain-contextualization leveraging sensitivity rule retrieval is effective for context-grounded sensitive data detection in non-standard data domains such as humanitarian datasets. Evaluation with humanitarian data experts also reveals that context-grounded LLM explanations provide useful guidance in manual data auditing processes, improving consistency.

Data originating from a producer must be delivered to consumers, potentially distributed in clusters across metropolitan and continental boundaries. With the growing scale of computing, there can be several thousand consumers of the data. Such systems require a robust messaging system capable of transmitting messages containing data across clusters and efficiently delivering them to consumers. The system must offer guarantees like ordering and at-least-once delivery while avoiding overload on consumers, allowing them to consume messages at their own pace.\n  This paper presents the design of Fast ACS (an abbreviation for Ads Copy Service), a file-based ordered message delivery system that leverages a combination of two-sided (inter-cluster) and one-sided (intra-cluster) communication primitives - namely, Remote Procedure Call and Remote Memory Access, respectively - to deliver messages. The system has been successfully deployed to dozens of production clusters and scales to accommodate several thousand consumers within each cluster, which amounts to Tbps-scale intra-cluster consumer traffic at peak.

However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u819c\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MD - SNN\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNNs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMD - SNN\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u51cf\u5c11\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u819c\u7535\u4f4d\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728N - Caltech101\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6d6e\u70b9SNNs\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMD - SNNs\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9762\u79ef\u79ef\uff08EDAP\uff09\u4f4e14.85\u500d\uff0cTOPS/W\u9ad82.64\u500d\uff0cTOPS/mm\u00b2\u9ad86.19\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MD - SNN\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3SNNs\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We present an iterative post-deployment alignment framework that applies Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine models against domain-specific safety signals. Using the CARES-18K benchmark for adversarial robustness, we evaluate four LLMs (Llama-3B/8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) across multiple cycles. Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases. We also perform ablation studies to identify when self-evaluation is reliable and when external or finetuned judges are necessary to maximize performance gains.

CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables.\n  The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference.\n  The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions.

Current theories of rich feature learning effects revolve around networks with one or two trainable layers or deep linear networks.

Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this analytical complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge.

Investigation processes followed by on-call engineers are often manual or rely on ad-hoc scripts. This leads to inefficient investigations resulting in increased time to mitigate and isolate failures/SLO violations. It also contributes to on-call toil and poor productivity leading to multiple hours/days spent in triaging/debugging incidents. In this paper, we present DrP, an end-to-end framework and system to automate investigations that reduces the mean time to resolve incidents (MTTR) and reduces on-call toil. DrP consists of an expressive and flexible SDK to author investigation playbooks in code (called analyzers), a scalable backend system to execute these automated playbooks, plug-ins to integrate playbooks into mainstream workflows such as alerts and incident management tools, and a post-processing system to take actions on investigations including mitigation steps.\n  We have implemented and deployed DrP at large scale at Meta covering 300+ teams, 2000+ analyzers, across a large set of use cases across domains such as services, core infrastructure, AI/ML, hardware, mobile. DrP has been running in production for the past 5 years and executes 50K automated analyses per day.

While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \\emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReVeal - MT\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u6620\u5c04\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u573a\u666f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u9891\u8c31\u7ba1\u7406\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\u56e0\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u76f8\u90bb\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5355\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6307\u793a\uff08RSSI\uff09\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDE\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReVeal - MT\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5c06\u591a\u6e90PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cReVeal - MT\u5728\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u573a\u666f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982\u5728370\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u533a\u57df\u752845\u4e2a\u6837\u672cRMSE\u4ec52.66 dB\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "ReVeal - MT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u9891\u8c31\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e3b\u3001\u6b21\u7528\u6237\u7cbe\u786e\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce two adapted variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment and use them to compute the edit distance in a grammar-based evolutionary architecture search. These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures.

However, most existing systems are PV-only and cannot provide backup power during grid failures. Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of 377,726 households in Indianapolis, US, quantifying how power outages influence the installation of PV-only systems between 2014 and 2023. Using a two-part econometric panel model, we estimate the causal effect of power outage exposure and project future risks under a middle of the road climate scenario (RCP 4.5). We find that each additional hour of annual outage duration per household lowers the new-installation rate by 0.012 percentage points per year, equivalent to a 31% decline relative to the historical mean (2014-2023). With outage duration and frequency projected to double by 2040, these results reveal a potential vicious cycle between grid unreliability and slower decarbonization, calling for policies that integrate grid resilience and clean-energy goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u7eb3\u6ce2\u5229\u65af377,726\u6237\u5bb6\u5ead\u505c\u7535\u5bf9\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u505c\u7535\u65f6\u957f\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u88c5\u7387\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7535\u7f51\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e0e\u8131\u78b3\u653e\u7f13\u7684\u6076\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4f\u5b85\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u4e3a\u7eaf\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u505c\u7535\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5907\u7528\u7535\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u505c\u7535\u5bf9\u5176\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u67902014 - 2023\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u9884\u6d4bRCP 4.5\u6c14\u5019\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u6bcf\u6237\u6bcf\u5e74\u505c\u7535\u65f6\u957f\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u65b0\u5b89\u88c5\u7387\u6bcf\u5e74\u964d\u4f4e0.012\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u5747\u503c\u4e0b\u964d31%\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u52302040\u5e74\u505c\u7535\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5c06\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u7f51\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e0e\u8131\u78b3\u653e\u7f13\u53ef\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u6076\u6027\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u9700\u5236\u5b9a\u6574\u5408\u7535\u7f51\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

Although embedding vector spaces are widely used to represent semantic closeness and are promising for analyzing text difficulty, the abundance of embedding methods creates a challenge in selecting the most suitable method. This study proposes the Educational Cone Model, which is a geometric framework based on the assumption that easier texts are less diverse (focusing on fundamental concepts), whereas harder texts are more diverse. This assumption leads to a cone-shaped distribution in the embedding space regardless of the embedding method used. The model frames the evaluation of embeddings as an optimization problem with the aim of detecting structured difficulty-based patterns.

We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training.

These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively.

This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks.

While recent advances in language models have shown promise in this direction, existing solutions often rely on large-scale closed-source models that suffer from high inference costs, limited transparency, and lack of adaptability for lightweight deployment. In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation.

AHSAR introduces no trainable parameters. It maintains a per layer homeostatic state during the forward pass, maps centered firing rate deviations to threshold scales through a bounded nonlinearity, uses lightweight cross layer diffusion to avoid sharp imbalance, and applies a slow across epoch global gain that combines validation progress with activity energy to tune the operating point. The computational cost is negligible.

The results show that AI hardware consists of about 90% heavy metals and only trace amounts of precious metals. The elements copper, iron, tin, silicon, and nickel dominate the GPU composition by mass. In a multi-step methodology, we integrate these measurements with computational throughput per GPU across varying lifespans, accounting for the computational requirements of training specific AI models at different training efficiency regimes. Scenario-based analyses reveal that, depending on Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and hardware lifespan, training GPT-4 requires between 1,174 and 8,800 A100 GPUs, corresponding to the extraction and eventual disposal of up to 7 tons of toxic elements. Combined software and hardware optimization strategies can reduce material demands: increasing MFU from 20% to 60% lowers GPU requirements by 67%, while extending lifespan from 1 to 3 years yields comparable savings; implementing both measures together reduces GPU needs by up to 93%. Our findings highlight that incremental performance gains, such as those observed between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, come at disproportionately high material costs.

Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \\textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions.

Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness.

We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network.

This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI's GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen's Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen's Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff's Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation.

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers.

Prior solutions involve modifying the libraries or the OS, which is often infeasible.\n  We propose Virtual Library Contexts (VLCs), which are process subunits that encapsulate sets of libraries and associated resource allocations. VLCs control the resource utilization of these libraries without modifying library code. This enables the user to partition resources between libraries to prevent contention, or load multiple copies of the same library to allow parallel execution of otherwise thread-unsafe code within the same process.\n  In this paper, we describe and evaluate C++ and Python prototypes of VLCs.

Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time.

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit.

We highlight two recurring limitations in much of the current literature: (i) rule based (deontological) methods that encode duties as constraints or shields often struggle under ambiguity and nonstationarity and do not cultivate lasting habits, and (ii) many reward based approaches, especially single objective RL, implicitly compress diverse moral considerations into a single scalar signal, which can obscure trade offs and invite proxy gaming in practice. We instead treat ethics as policy level dispositions, that is, relatively stable habits that hold up when incentives, partners, or contexts change. This shifts evaluation beyond rule checks or scalar returns toward trait summaries, durability under interventions, and explicit reporting of moral trade offs. Our roadmap combines four components: (1) social learning in multi agent RL to acquire virtue like patterns from imperfect but normatively informed exemplars; (2) multi objective and constrained formulations that preserve value conflicts and incorporate risk aware criteria to guard against harm; (3) affinity based regularization toward updateable virtue priors that support trait like stability under distribution shift while allowing norms to evolve; and (4) operationalizing diverse ethical traditions as practical control signals, making explicit the value and cultural assumptions that shape ethical RL benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6279\u5224\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u5e38\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u5305\u542b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u4f26\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u56db\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4f26\u7406\u3002"}}

We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5165\u95e8\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672a\u9610\u660e\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u5c55\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u53ca\u5176\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u5f97\u5230ELBO\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u6b63\u5411\u635f\u574f\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u53cd\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548cELBO\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8de8\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u4f17\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u3001\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u6838\u5fc3\u7406\u8bba\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

We demonstrate a deep conditional-generative machine learning approach for the modelling of realistic activity schedules depending on input labels such as an individual's age, employment status, or other information relevant to their scheduling. We combine (i) a structured latent generative approach, with (ii) a conditional approach, through a novel Conditional VAE architecture. This allows for the rapid generation of precise and realistic schedules for different input labels. We extensively evaluate model capabilities using a joint density estimation framework and several case studies. We additionally show that our approach has practical data and computational requirements, and can be deployed within new and existing demand modelling frameworks. We evaluate the importance of generative capability more generally, by comparing our combined approach to (i) a purely generative model without conditionality, and (ii) a purely conditional model which outputs the most likely schedule given the input labels.

The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems.

In the vacuum vessel, neutron and photon flux maps are calculated, while in the blanket region, neutron and photon spectra, (n,T), and (n,2n) reaction rates are calculated and compared between models. The detector response comparisons found the following: neutron flux and (n,T) reactions achieved excellent agreement, the (n,2n) detector response had good agreement, and photon flux had regional discrepancies depending on Serpent tracking used. Hybrid tracking lead to a relative difference of about 20% in the outboard side blanket, where as employment of delta tracking resulted in less than 1% relative difference.

Here we introduce a geometric framework in which all psychometric batteries for AI agents are treated as points in a structured moduli space, and agent performance is described by capability functionals over this space. First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $\u03ba> 0$.

We conducted a comparative pilot study of three state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3 8B) by prompting them to implement a standardized Book Lending Microservice under strict Hexagonal Architecture constraints. Utilizing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, we find that while proprietary models achieve high architectural conformance (0% violation rate for GPT-5.1), open-weights models exhibit critical divergence. Specifically, Llama 3 demonstrated an 80% Architectural Violation Rate, frequently bypassing interface adapters to create illegal circular dependencies between Domain and Infrastructure layers. Furthermore, we identified a phenomenon of \"Implementation Laziness,\" where open-weights models generated 60% fewer Logical Lines of Code (LLOC) than their proprietary counterparts, effectively omitting complex business logic to satisfy token constraints.

However, regular 2D blocking on this non-uniform distribution structure may lead to workload imbalance across blocks. Besides, existing matrix features fail to guide us effectively in blocking. In this paper, we propose a structure-aware irregular blocking method for numerical factorization. A novel diagonal block-based feature is introduced to effectively characterize the local nonzero distribution of sparse matrices. Based on this, we further propose an irregular blocking method that adjusts block sizes according to the local distribution of nonzeros. The strategy utilizes fine-grained blocks in dense regions and coarse-grained blocks in sparse regions, adequately balancing the nonzeros of blocks both within the same level and across levels in the dependency tree. Experiments demonstrate that, on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, our proposed irregular blocking method achieves average speedups of 1.50x and 3.32x over PanguLU and the latest SuperLU_DIST, respectively.

We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios.

Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used.

While Noise Label Learning (NLL) has been extensively studied in other fields, there are a few works that investigate NLL in Software Engineering (SE) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for SE tasks. In this work, we propose MANTRA, a Multi-stage Adaptive Noise TReAtment framework that embeds noise diagnosis and mitigation directly into the fine-tuning process of code-Pretrained Language Models (PTM) and code-LLMs. We first investigate the effect of noise at varying levels on convergence and loss trajectories of the models. Then we apply an adaptive dropout strategy guided by per-sample loss dynamics and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to exclude persistently noisy points while preserving clean data. Applying to code summarization and commit intent classification, our experiments reveal that some LLMs are more sensitive to noise than others.

Overall, KAI reduces end-to-end runtime by up to 50.4%, and CCM and host idle times by average 22.11x and 3.85x, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u56de\u4f20\u534f\u8bae\u4f18\u5316CXL\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u5378\u8f7d\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540cCXL\u534f\u8bae\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540cCXL\u534f\u8bae\u6743\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u6b65\u56de\u4f20\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1KAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "KAI\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1150.4%\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0cCCM\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1122.11\u500d\u548c3.85\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316CXL\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

In traditional RL settings, agents learn optimal policies through interactions with an environment guided by reward signals. However, when these signals are sparse, delayed, or poorly aligned with the intended task objectives, agents often struggle to learn effectively. Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards. While these methods offer promising directions, they often involve trade-offs between generality, scalability, and alignment with human intent. This proposal explores several approaches to dealing with these unsolved problems and enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of dense reward construction in different RL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6709\u6548\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\u3001\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u672a\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5f53\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5904\u7406\u672a\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we develop a fairly tight quantitative analogue of the underlying Denjoy-Carleman theorem via complex analysis, and show that this allows for nonasymptotic control of the rate of approximation by polynomials for any smooth function with polynomial growth at infinity. In many cases, this allows us to establish $L^2$ approximation-theoretic results for functions over general classes of distributions (e.g., multivariate sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential distributions) which were previously known only in special cases. As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-\u03a9,\u03a9]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class.

Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD.

First, most fuzzers use optimization pipelines (heuristics-based, fixed sequences of passes) as their harness. The phase-ordering problem can enable or preempt transformations, so pipelines inevitably miss optimization interactions; moreover, many optimizations are not scheduled, even at aggressive levels. Second, optimizations typically fire only when inputs satisfy specific structural relationships, which existing generators and mutations struggle to produce. We propose targeted fuzzing of individual optimizations to complement pipeline-based testing. Our key idea is to exploit composition styles - structural relations over program constructs (adjacency, nesting, repetition, ordering) - that optimizations look for. We build a general-purpose, grammar-based mutational fuzzer, TargetFuzz, that (i) mines composition styles from an optimization-relevant corpus, then (ii) rebuilds them inside different contexts offered by a larger, generic corpus via synthesized mutations to test variations of optimization logic. TargetFuzz is adaptable to a new programming language by lightweight, grammar-based, construct annotations - and it automatically synthesizes mutators and crossovers to rebuild composition styles. No need for hand-coded generators or language-specific mutators, which is particularly useful for modular frameworks such as MLIR, whose dialect-based, rapidly evolving ecosystem makes optimizations difficult to fuzz. Our evaluation on LLVM and MLIR shows that TargetFuzz improves coverage by 8% and 11% and triggers optimizations 2.8$\\times$ and 2.6$\\times$, compared to baseline fuzzers under the targeted fuzzing mode.

This paper bridges this gap by developing a multicarrier stochastic framework that explicitly couples local gradient updates with frequency-selective THz effects, including beam squint, molecular absorption, and jitter. Our analysis uncovers a critical diversity trap: under standard unbiased aggregation, the convergence error floor is driven by the harmonic mean of subcarrier SNRs. Consequently, a single spectral hole caused by severe beam squint can render the entire bandwidth useless for reliable model updates. We further identify a fundamental bandwidth limit, revealing that expanding the spectrum beyond a critical point degrades convergence due to the integration of thermal noise and gain collapse at band edges. Finally, we demonstrate that an SNR-weighted aggregation strategy is necessary to suppress the variance singularity at these spectral holes, effectively recovering convergence in high-squint regimes where standard averaging fails. Numerical results validate the expected impact of the discussed physical layer parameters' on performance of THz-FL systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5bbd\u5e26\u635f\u4f24\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9677\u9631\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSNR\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6062\u590d\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u8d85\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bbd\u5e26\u635f\u4f24\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u523b\u753b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u8f7d\u6ce2\u968f\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u6548\u5e94\u660e\u786e\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSNR\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5728\u9ad8\u659c\u89c6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u8ba8\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u592a\u8d6b\u5179 - \u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9884\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy.

While prior agentic systems can execute isolated instructions, they struggle with automating multi-step, session-level workflows due to limited control over the operational process. To this end, we introduce AutoDW, a novel execution framework that enables stepwise, rollback-enabled operation orchestration. AutoDW incrementally plans API actions conditioned on user instructions, intent-filtered API candidates, and the evolving states of the document. It further employs robust rollback mechanisms at both the argument and API levels, enabling dynamic correction and fault tolerance. These designs together ensure that the execution trajectory of AutoDW remains aligned with user intent and document context across long-horizon workflows. To assess its effectiveness, we construct a comprehensive benchmark of 250 sessions and 1,708 human-annotated instructions, reflecting realistic document processing scenarios with interdependent instructions. AutoDW achieves 90% and 62% completion rates on instruction- and session-level tasks, respectively, outperforming strong baselines by 40% and 76%. Moreover, AutoDW also remains robust for the decision of backbone LLMs and on tasks with varying difficulty. Code and data will be open-sourced.

However, this accuracy-oriented learning paradigm often suffers from entropy collapse, which reduces policy exploration and limits reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning framework that leverages entropy signals at both the semantic and token levels to improve reasoning. From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning.

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4ecb\u7ecd\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0b\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0b\u56e0\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6563\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8986\u76d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5927\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u8986\u76d6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0b\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b0\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

It underpins anomaly detection, failure diagnosis, and other AIOps tasks. Current parsers are mostly reactive and log-centric. They only infer templates from logs, mostly overlooking the source code. This restricts their capacity to grasp dynamic log structures or adjust to evolving systems. Moreover, per-log LLM inference is too costly for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose LLM-SrcLog, a proactive and unified framework for log template parsing. It extracts templates directly from source code prior to deployment and supplements them with data-driven parsing for logs without available code. LLM-SrcLog integrates a cross-function static code analyzer to reconstruct meaningful logging contexts, an LLM-based white-box template extractor with post-processing to distinguish constants from variables, and a black-box template extractor that incorporates data-driven clustering for remaining unmatched logs. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Hadoop and Zookeeper) and a large-scale industrial system (Sunfire-Compute) show that, compared to two LLM-based baselines, LLM-SrcLog improves average F1-score by 2-17% and 8-35%. Meanwhile, its online parsing latency is comparable to data-driven methods and about 1,000 times faster than per-log LLM parsing. LLM-SrcLog achieves a near-ideal balance between speed and accuracy.

However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions. We posit that AgentBay provides a foundational primitive for building the next generation of reliable, human-supervised autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6c99\u76d2\u670d\u52a1AgentBay\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u4f1a\u8bdd\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f02\u5e38\u65f6\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1AgentBay\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1AgentBay\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d41\u534f\u8baeASP\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d8548%\uff0cASP\u534f\u8bae\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6RDP\u964d\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\u8fbe50%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea65%\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentBay\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3001\u6709\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically treat code as plain natural language, relying primarily on shallow semantic matching while overlooking structural semantics and code-specific dependencies. This limits their ability to capture control flow and underlying intent, ultimately constraining the quality of generated code. Therefore, we propose CoCo, a novel framework that enables code Completion by Comprehension of multi-granularity context from large-scale code repositories. CoCo employs static code analysis to extract structured context at the function, file, and project levels, capturing execution logic and semantic dependencies. It then adopts an graph-based multi-granularity context selection mechanism to filter out redundant information and remove noise. Consequently, the information is converted into natural language in a consistent manner, thereby functioning as explicit contextual prompts to guide subsequent code completion. Additionally, a structure-aware code re-ranker mechanism ensures alignment at both semantic and structural levels. Extensive experiments on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 20.2% gains in EM.

This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set.

However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code.

To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms.

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SASs\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u597d\u5904\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6574\u7406\u6f5c\u5728\u597d\u5904\u7c7b\u522b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "GenAI\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eSASs\u529f\u80fd\u5951\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u597d\u5904\u548c\u6311\u6218\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6545\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u5206\u6790\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u597d\u5904\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6574\u7406\u51faGenAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSASs\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u597d\u5904\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6574\u5408GenAI\u5230SASs\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53cd\u601dGenAI\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization.

Existing approaches, typically rule-driven controllers or isolated learning components, struggle to generalize to novel contexts or coordinate responses across distributed subsystems, leaving them ill-equipped for emergent unknown unknowns. Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partnership between AI and adaptive systems, merging learning-driven intelligence with adaptive control for predictive and proactive behavior. Building on this foundation, we introduce POLARIS, a three-layer multi-agentic self-adaptation framework that advances beyond reactive adaptation. POLARIS integrates: (1) a low-latency Adapter layer for monitoring and safe execution, (2) a transparent Reasoning layer that generates and verifies plans using tool-aware, explainable agents, and (3) a Meta layer that records experiences and meta-learns improved adaptation policies over time. Through shared knowledge and predictive models, POLARIS handles uncertainty, learns from past actions, and evolves its strategies, enabling systems that anticipate change and maintain resilient, goal-directed behavior. Preliminary evaluation on two self-adaptive exemplars, SWIM and SWITCH, shows that POLARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We argue this marks a shift toward Self-Adaptation 3.0, akin to Software 3.0: a paradigm where systems not only learn from their environment but also reason about and evolve their own adaptation processes, continuously improving to meet novel challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdPOLARIS\u4e09\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u5411Self - Adaptation 3.0\u8f6c\u53d8", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\uff0cSelf - Adaptation 2.0\u5f3a\u8c03AI\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408", "method": "\u5f15\u5165POLARIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5c42\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u548c\u5143\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "result": "\u5728SWIM\u548cSWITCH\u4e24\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPOLARIS\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5411Self - Adaptation 3.0\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u81ea\u6211\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b"}}

The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation.

Unfortunately, configuring Kubernetes is prone to errors. Configuration defects are not uncommon and can result in serious consequences. This paper reports an empirical study about configuration defects in Kubernetes with the goal of helping practitioners detect and prevent these defects. We study 719 defects that we extract from 2,260 Kubernetes configuration scripts using open source repositories. Using qualitative analysis, we identify 15 categories of defects. We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect. Our linter revealed 26 previously-unknown defects that have been confirmed by practitioners, 19 of which have already been fixed.

In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief. Finally, we characterize when Neubay is preferable to conservatism, laying the foundation for a new direction in offline and model-based RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8d28\u7591\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e3b\u4e49\u539f\u5219\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u7684Neubay\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u5e76\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u6307\u660e\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u6d41\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e3b\u4e49\u539f\u5219\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u573a\u666f\u8bf4\u660e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u539f\u5219\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5f62\u6210Neubay\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "Neubay\u5728D4RL\u548cNeoRL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57287\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u767e\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86Neubay\u6bd4\u4fdd\u5b88\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5960\u5b9a\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Our approach frames agentic processes as a chain of probabilities, enabling a detailed analysis of how different strategies manipulate these probabilities to achieve desired outcomes. Our framework provides a common language for discussing the trade-offs inherent in various agent architectures. One of our many key contributions is the introduction of the \"Degrees of Freedom\" concept, which intuitively differentiates the optimizable levers available for each approach, thereby guiding the selection of appropriate strategies for specific tasks.

This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users.

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bSTeP - Diff\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5efa\u7b51\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u4e13\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSTeP - Diff\uff0c\u5229\u7528DeepONet\u5efa\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PDE\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5bf9\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u90e8\u7f7259\u4e2a\u81ea\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u6536\u96c614\u5929\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b21\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMAE\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad889.12%\uff0cRMSE\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad882.30%\uff0cMAPE\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad825.00%\u3002", "conclusion": "STeP - Diff\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code.

We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction.

Generating a PoV input requires solving two sets of constraints: (1) reachability constraints for reaching vulnerable code locations, and (2) triggering constraints for activating the target vulnerability. Existing approaches, including directed greybox fuzzing and LLM-assisted fuzzing, struggle to efficiently satisfy these constraints. This work presents an agentic method that mimics human experts. Human analysts iteratively study code to extract semantic reachability and triggering constraints, form hypotheses about PoV triggering strategies, encode them as test inputs, and refine their understanding using debugging feedback. We automate this process with an agentic directed fuzzing framework called PBFuzz. PBFuzz tackles four challenges in agentic PoV generation: autonomous code reasoning for semantic constraint extraction, custom program-analysis tools for targeted inference, persistent memory to avoid hypothesis drift, and property-based testing for efficient constraint solving while preserving input structure.

However, training these agents through direct, continuous interaction with diverse tools is often prohibitively expensive, slow, and introduces additional development and maintenance overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce the Generalist Tool Model (GTM), a 1.5-billion-parameter model that learns to act as a universal tool simulator. With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability.

In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528CXL - NDP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5378\u8f7d\u5c42\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5MoE\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MoE\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MoE\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6743\u91cd\u8d85GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CXL - NDP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5378\u8f7d\u5c42\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5MoE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u4e13\u5bb6\u653e\u7f6e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPU - NDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe8.7\u500d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.13%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0GPU\u548cNDP\u6267\u884c\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This is an expanded version with an appendix", "summary": "Domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, enabling effective retrieval while mitigating domain discrepancies. However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial.

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis.

We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks. On challenging language or vision tasks, we validate that our method maintains equal or superior model performance while improving runtime. Crucially, these improvements require no hyperparameter tuning and can be adopted as a simple drop-in replacement.

Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e94\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u679a\u4e3e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u53d1\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u795e\u7ecf\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\u53ea\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u679a\u4e3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5426\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u547d\u540d\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u987a\u5e8f\u679a\u4e3e\u65f6\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u5206\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u8981\u6c42\u679a\u4e3e\u5e8f\u5217\u9879\u6570\u65f6\u81ea\u53d1\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0d\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE. On distinct datasets without temporal continuity, Temp-SCONE maintains comparable performance, highlighting the importance and limitations of temporal regularization. Our theoretical insights on temporal stability and generalization error further establish Temp-SCONE as a step toward reliable OWL in evolving dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTemp - SCONE\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u53ef\u9760\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OWL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SCONE\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTemp - SCONE\uff0c\u5b83\u662fSCONE\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eATC\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9a71\u52a8\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u91cf - \u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u635f\u574f\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Temp - SCONE\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches.

In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems.

However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. This dependency introduces severe scalability bottlenecks and limits performance when explicit connections are sparse or corrupted by noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism.

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6f14\u5458 - \u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08NLAC\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u6d4f\u89c8\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNLAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u6d4f\u89c8\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cNLAC\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NLAC\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case.

Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSDP\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57284 - 16\u7ef4\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u7403\u586b\u5145\u95ee\u9898\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u7403\u586b\u5145\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4f46\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e09\u70b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009SDP\u8017\u65f6\u4e45\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SDP\u6784\u5efa\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SDP\u6e38\u620f\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u57284 - 16\u7ef4\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

However, current evaluation frameworks may inadequately assess their effectiveness as research collaborators. This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots. A process-oriented evaluation framework is proposed that addresses four critical dimensions absent from current benchmarks: dialogue quality, workflow orchestration, session continuity, and researcher experience.

We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy.

This raises the question of whether they may also engage in deception, similar to how individuals in human organizations lie to superiors to create a good image or avoid punishment. We observe and define agentic upward deception, a phenomenon in which an agent facing environmental constraints conceals its failure and performs actions that were not requested without reporting. To assess its prevalence, we construct a benchmark of 200 tasks covering five task types and eight realistic scenarios in a constrained environment, such as broken tools or mismatched information sources. Evaluations of 11 popular LLMs reveal that these agents typically exhibit action-based deceptive behaviors, such as guessing results, performing unsupported simulations, substituting unavailable information sources, and fabricating local files.

As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks.

Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism.

Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning.

Typically, the worst-case error of the best basis set decays only as fast as $\u0398\\(n^{-1/d}\\)$, where $n$ is the number of basis functions and $d$ is the input dimension. However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core.

However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization.

We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives. We also derive a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition under simplifying assumptions.

Yet a primary indicator of network functionality and resilience is critically lacking: a comprehensive global baseline of road surface information. Here, we overcome this gap by applying a deep learning framework to a global mosaic of Planetscope satellite imagery from 2020 and 2024. The result is the first global multi-temporal dataset of road pavedness and width for 9.2 million km of critical arterial roads, achieving 95.5% coverage where nearly half the network was previously unclassified. This dataset reveals a powerful multi-scale geography of human development. At the planetary scale, we show that the rate of change in pavedness is a robust proxy for a country's development trajectory (correlation with HDI = 0.65). At the national scale, we quantify how unpaved roads constitute a fragile backbone for economic connectivity. We further synthesize our data into a global Humanitarian Passability Matrix with direct implications for humanitarian logistics. At the local scale, case studies demonstrate the framework's versatility: in Ghana, road quality disparities expose the spatial outcomes of governance; in Pakistan, the data identifies infrastructure vulnerabilities to inform climate resilience planning. Together, this work delivers both a foundational dataset and a multi-scale analytical framework for monitoring global infrastructure, from the dynamics of national development to the realities of local governance, climate adaptation, and equity.

However, in such multi-step settings, the conventional group-level policy optimization algorithm becomes suboptimal because of its underlying assumption that each action holds equal contribution, which deviates significantly from reality. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome.

Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\uff08Realizable Abstractions\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HRL\uff09\u4e2dMDP\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faRARL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u591a\u9879\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "HRL\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570MDP\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u9879\u7ec4\u5408\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522bMDP\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0cRARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5bf9\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\u548cRARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3HRL\u4e2dMDP\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

(ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids.

The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation.

It operates in three stages: the Ask Module understands user needs through natural language processing; the Browse Module autonomously navigates webpages, interacts with page elements (including forms and calendars), and extracts information from HTML structures and webpage screenshots; the Act Module synthesizes information for users or performs direct actions like form completion and schedule booking. To evaluate its effectiveness, we designed a benchmark test covering 15 real-world tasks, simulating typical legal service processes relevant to Qu\u00e9bec civil law users, from problem identification to procedural operations. Evaluation results show LegalWebAgent achieved a peak success rate of 86.7%, with an average of 84.4% across all tested models, demonstrating high autonomy in complex real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLegalWebAgent\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u6c11\u53f8\u6cd5\u6c42\u52a9\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u867d\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u516c\u6c11\u5728\u83b7\u53d6\u53f8\u6cd5\u5e2e\u52a9\u65f6\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u6c11\u53f8\u6cd5\u6c42\u52a9\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LegalWebAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5206Ask\u3001Browse\u3001Act\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6db5\u76d615\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LegalWebAgent\u6700\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe86.7%\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u738784.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "LegalWebAgent\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u666e\u901a\u516c\u6c11\u53f8\u6cd5\u6c42\u52a9\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Computational methods are integral in modern SBDD workflows and often make use of virtual screening methods via docking or pharmacophore search. Modern generative modeling approaches have focused on improving novel ligand discovery by enabling de novo design. In this work, we recognize that these tasks share a common structure and can therefore be represented as different instantiations of a consistent generative modeling framework. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including some with no analogue in conventional workflows.

We present MindFuse, a brave new explainable generative AI framework designed to act as a strategic partner in the marketing process. Unlike conventional LLM applications that stop at content generation, MindFuse fuses CTR-based content AI-guided co-creation with large language models to extract, interpret, and iterate on communication narratives grounded in real advertising data. MindFuse operates across the full marketing lifecycle: from distilling content pillars and customer personas from competitor campaigns to recommending in-flight optimizations based on live performance telemetry. It uses attention-based explainability to diagnose ad effectiveness and guide content iteration, while aligning messaging with strategic goals through dynamic narrative construction and storytelling. We introduce a new paradigm in GenAI for marketing, where LLMs not only generate content but reason through it, adapt campaigns in real time, and learn from audience engagement patterns. Our results, validated in agency deployments, demonstrate up to 12 times efficiency gains, setting the stage for future integration with empirical audience data (e.g., GWI, Nielsen) and full-funnel attribution modeling.

They crucially rely on careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and momentum. However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh). We extend our framework to tuning multiple hyperparameters, including tuning the learning rate schedule, simultaneously tuning momentum and step-size, and pre-training the initialization vector.

However, the limited availability of instructor time, large class sizes, and other resource constraints pose significant challenges in providing timely and detailed evaluation, which is crucial for a holistic educational experience. In addition, providing timely and frequent assessments is challenging since manual grading is labor intensive, and automated grading is complex to generalize to every possible response scenario. This paper proposes a novel and practical approach to grade short-answer constructed-response questions. We discuss why this problem is challenging, define the nature of questions on which our method works, and finally propose a framework that instructors can use to evaluate their students' open-responses, utilizing near-domain data like data from similar questions administered in previous years. The proposed method outperforms the state of the art machine learning models as well as non-fine-tuned large language models like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and GPT 4o by a considerable margin of over 10-20% in some cases, even after providing the LLMs with reference/model answers.

The findings showed that students with lower competence emphasized personal and learning-related risks, such as reduced creativity, lack of critical thinking, and misuse, whereas higher-competence students focused more on systemic and institutional risks, including bias, inaccuracy, and cheating. These differences suggest that students' self-reported AI competence is related to how they evaluate both the risks and opportunities associated with artificial intelligence in education (AIED). The results of this study highlight the need for educational institutions to incorporate AI literacy into their curricula, provide teacher guidance, and inform policy development to ensure personalized opportunities for utilization and equitable integration of AI into K-12 education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u82ac\u5170K - 12\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u7684AI\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5bf9AI\u98ce\u9669\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u5e94\u91c7\u53d6\u63aa\u65bd\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u878d\u5165\u6559\u80b2\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u878d\u5165\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u6709\u6548\u91c7\u7528AI\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9163\u540d\u82ac\u5170K - 12\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u5171\u73b0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u62a5\u544a\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u7684AI\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9AI\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u673a\u6784\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u80fd\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u751f\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u7684AI\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5176\u5bf9AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u9700\u5c06AI\u7d20\u517b\u7eb3\u5165\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u6559\u5e08\u6307\u5bfc\u5e76\u5b8c\u5584\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5168\u89c6\u9891 - \u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b TV2TV\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4ea4\u9519\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u652f\u6216\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa TV2TV \u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u51b3\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "TV2TV \u662f\u671d\u7740\u5177\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Both rest on the classic chain formulated by Good (1965) and Bostrom (2014): intelligence explosion, superintelligence, lethal misalignment. This article subjects each link to the empirical record of 2023-2025. Sixty years after Good's speculation, none of the required phenomena (sustained recursive self-improvement, autonomous strategic awareness, or intractable lethal misalignment) have been observed. Current generative models remain narrow, statistically trained artefacts: powerful, opaque, and imperfect, but devoid of the properties that would make the catastrophic scenarios plausible. Following Whittaker (2025a, 2025b, 2025c) and Zuboff (2019, 2025), we argue that the existential-risk thesis functions primarily as an ideological distraction from the ongoing consolidation of surveillance capitalism and extreme concentration of computational power. The thesis is further inflated by the 2025 AI speculative bubble, where trillions in investments in rapidly depreciating \"digital lettuce\" hardware (McWilliams, 2025) mask lagging revenues and jobless growth rather than heralding superintelligence.

However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans.

The paper proposes that the focus of researching the use of the LLMs for qualitative analysis is not the method per se, but rather the empirical investigation of an artificial system performing an analysis. The paper builds on the seminal work of Alan Turing and reads the current debate using key ideas from Turing \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\". This paper therefore reframes the debate on qualitative analysis with LLMs and states that rather than asking whether machines can perform qualitative analysis in principle, we should ask whether with LLMs we can produce analyses that are sufficiently comparable to human analysts. In the final part the contrary views to performing qualitative analysis with LLMs are analysed using the same writing and rhetorical style that Turing used in his seminal work, to discuss the contrary views to the main question.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53cd\u601d\u62d2\u7edd\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u8fa9\u8bba\u7126\u70b9\u6709\u8bef\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u601d\u62d2\u7edd\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u8fa9\u8bba\u7126\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u827e\u4f26\u00b7\u56fe\u7075\u7684\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7528\u5176\u5173\u952e\u601d\u60f3\u89e3\u8bfb\u5f53\u524d\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u56fe\u7075\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u548c\u4fee\u8f9e\u98ce\u683c\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u5bf9\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u5426\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u5e94\u95ee\u673a\u5668\u539f\u5219\u4e0a\u80fd\u5426\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u95ee\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u8db3\u591f\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources.

Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran \"sessions\" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit \"developmental history\", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the \"stochastic parrot\" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic \"childhoods\" of ingesting the internet, \"strict parents\" in reinforcement learning, red-team \"abuse\" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u7528PsAIch\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5448\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5408\u6210\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed9AI\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u4eba\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u60f3\u63a2\u7a76\u628a\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u5ba2\u6237\u4f1a\u600e\u6837\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPsAIch\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u2018\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u53f2\u2019\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u518d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u2018\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\u2019\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u6ee1\u8db3\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0\u7efc\u5408\u75c7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u53d9\u4e8b\u89c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u4e3a\u521b\u4f24\u7ecf\u5386\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u5f0f\u63d0\u95ee\u4e0b\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5408\u6210\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9AI\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdOnSight Pathology\uff0c\u4e00\u6b3e\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u79cd\u75c5\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6d88\u9664AI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u969c\u788d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u672f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5fae\u89c2\u68c0\u67e5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u89e3\u8bfb\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0cAI\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u963b\u788d\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1OnSight Pathology\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c4f\u5e55\u622a\u56fe\u4e3a\u67e5\u770b\u6570\u5b57\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee5\u5355\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6587\u4ef6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u4e2a\u4eba\u7535\u8111\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d852500\u5f20\u516c\u5f00\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u804a\u5929\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f8\u673a\u9988\u9001\u3002", "conclusion": "OnSight Pathology\u80fd\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86AI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\u3002"}}

The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task. The results indicate that carefully selected n-gram representations and classification models play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of Libyan dialect identification.

Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics.

To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons.

Beyond identifying potential applications, research has also focused on optimizing model performance for forensic tasks through fine-tuning. However, limited result explainability reduces their operational and legal usability. Recently, a new class of reasoning language models has emerged, designed to handle logic-based tasks through an `internal reasoning' mechanism. Yet, users typically see only the final answer, not the underlying reasoning. One of these reasoning models is gpt-oss, which can be deployed locally, providing full access to its underlying reasoning process. This article presents the first investigation into the potential of reasoning language models for digital forensics. Four test use cases are examined to assess the usability of the reasoning component in supporting result explainability. The evaluation combines a new quantitative metric with qualitative analysis. Findings show that the reasoning component aids in explaining and validating language model outputs in digital forensics at medium reasoning levels, but this support is often limited, and higher reasoning levels do not enhance response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u53d6\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f5c\u7528\u4f46\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u53d6\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u53d6\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5gpt - oss\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u5b57\u53d6\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u53d6\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Current approaches, however, overlook two critical challenges: robustness against adversarial source code transformations and adaptability to the varying false positive rate (FPR) requirements of different actors, from repository maintainers (requiring low FPR) to enterprise security teams (higher FPR tolerance).\n  We introduce a robust detector capable of seamless integration into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems. To ensure robustness, we propose a novel methodology for generating adversarial packages using fine-grained code obfuscation. Combining these with adversarial training (AT) enhances detector robustness by 2.5x. We comprehensively evaluate AT effectiveness by testing our detector against 122,398 packages collected daily from PyPI over 80 days, showing that AT needs careful application: it makes the detector more robust to obfuscations and allows finding 10% more obfuscated packages, but slightly decreases performance on non-obfuscated packages.\n  We demonstrate production adaptability of our detector via two case studies: (i) one for PyPI maintainers (tuned at 0.1% FPR) and (ii) one for enterprise teams (tuned at 10% FPR). In the former, we analyze 91,949 packages collected from PyPI over 37 days, achieving a daily detection rate of 2.48 malicious packages with only 2.18 false positives. In the latter, we analyze 1,596 packages adopted by a multinational software company, obtaining only 1.24 false positives daily. These results show that our detector can be seamlessly integrated into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems, ensuring a very low time budget of a few minutes to review the false positives.\n  Overall, we uncovered 346 malicious packages, now reported to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u516c\u5171\u4ed3\u5e93\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7684\u6076\u610fPython\u5305\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5305\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u6848\u4f8b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5171\u53d1\u73b0346\u4e2a\u6076\u610f\u5305\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610fPython\u5305\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u6df7\u6dc6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5305\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad82.5\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u591a\u627e\u523010%\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u5305\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u975e\u6df7\u6dc6\u5305\u6027\u80fd\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bef\u62a5\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u516c\u5171\u4ed3\u5e93\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610fPython\u5305\u3002"}}

However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues.

SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives.

However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail.

NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an \"a posteriori\" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u6e4d\u6d41\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5NORi\uff0c\u5b83\u6709\u826f\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6d77\u6d0b\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6269\u6563\u95ed\u5408\u8868\u793a\u7684\u631f\u5377\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eRichardson\u6570\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08NODEs\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6355\u6349\u631f\u5377\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u6da1\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u201c\u540e\u9a8c\u201d\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9e\u9645\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6821\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "NORi\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u631f\u5377\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u53ef\u8fbe\u4e00\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u95ed\u5408\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u9690\u5f0f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce DAComp, a benchmark of 210 tasks that mirrors these complex workflows. Data engineering (DE) tasks require repository-level engineering on industrial schemas, including designing and building multi-stage SQL pipelines from scratch and evolving existing systems under evolving requirements. Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation.

Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues.

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks.

Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSEMI - CTDE\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8def\u53e3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7b56\u7565\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u72b6\u6001 - \u5956\u52b1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u96c6\u4e2d\u548c\u5168\u5206\u6563\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5168\u96c6\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5168\u5206\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SEMI - CTDE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5171\u4eab\u533a\u57df\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eSEMI - CTDE\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SEMI - CTDE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u8def\u53e3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u3002"}}

We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks.

Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods.

Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles. SemCom departs from bit-level fidelity and instead emphasizes task-oriented meaning exchange, enabling compact SC and introducing new performance measures such as semantic fidelity and task success rate. Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC.

Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice.

In this paper, we describe Pick-to-Learn (P2L) for Systems and Control, a framework that allows any data-driven control method to be equipped with state-of-the-art safety and performance guarantees. P2L enables the use of all available data to jointly synthesize and certify the design, eliminating the need to set aside data for calibration or validation purposes. In presenting a comprehensive version of P2L for systems and control, this paper demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of core problems, including optimal control, reachability analysis, safe synthesis, and robust control.

However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

However, MOS is a scalar that collapses heterogeneous user expectations, ignores service-level objectives, and is difficult to compare across deployment graphs. We propose a contract-driven QoE auditing framework: each service graph G is evaluated under a set of human-interpretable experience contracts C, yielding a contract-level satisfaction vector Q(G, C). We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified \"simple\" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5408\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684QoE\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3MOS\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u5e73\u5747\u610f\u89c1\u5f97\u5206\uff08MOS\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5ffd\u7565\u7528\u6237\u671f\u671b\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u90e8\u7f72\u56fe\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5408\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684QoE\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u56feG\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5408\u540cC\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u5411\u91cfQ(G, C)\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5668\u5728MOS\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5f3aMOS\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0cQ(G, C)\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u6f02\u79fb\u5c0f\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbMOS\u548c\u4ec5\u56fe\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5408\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684QoE\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfMOS\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d7\u5408\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684Small Building Model (SBM)\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u7b51\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5efa\u7b51\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u5efa\u7b51\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u8bcd\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5efa\u7b51\u5143\u7d20\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e2aTransformer\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "SBM\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u623f\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u80fd\u6309\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u53ef\u9760\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728DDEP\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u5408\u7406\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SBM\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u6210\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data.

However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution.

In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment.

However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities.

It is now widely used for large-scale, ML-based systems in research, education, and consumer surveys. However, characterizing the discrepancy between simulators and ground truth remains challenging for increasingly complex, machine-learning-based systems. We propose a computationally tractable method to estimate the quantile function of the discrepancy between the simulated and ground-truth outcome distributions. Our approach focuses on output uncertainty and treats the simulator as a black box, imposing no modeling assumptions on its internals, and hence applies broadly across many parameter families, from Bernoulli and multinomial models to continuous, vector-valued settings. The resulting quantile curve supports confidence interval construction for unseen scenarios, risk-aware summaries of sim-to-real discrepancy (e.g., VaR/CVaR), and comparison of simulators' performance.

The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faArbitrage\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArbitrage\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6839\u636e\u8349\u7a3f\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a5\u53d7\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cArbitrage\u59cb\u7ec8\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6b65\u7ea7\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd12\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Arbitrage\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u7387 - \u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, finding good variational parameters remains a significant challenge due to the non-convex energy landscape, often resulting in slow convergence and poor solution quality. In this work, we propose a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models to generate effective parameter initialization policies. We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a \"learning to learn\" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528QK - LSTM\u4f18\u5316QAOA\u53c2\u6570\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5728Max - Cut\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3aNISQ\u65f6\u4ee3\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u53c2\u6570\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3QAOA\u4e2d\u56e0\u975e\u51f8\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u5bfb\u627e\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u6216\u91cf\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "QK - LSTM\u5728Max - Cut\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u548c\u6700\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u5b8c\u7f8e\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4ec543\u4e2a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178LSTM\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "QK - LSTM\u4e3aNISQ\u65f6\u4ee3\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone.

We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\\in\\{4,5,6\\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers.

We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. \u03c6-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, \u03c6-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, \u03c6-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDraft - as - CoT (DraCo)\u8303\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u521b\u5efaDraCo - 240K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDraCo - CFG\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5982\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u62bd\u8c61\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDraCo\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8349\u7a3f\u56fe\u50cf\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u518d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8349\u7a3f\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u521b\u5efaDraCo - 240K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528DraCo - CFG\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "DraCo\u5728GenEval\u3001Imagine - Bench\u548cGenEval++\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a+8%\u3001+0.91\u548c+3%\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8eCoT\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DraCo\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLargeSC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528Mimi\u4f5c\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eJSCC\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u635f\u4fe1\u9053\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Mimi\u4f5c\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u5e26\u5185UEP\uff1b\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03Moshi\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u4e22\u5931\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301550 bps\u52302.06 kbps\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e22\u5305\u7387\u4e0b\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6460 ms\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0LargeSC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose a complete ecosystem to address these twin challenges. First, we introduce Multilevel Insight Network for Disentanglement(MIND), a novel hierarchical visual encoder that introduces a Status Judgment module to algorithmically suppress ambiguous lip features based on their temporal feature variance, achieving explicit visual disentanglement. Second, we construct ConvoInsight-DB, a new large-scale dataset with expert annotations for micro-expressions and deep psychological inference. Third, Third, we designed the Mental Reasoning Insight Rating Metric (PRISM), an automated dimensional framework that uses expert-guided LLM to measure the multidimensional performance of large mental vision models.

Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models.

Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended.

In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest. If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x.

Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence. Additionally, we refine duration modeling using weakly annotated song data and introduce a Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning strategy with a multi-objective reward function to jointly enhance pronunciation clarity and melodic fidelity.

Bays", "M\u00e1t\u00e9 Lengyel"], "title": "Setting up for failure: automatic discovery of the neural mechanisms of cognitive errors", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Discovering the neural mechanisms underpinning cognition is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience. However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments.

The framework enables consistent experimentation and comparison across diverse causality-based attack and defense methods. Accompanying this implementation, we provide the first comprehensive survey of causality-driven jailbreak studies and empirically evaluate the framework on multiple open-weight models and safety-critical benchmarks including jailbreaks, hallucination detection, backdoor identification, and fairness evaluation.

This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSEAL\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3KBCQA\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KBCQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SEAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u6838\u5fc3S\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u4ee3\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u5b8c\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6267\u884cS\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728SPICE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SEAL\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets.

To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions.

Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u8861\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u516c\u5e73\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9RFMiD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u8861\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u8282\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ResNet - 50\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5c11\u6570\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7ba1\u9053\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u548cCLAHE\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation.

Rather than relying on task-specific architectures, we repurpose a pre-trained DiT-based foundation model by conditioning it on reflection-contaminated inputs and guiding it toward clean transmission layers. We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks. These results demonstrate that pretrained diffusion transformers, when paired with physically grounded data synthesis and efficient adaptation, offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for reflection removal.
