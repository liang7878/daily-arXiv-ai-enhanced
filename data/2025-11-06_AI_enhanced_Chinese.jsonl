Croatia provides a unique setting for\nevaluating post-disaster recovery in countries recently incorporated into the\nEuropean Union. Our benchmark projections, which assume moderate economic\ngrowth and a broadly neutral fiscal stance, suggest the debt-to-GDP ratio will\ngradually decline to below 55% by 2040.

Deterministic and stochastic simulations\nallow us to assess the distribution of potential outcomes. It is shown that, in\nthe absence of shocks, public debt is on a sustainable downward path, but a\nsevere natural disaster could reverse this trend and keep it elevated for\nyears. Our findings highlight the importance of fiscal buffers that are\ncritical for creating space to absorb shocks.

However, these contests do not reflect\nthe depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new\nbenchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced\nmathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each\nwith 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a\ndifficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD\nqualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both\nPhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our\nevaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a\nstark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%\n(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals\nthat models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their\nability to formalize this reasoning.

We introduce a scalable latent diffusion model\nfor single-cell gene expression data, which we refer to as scLDM, that respects\nthe fundamental exchangeability property of the data. Our VAE uses fixed-size\nlatent variables leveraging a unified Multi-head Cross-Attention Block (MCAB)\narchitecture, which serves dual roles: permutation-invariant pooling in the\nencoder and permutation-equivariant unpooling in the decoder. We enhance this\nframework by replacing the Gaussian prior with a latent diffusion model using\nDiffusion Transformers and linear interpolants, enabling high-quality\ngeneration with multi-conditional classifier-free guidance. We show its\nsuperior performance in a variety of experiments for both observational and\nperturbational single-cell data, as well as downstream tasks like cell-level\nclassification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bscLDM\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u5efa\u6a21\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u8c31\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165scLDM\uff0cVAE\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u548cMCAB\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528Diffusion Transformers\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u66ff\u6362\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u6027\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u7ec6\u80de\u6c34\u5e73\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "scLDM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

At first glance, this lower\nbound appears to rule out any algorithm more efficient than the naive approach\nof sorting $I$ and comparing adjacent elements. However, upon closer\ninspection, the $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ bound does not apply if the input has many\nduplicates. We therefore ask: Are there comparison-based lower bounds for\nelement distinctness that are sensitive to the amount of duplicates in the\ninput?\n  To address this question, we derive instance-specific lower bounds.

Large language models show promise for\nindividual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental\nlimitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning\npatterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation.

We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that\nintegrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to\nconstruct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent\narchitectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent\nconnectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel\ntransformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed\nphase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides\na principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed\ncoordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the\nreservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters\nsuch as spectral radius and leaking rate.

Clustering similarity measures are typically\norganized into two principal families, pair-counting and information-theoretic,\nreflecting whether they quantify agreement through element pairs or aggregate\ninformation across full cluster contingency tables. Prior work has uncovered\nparallels between these families and applied empirical normalization or\nchance-correction schemes, but their deeper analytical connection remains only\npartially understood. Here, we develop an analytical framework that unifies\nthese families through two complementary perspectives. First, both families are\nexpressed as weighted expansions of observed versus expected co-occurrences,\nwith pair-counting arising as a quadratic, low-order approximation and\ninformation-theoretic measures as higher-order, frequency-weighted extensions.\nSecond, we generalize pair-counting to $k$-tuple agreement and show that\ninformation-theoretic measures can be viewed as systematically accumulating\nhigher-order co-assignment structure beyond the pairwise level. We illustrate\nthe approaches analytically for the Rand index and Mutual Information, and show\nhow other indices in each family emerge as natural extensions. Together, these\nviews clarify when and why the two regimes diverge, relating their\nsensitivities directly to weighting and approximation order, and provide a\nprincipled basis for selecting, interpreting, and extending clustering\nsimilarity measures across applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4e24\u5927\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u8054\u7cfb\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u660e\u6670\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u5c06\u4e24\u5927\u5bb6\u65cf\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u5171\u73b0\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u5c06\u6210\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230k\u5143\u7ec4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u5170\u5fb7\u6307\u6570\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5404\u5bb6\u65cf\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9610\u660e\u4e24\u5927\u5bb6\u65cf\u5dee\u5f02\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Solving an optimization problem $P$ via QA\ninvolves a hardware-aware circuit compilation which requires representing $P$\nas a graph $G_P$ and embedding it into the hardware connectivity graph $G_Q$\nthat defines how qubits connect to each other in a QA-based quantum processing\nunit (QPU).\n  Minor Embedding (ME) is a possible operational form of this hardware-aware\ncompilation. ME heuristically builds a map that associates each node of $G_P$\n-- the logical variables of $P$ -- to a chain of adjacent nodes in $G_Q$ by\nmeans of one of its minors, so that the arcs of $G_P$ are preserved as physical\nconnections among qubits in $G_Q$.\n  The static topology of hardwired qubits can clearly lead to inefficient\ncompilations because $G_Q$ cannot be a clique, currently. We propose a\nmethodology and a set of criteria to evaluate how the hardware topology $G_Q$\ncan negatively affect the embedded problem, thus making the quantum\noptimization more sensible to noise.\n  We evaluate the result of ME across two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs (used\nin current D-Wave systems) and Havel-Hakimi graphs, which allow controlled\nvariation of the average node degree. This enables us to study how the ratio\n`number of nodes/number of incident arcs per node' affects ME success rates to\nmap $G_P$ into a minor of $G_Q$.\n  Our findings, obtained through ME executed on classical, i.e. non-quantum,\narchitectures, suggest that Havel-Hakimi-based topologies, on average, require\nshorter qubit chains in the minor of $G_P$, exhibiting smoother scaling of the\nlargest embeddable $G_P$ as the QPU size increases.

Specifically, a model was\npre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on\n4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model\nwas then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to\nreach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such\npost-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model,\nnot LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u9012\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u5185\u5bf9\u7ade\u8d5b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u6210\u7ee9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5TRM\u867d\u5728ARC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u8fdc\u8d85\u7ade\u8d5b\u5141\u8bb8\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9700\u627e\u5230\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u5185\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5728\u516c\u5171ARC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u9012\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5148\u57284\u5757H100 SXM GPU\u4e0a\u75281280\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c700k+\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u65f6\u957f48\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c12500\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516c\u5171\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u7ea610%\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u534a\u79c1\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5f97\u52066.67%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5fae\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u800c\u975eLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u5185\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This noise generator \"steals\" compute resources to\ndegrade performance measurements.\n  All experiments showed different latency distributions while under the\neffects of noise generation, but results show that process isolation generally\nlowered false positives, except for our experiments with Docker containers.\nEven though Docker containers rely internally on cgroups and CPU pinning, they\nwere more susceptible to performance degradation due to noise influence.\nTherefore, we recommend to use process isolation for synchronized workloads,\nwith the exception of Docker containers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d7\u591a\u79df\u6237\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cDuet\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u9700\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9664Docker\u5bb9\u5668\u5916\uff0c\u8fdb\u7a0b\u9694\u79bb\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u56e0\u591a\u79df\u6237\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30cgroups\u548cCPU pinning\u3001Docker\u5bb9\u5668\u3001Firecracker MicroVMs\u4e09\u79cd\u9694\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e0e\u65e0\u9694\u79bb\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5404\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9664Docker\u5bb9\u5668\u5916\uff0c\u8fdb\u7a0b\u9694\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0cDocker\u5bb9\u5668\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u540c\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u7a0b\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528Docker\u5bb9\u5668\u3002"}}

For other programs, e.g.,\nsemidefinite ones, examples due to Khachiyan show that optimal solutions may\nrequire huge coefficients with an exponential number of bits, even if we allow\napproximations. Correspondingly, semidefinite programming is not even known to\nbe in NP. The unconstrained minimization of convex polynomials of degree four\nand higher has remained a fundamental open problem between these two extremes:\nits optimal solutions do not admit a linear characterization and, at the same\ntime, Khachiyan-type examples do not apply. We resolve this problem by\ndeveloping new techniques to prove solution bounds when no linear\ncharacterizations are available. Even for programs minimizing a convex\npolynomial (of arbitrary degree) over a polyhedron, we prove that the existence\nof an optimal solution implies that an approximately optimal one with\npolynomial bit length also exists. These solution bounds, combined with the\nellipsoid method, yield the first polynomial-time algorithm for convex\npolynomial programming, settling a question posed by Nesterov (Math.

This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,\nour framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with\nstatistical validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9ROGUE\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ROGUE - TS\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u6982\u7387\u88c1\u526a\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aMRT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728ROGUE\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8c03\u5229\u7528\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u603b\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728MRTs\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1ROGUE - TS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u88c1\u526a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u603b\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aMRT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9057\u61be\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u4e14\u4e0d\u8fc7\u591a\u589e\u52a0\u9057\u61be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1MRTs\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Over the last\n20 years, the most celebrated positive results of the field have been linear\nkernels for classical NP-hard graph problems on sparse graph classes.

We provide the following\ndynamic version of their kernel: Our data structure is initialized with an\n$n$-vertex planar graph $G$ in $O(n \\log n)$ amortized time, and, at\ninitialization, outputs a planar graph $K$ with $\\mathrm{OPT}(K) =\n\\mathrm{OPT}(G)$ and $|K| = O(\\mathrm{OPT}(G))$, where $\\mathrm{OPT}(\\cdot)$\ndenotes the size of a minimum dominating set. The graph $G$ can be updated by\ninsertions and deletions of edges and isolated vertices in $O(\\log n)$\namortized time per update, under the promise that it remains planar. After each\nupdate to $G$, the data structure outputs $O(1)$ updates to $K$, maintaining\n$\\mathrm{OPT}(K) = \\mathrm{OPT}(G)$, $|K| = O(\\mathrm{OPT}(G))$, and planarity\nof $K$.\n  Furthermore, we obtain similar dynamic kernelization algorithms for all\nproblems satisfying certain conditions on (topological-)minor-free graph\nclasses.

The\nresearch builds upon a previous matrix interpolation method applied on top of a\nCraig-Bampton modal reduction, allowing the variations of geometrical features\nwithout the need to remesh and recompute Finite Element matrices. This existing\nprocedure has significant limitations since it requires a common modal\nprojection, which inherently restricts the allowable perturbation size of the\nmodel parameters, thereby limiting the model parameter space where matrices can\nbe effectively interpolated. The present work offers three contributions: (1)\nIt provides structural dynamic insight into the restrictions imposed by the\ncommon modal projection, demonstrating that ill-conditioning can be controlled,\n(2) it proposes an efficient, sampling-based procedure to identify the\nnon-regular boundaries of the usable region in the model parameter space, and\n(3) it enhances the surrogate model to accommodate larger model parameter\nperturbations by proposing a multi-region interpolation strategy.

To address this issue, one approach is to enumerate\n$\\ell$-isolated maximal cliques, whose vertices have (on average) less than\n$\\ell$ edges toward the rest of the graph. By tuning parameter $\\ell$, the\ndegree of isolation can be controlled, and cliques that are overly connected to\nthe outside are filtered out.

However, designing heterogeneous\nmetamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and\nstrict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional\nconcurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization\nproblem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell\nboundaries.

In this work, we\npropose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a\ncontinuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly\naddressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural\nrepresentation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and\nlocal (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that\nrepresents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across\nthe domain, without the need for a predefined dataset.

Experiments were\ncarried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under\nboth irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under\ninvestigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses\ndue to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven\nreduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring\nloads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of\nvessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware\ncharacterization of the model response by accounting for variability in\nhyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated\nthat both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular\nand irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based\nROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification,\ndemonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea\ncondition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in\nreproducing vessel dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528HDMDc\u548cBHDMDc\u5bf9\u7cfb\u6cca\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5c0f\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u9762\u822a\u884c\u5668\uff08ASV\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9884\u6d4bASV\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6ce2\u6d6a\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0cHDMDc\u57fa\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u6cca\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5c0f\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u9762\u822a\u884c\u5668\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u51f9\u9677\u6708\u6c60\u7684ASV\u56e0\u6643\u8361\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Hankel\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff08HDMDc\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\uff08BHDMDc\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8239\u8236\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7cfb\u6cca\u8f7d\u8377\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "HDMDc\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u8239\u8236\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u516c\u5f0f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u8239\u8236\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6ce2\u6d6a\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eHDMDc\u7684\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6d77\u51b5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u518d\u73b0\u8239\u8236\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002"}}

Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional\nLLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code\nquality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for\nspecific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving\ncontexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and\nexecuting workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based\nagents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce\nRefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software\nrefactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and\nthe search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a\nmedian F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent\napproaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the\nmedian compilation success rate by 40.1%.

For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties.

Retraining LLMs from scratch to\nreflect such changes is computationally expensive, making model editing a\npromising lightweight alternative that updates only a small subset of\nparameters. Despite its potential, it remains unclear whether model editing\nyields genuine syntactic and semantic adaptations or merely superficial fixes.\nIn this work, we present a systematic study of five state-of-the-art model\nediting methods: Constrained Fine-Tuning (FT), GRACE, MEMIT, PMET, and ROME. We\napply these methods to three leading open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama,\nCodeQwen1.5, and DeepSeek-Coder, under controlled API deprecation scenarios.\nOur evaluation covers both instant and sequential editing settings, using three\ndisjoint evaluation sets designed to assess reliability, generalization, and\nspecificity. We measure model correctness at three levels: successful\ncompilation, partial test case pass, and full test pass.

It\nis essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various\ninformation from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to\nappropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a\njoint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the\nKronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities\nand indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the\njoint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is\nunderexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the\ninteractions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution\nand marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel\ncopula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the\njoint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions\namong them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align\nthe marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a\nGaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint\ndistribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing\nmodalities.

U2F consists of two\nkey components: (1) a Discovery-Exploration-Integration agent system for\nuncovering and synthesizing potential solutions, and (2) cognitive enhancement\nmechanisms across three dimensions: cross-domain analogical reasoning, reverse\nthinking, and external validation, which strategically reframe and extend\nconventional solution boundaries.\n  Applied to 218 real-world software enabler stories curated from authentic\nengineering tasks, U2F achieved notable improvements: human experts reported a\n14 percent increase in overall novelty, 51 percent improvement in semantic\nnovelty, and stable feasibility (4.02/5.0), corroborated by an LLM-based\nevaluator.

However, such systems are\nvulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where\nbots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning\nprocess and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust\nalgorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our\nknowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.\nThis estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no\ncost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out\noutliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.\nUpdating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence\nin experiments.

We show that the optimal regret inflation grows polynomial with the\nhorizon $T$, with exponent precisely given by the value of a convex\noptimization problem involving the dimension, smoothness, and batch budget.\nMoreover, the minimizers of this optimization problem directly prescribe the\nbatch allocation and exploration strategy of a rate-optimal algorithm.

This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small.

Recent test-time adaptation methods based on\nbatch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but\nthey often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained\nto specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration\n(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation\ndistributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the\nfull shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures\nemploying BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of\nestimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a\nrobust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our\nmethod leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling\nunsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,\nCIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR\nachieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing\ntest-time adaptation baselines.

However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key\nidea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,\nthereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations.

To systematically overcome this\nlimitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous\nelectrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from\narbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net\noperates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as\nlong-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and\nsuboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an\nenhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports\narbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG\ndevices, and compensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode\nplacement.

NABench aggregates 162 high-throughput assays\nand curates 2.6 million mutated sequences spanning diverse DNA and RNA\nfamilies, with standardized splits and rich metadata. We show that NABench\nsurpasses prior nucleotide fitness benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data\nquality. Under a unified evaluation suite, we rigorously assess 29\nrepresentative foundation models across zero-shot, few-shot prediction,\ntransfer learning, and supervised settings. The results quantify performance\nheterogeneity across tasks and nucleic-acid types, demonstrating clear\nstrengths and failure modes for different modeling choices and establishing\nstrong, reproducible baselines. We release NABench to advance nucleic acid\nmodeling, supporting downstream applications in RNA/DNA design, synthetic\nbiology, and biochemistry.

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives.

The best\nperforming model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and\nHelene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.\nThis work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage\nassessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML\nresearch and user communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08sUAS\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684AI/ML\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u98d3\u98ce\u707e\u5bb3\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2dsUAS\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u65e0\u57fa\u4e8esUAS\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8esUAS\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5927\u7684\u707e\u540esUAS\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf991\u540d\u707e\u5bb3\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u57f9\u8bad\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u6b21\u98d3\u98ce\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7ea618\u5206\u949f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86415\u5ea7\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u4e2dAI/ML\u7528\u4e8e\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6559\u8bad\u3002"}}

This limits autonomy and environmental\nawareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency.

It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u4ee3\u7406AI\u6846\u67b6AnaFlow\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7535\u8def\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7535\u8def\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u62df/\u6df7\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u4e3a\u624b\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5468\u671f\u957f\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u6280\u672f\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8017\u65f6\u4eff\u771f\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4eff\u771f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "AnaFlow\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7535\u8def\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f00\u521b\u6a21\u62dfEDA\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This study characterises the\nAS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls.\nUsing a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via\nspectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation\nby gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We\nfound that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced\nfunctional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally\ncohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time\nconstant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation,\nwe used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) trained on working memory tasks.

While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u6e90\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u7684\u601d\u8def\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5f55\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u6b65\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u6210\u6e90\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e20%\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5f55\u6bd4\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u8ba9\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u6807\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization.

Using the Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, the study\napplies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting and significance testing, including\na Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2579981.5, p = 0.0121), which confirmed that holiday\nshopping events experienced significantly more severe cyberattacks than\nnon-holiday periods. ANOVA was also used to examine seasonal variation in\nthreat severity, while ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and\nCatBoost) were employed for predictive classification. Results reveal recurrent\nattack spikes during high-risk periods such as Black Friday and holiday\nseasons, with breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII)\nexhibiting elevated threat indicators. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the\nhighest performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1 score = 0.2254, ROC AUC = 0.8247).\nThe framework uniquely combines seasonal forecasting with interpretable\nensemble learning, enabling temporal risk anticipation and breach-type\nclassification.

Schizophrenia, a complex disorder with diverse\nsymptoms including disorganized speech and social withdrawal, demands tools\nthat capture symptom severity and provide clinically meaningful insights beyond\nbinary diagnosis. Here, we present an interpretable framework that leverages\narticulatory speech features through eigenspectra difference plots and a\nweighted sum with exponential decay (WSED) to quantify vocal tract\ncoordination.

FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten\n(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating\nfull-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,\nFlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:\nstrong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail\nrecovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss\nthat assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively\ndecay it to permit fine-scale refinement.

Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains\ndifficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the\nneed for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy.

The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks.

Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling.

Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards.

Traditional\nbeamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under\nadverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an\nalternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to\nbeamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel\nenvironments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their\nability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency.

In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware\nSparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that\nincorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user\nsingle-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting.

Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel\nconditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a\nfixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional\nbeamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios,\nwhile maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys\nper query.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff08Doppler - aware Sparse NNBF\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6216\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDoppler - aware Sparse NNBF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08MU - SIMO\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u9053\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u4fe1\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u65f6\u9891\u8f74\u4e0a\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u5b8f\uff08UMa\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDoppler - aware Sparse NNBF\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u3002", "conclusion": "Doppler - aware Sparse NNBF\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u5173\u6ce8\u952e\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target.
