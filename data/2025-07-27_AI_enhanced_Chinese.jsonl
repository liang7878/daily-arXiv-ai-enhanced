Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is\ncomplex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon\nthe authors' previously established functional and informational requirements\nsupporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:\ntransferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset\ntransfer, the significance of \"sim-to-real transfer\" and \"real-to-sim\ntransfer\"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world\noperations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key\nchallenge in this process is calibrating the \"reality gap,\" the discrepancy\nbetween simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates\nthe impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an\nexisting DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim\ntransfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the\nRGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the\nhistorical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian\nbridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different\nlevels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full\nimplementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is\ncapable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world\noperations without compromising efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4ece\u5b66\u672f\u5230\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e2d\u2018\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210RGA\u6a21\u5757\u7ba1\u7406\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4ece\u5b66\u672f\u5230\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u6e21\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u800c\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u8d44\u4ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u2018\u6a21\u62df - \u73b0\u5b9e\u2019\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u2018\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u5355\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u5206\u6790\uff08RGA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u8fde\u63a5RGA\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5361\u5185\u57fa\u6885\u9686\u5927\u5b66\u4eba\u884c\u6865\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6574\u5b9e\u65bdRGA\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u64cd\u4f5c\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210RGA\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002"}}

Building on this finding, this paper not\nonly thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel\nflow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in\nthe gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical\nnumerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient\nconsistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background\npressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To\ncomprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its\npotential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical\nexperiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the\nresidue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven\nfree-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid\nstanding wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the\npressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length,\nresolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient\ncorrection technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be\neffective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability\nis fundamentally limited.

To measure the protection of minorities, we\nintroduce the $\\ell$-mutual minority criterion, which requires that if a\nsufficiently large (parametrized by $\\ell$) coalition $T$ of voters ranks all\ncandidates in $S$ lower than all other candidates, then none of the candidates\nin $S$ should win. The highest $\\ell$ for which the criterion is satisfied\nprovides a well-defined measure of mutual minority protection (ranging from 1\nto $m$).\n  Our main contribution is the analysis of a recently proposed class of voting\nrules called $k$-Approval Veto, offering a comprehensive range of trade-offs\nbetween the two principles. This class spans between Plurality Veto (for $k=1$)\n- a simple voting rule achieving optimal metric distortion - and Vote By Veto\n(for $k=m$) which picks a candidate from the proportional veto core. We show\nthat $k$-Approval Veto has minority protection at least $k$, and thus, it\naccommodates any desired level of minority protection. However, this comes at\nthe price of lower social welfare.

Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles.

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

These applications have diverse token-generation latency\nrequirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet.

In contrast, R&D expenditure shows a consistent and\npositive association with firm performance. Through mechanism analysis, we\nexplore three channels (organizational environment, employee quality, and\npolicy-driven incentives) to explain the impact of R&D, identifying capital\ninflow and valuation as key drivers of R&D investment.

Unlike traditional\nShapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our\nGraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact\nof structural changes on GNN predictions.

Yet fundamental\nquestions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across\ndisciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves\ntogether functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent\nneuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we\nprove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together\nwith global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property\n(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate\nactivation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,\ncovering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a\nStone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with\npolynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of\ncausal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to\nstochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via\nmemory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute\ndelay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the\n\\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical\nsystems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive\nconditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical\ncriticality.

While canonical economic models assume\natomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive\nsingle-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of\nits environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a\nsearch-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL\nagent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify\na parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and\nRL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a\ncalibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a\nrepresentative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost\nfunction to reflect economic opportunity costs.

Furthermore, embedding constraints on the\nself-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the\nperformance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and\nattention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u5206\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5185\u90e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MLP\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53476\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on\nhighly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques\nare actively studied in the research community, the real-world model\ndevelopment still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled\naccess. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \\emph{not} to\nshare highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the\nuser to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,\nquantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to\nenabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a\nmembership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to\nmeasure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS\ninteraction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential\nprivacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical\ncomponent is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality\nmembership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known\nbenchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits\nof RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

This work has\n  been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing\neducators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering\nand computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,\nPjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical\nthinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,\nfaculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient\ninstitutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,\ndesigning or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This\nresearch explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources\nthat facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data\nfrom 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising\nclosed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,\nalong with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative\ndata were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses\nunderwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,\nits adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and\nmanaging the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of\ninstitutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy.

We present ASI-Arch,\nthe first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research\n(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully\nautonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to\nconduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring\nhuman-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization\nto automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in\nthe domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel\narchitectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and\nempirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and\npast experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000\nGPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) linear attention architectures.

We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements.

Therefore, many\ntechniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers.

To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques\nunconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers\nthat waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and\ngenerating false positive bug reports.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing\ntechnique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs\nto understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination\nconstraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling\nframework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz\ndrivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing\ncampaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,\nmultiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while\nsimultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or\nsuspension.\n  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries.

Our approach stresses the need for an analysis\nof AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and\nmulti-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we\nprovide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis.

Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without\nany specific selection.\n  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file\nlocalisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging\npractices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file\nlocalisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.\nFinally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases\nknown in the bug localisation community on our dataset.\n  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform\npoorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general\npurpose models.

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed\nto cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the\nenvironment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface\n(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.\n  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a\nSystem-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software\nfrom a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled.

It is, however, very challenging to\nachieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data\nefficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may\nrequire. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly\nadvancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel\nreception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a\ndifferent subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by\nenabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on\nthe same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.\nAdditionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data\nfrom the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data\nparallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold\ncode-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering\nwithin and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the\nset for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive\nconcurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve\napproximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection\nat the BS and energy efficient at the sensors.

We test the assumptions and predictions\nof SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating\nexcellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,\nwe show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by\nsimply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight\nmatrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the\nperformance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find\nthat they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u91caSOTA\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u534a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bbaSETOL\uff0c\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728MLP\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0HTSR alpha\u548cSETOL ERG\u6307\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91caSOTA\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u7406\u8bbaHTSR\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u91cf\u8d77\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u53553\u5c42MLP\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MLP\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7684ESD\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\uff1bHTSR alpha\u548cSETOL ERG\u6307\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "SETOL\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel\ndataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of\n0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and\nstatistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.\nFurthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,\nSIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with\ninjected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from\n0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,\nprivacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSIFOTL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u56e0\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u56e0\u7d20\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u89c4\u5219\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u8fc7\u7a0b\u566a\u97f3\u963b\u788d\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIFOTL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7528\u53ccXGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u79bb\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u52a0\u6743\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5408\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u79fb\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728MEPS\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c18\u4e2aEHR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSIFOTL\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eBigQuery\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SIFOTL\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6ce8\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u97f3\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Ultra low-bit quantization can\nsignificantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression\n(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To\naddress this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively \"squeezing\" 16-bit LLMs'\nweights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits\nper weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We\nintroduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation\nRobustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS).

This setting\nnaturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional\nsupervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to\nimproved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision\nas probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine\ncombination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through\ngeneralization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional\nsupervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and\nasymptotic value of the error bound.

However, their\nsusceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including\nvariations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and\nscanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first\nsystematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.\nOur work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates\nthe consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM\nrobustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,\na robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness\nindex, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical\ncenters. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated\nFMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that\nnon-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and\nclinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model\nhas good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the\nparsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces\nuser burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting\nmodel compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the\none-step-ahead prediction accuracy.

Against the backdrop of this challenge,\nthis study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT\nmodel to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The\nresults suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data\nis a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness\nbecomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is\ntrained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.\nNonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for\nemploying synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528GenAI\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u6210\u50cfGenAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9700\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GenAI LightningDiT\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u7528\u7684\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7840\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u6210\u50cfGenAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Accurate estimation of a State of Health\n(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability\nand safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,\ntransformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from\ndischarge cycle data.

The approach utilizes tabular\nQ-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state\nspace, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The\nframework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,\ndomain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with\ncustomizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures\nsuch as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse\nmatrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables\nscalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing\ncomputational overhead.

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities.

These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior.

Experimental results on\nTELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM\nachieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,\nand outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal\nvariation, and age-sensitive interactions.

Because soil N has\nhigh spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate\nthe N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the\nindividual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used\nin-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of\nfour different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over\ntwo growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N\nconcentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two\nfeature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral\nbands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral\nbands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,\nGradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The\ncomparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets\nshowed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection\nmethods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level\ndatasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,\nand 900-950nm.

However,\nthis reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject\npoisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process\ntoward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based\nMasked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter\nout adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact\ntokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function.

In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is\npresented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using\natomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a\nhigh-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,\nand symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to\nexpose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,\nunsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous\natoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with\nmultidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a\nminimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various\ntests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only\nthree order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.\nBased on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as\nthe logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal\nthroughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance\n(AUC).

The synergistic\nreasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation\nModels (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.\nNevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic\ngranularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,\n(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments.

Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world\nexperiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical\nlab environments.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most\nwidespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and\nremarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is\nrelatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA\nfine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).\nHowever, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more\ninformation leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we\nintroduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the\nfine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership\ninference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that\nleverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply\nLoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language\nprocessing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still\nvulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).\nWe also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the\nresulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only\ndropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively\nmitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the\n\"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model\nmakes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can\nprovide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoRA - Leak\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u4e14\u4eba\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5c0f\u800c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u514d\u75ab\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b15\u79cd\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684LoRA - Leak\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5982\u4fdd\u5b88\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0bAUC\u4e3a0.775\uff1b\u53ea\u6709dropout\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u6392\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u201c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 - \u5fae\u8c03\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks.

Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three\nhierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface\nto depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.\nVideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent\nexpressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and\nare not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated\nusing a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through\nstep-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,\nplace, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition\ntasks.

Thirdly, we design the\nBilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align\nluminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating\nartifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV\nachieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low\ncomputational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in\nlow-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization\ncapabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRWKV\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GER\u7406\u8bba\u3001Evolving WKV Attention\u548cBi - SAB\u4e0eMS2 - Loss\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u9886\u5148\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u7269\u4f53\u8fb9\u7f18\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDRWKV\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210Global Edge Retinex (GER)\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Evolving WKV Attention\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi - SAB)\u548cMS2 - Loss\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aLLIE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDRWKV\u5728PSNR\u3001SSIM\u548cNIQE\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5149\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DRWKV\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
