In particular, our focus is limited to softening elastic damage models using Lip-field regularization. The Lip-field approach is a new technique to introduce length scale into the softening damage models. It was first presented for the quasi-static case and then extended to a one-dimensional dynamic case. This paper extends the application of the Lip-field approach to dynamic fracture in two-dimensional cases. Lip-field approach is a variational approach, in which the potential to be minimized is a non-regularized one. A potential without regularization can result in spurious strain localization, but the Lip-field approach resolves this issue by imposing Lipschitz constraints on the damage field. Our focus is limited to utilizing an explicit staggered scheme to determine the displacement and damage fields. Numerical studies are conducted for two-dimensional cases to assess the dynamic behavior of the proposed model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u5e94\u53d8\u7387\u4e0b\u6750\u6599\u65ad\u88c2\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06Lip - field\u65b9\u6cd5\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u4e8c\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u65ad\u88c2\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u9519\u683c\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u5e94\u53d8\u7387\u4e0b\u6750\u6599\u4f53\u65ad\u88c2\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u5316\u635f\u4f24\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u5e94\u53d8\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Lip - field\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u8f6f\u5316\u635f\u4f24\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u65ad\u88c2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u9519\u683c\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u635f\u4f24\u573a\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

Traditional data systems designed for human analysis cycles become correctness bottlenecks under this operating regime. When multiple agents operate over shared resources, their actions interact before reconciliation is possible. Correctness guarantees that apply after the decision window therefore fail to prevent conflicts. We introduce the Decision Coherence Law: for agents that take irreversible actions whose effects interact, correctness requires that interacting decisions be evaluated against a coherent representation of reality at the moment they are made. We show that no existing system class satisfies this requirement and prove through the Composition Impossibility Theorem that independently advancing systems cannot be composed to provide Decision Coherence while preserving their native system classes. From this impossibility result, we derive Context Lake as a necessary system class with three requirements: (1) semantic operations as native capabilities, (2) transactional consistency over all decision-relevant state, and (3) operational envelopes bounding staleness and degradation under load. We formalize the architectural invariants, enforcement boundaries, and admissibility conditions required for correctness in collective agent systems.

While straightforward in perfect-information games where search starts from the current state, subgame solving in imperfect-information games must account for hidden states and uncertainty about the opponent's past strategy. Gadget games were developed to ensure that the improved subgame strategy is robust against any possible opponent's strategy in a zero-sum game. Gadget games typically contain infinitely many Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that while these equilibria are equivalent in the gadget game, they yield vastly different performance in the full game, even when facing a rational opponent. We propose gadget game sequential equilibria as the preferred solution concept. We introduce modifications to the sequence-form linear program and counterfactual regret minimization that converge to these refined solutions with only mild additional computational cost. Additionally, we provide several new insights into the surprising superiority of the resolving gadget game over the max-margin gadget game. Our experiments compare different Nash equilibria of gadget games in several standard benchmark games, showing that our refined equilibria consistently outperform unrefined Nash equilibria, and can reduce the exploitability of the overall strategy by more than 50%", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\u535a\u5f08\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5747\u8861\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u9009\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u5265\u524a\u6027\u8d8550%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u5b50\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u9700\u8003\u8651\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5bf9\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\u535a\u5f08\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u5e8f\u5217\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u540e\u6094\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u5265\u524a\u6027\u8d8550%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\u535a\u5f08\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5747\u8861\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Five MOGA variants were implemented and compared: the Pareto genetic algorithm (PGA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with niching (NSGA-I), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with elitism (NSGA-II), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm using reference points (NSGA-III), and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA). These algorithms are employed to design and optimize microstrip patch antennas loaded with complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs). A weighted-sum scalarization approach was adopted within a single-objective genetic algorithm framework enhanced with domain-specific constraint handling mechanisms. The optimization addresses the conflicting objectives of minimizing the return loss ($S_{11} < -10$~dB) and achieving multi-band resonance at 2.4~GHz, 3.6~GHz, and 5.2~GHz. The proposed method delivers a superior overall performance by aggregating these objectives into a unified fitness function encompassing $S_{11}$(2.4~GHz), $S_{11}$(3.6~GHz), and $S_{11}$(5.2~GHz). This approach effectively balances all three frequency bands simultaneously, rather than exploring trade-off solutions typical of traditional multi-objective approaches. The antenna was printed on a Rogers RT5880 substrate with a dielectric constant of 2.2 , loss tangent of 0.0009 , and thickness of 1.57~mm . Scalarization approach achieved return loss values of $-21.56$~dB, $-16.60$~dB, and $-27.69$~dB, with corresponding gains of 1.96~dBi, 2.6~dB, and 3.99~dBi at 2.4~GHz, 3.6~GHz, and 5.2~GHz, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5929\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e94\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6c42\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u5e26\u8d34\u7247\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9891\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9891\u6bb5\u9891\u7387\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e94\u79cd\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6c42\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5c06\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5929\u7ebf\u57282.4GHz\u30013.6GHz\u548c5.2GHz\u7684\u56de\u6ce2\u635f\u8017\u5206\u522b\u4e3a -21.56dB\u3001 -16.60dB\u3001 -27.69dB\uff0c\u589e\u76ca\u5206\u522b\u4e3a1.96dBi\u30012.6dB\u30013.99dBi\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e09\u4e2a\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Many amateur and professional photographers like to use drones for aerial photography. Drones play a non-negligible role in agriculture and transportation too. Drones can be used to spray pesticides, and they can also transport supplies. A quadcopter is a four-rotor drone and has been studied in this paper. In this paper, random noise is added to the quadcopter system and its effects on the drone system are studied. An extended Kalman filter has been used to estimate the state based on noisy observations from the sensor. Based on a SDE system, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller has been implemented.

Proper order graphs are multi-column structures where vertices are arranged in parallel columns, with each vertex connected to consecutive vertices in adjacent columns. This graph structure naturally arises in surface extraction problems for geological horizon segmentation in seismic imaging volumes. We develop two parallel approaches: a hierarchical merging variant of the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm, and a novel parallel push-relabel algorithm with level synchronized global relabeling. Our primary contribution is the push-relabel variant, which partitions the graph into segments along columns with processor affinity, eliminating the need for a global shared queue. We introduce level synchronized global relabeling that enables concurrent label updates while maintaining correctness through barriers at each frontier level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u7ef4\u9002\u5f53\u987a\u5e8f\u56fe\u6700\u5c0fs - t\u5272\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u63a8 - \u91cd\u8d34\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e09\u7ef4\u9002\u5f53\u987a\u5e8f\u56fe\u7684\u6700\u5c0fs - t\u5272\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Boykov - Kolmogorov\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u5e76\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u5e26\u7ea7\u522b\u540c\u6b65\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u8d34\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u63a8 - \u91cd\u8d34\u6807\u7b7e\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8 - \u91cd\u8d34\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u6309\u5217\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ea7\u522b\u540c\u6b65\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u8d34\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u7684\u6700\u5c0fs - t\u5272\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Static, one-model-fits-all inference strategies are often inefficient, as they do not exploit the diverse range of available models or adapt to varying query requirements.\n  This paper presents GreenServ, a dynamic, context-aware routing framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference accuracy and energy efficiency. GreenServ extracts lightweight contextual features from each query, including task type, semantic cluster, and text complexity, and routes queries to the most suitable model from a heterogeneous pool, based on observed accuracy and energy usage. We employ a multi-armed bandit approach to learn adaptive routing policies online. This approach operates under partial feedback, eliminates the need for extensive offline calibration, and streamlines the integration of new models into the inference pipeline.\n  We evaluated GreenServ across five benchmark tasks and a pool of 16 contemporary open-access LLMs. Experimental results show that GreenServ consistently outperforms static (single-model) and random baselines. In particular, compared to random routing, GreenServ achieved a 22% increase in accuracy while reducing cumulative energy consumption by 31%. Finally, we evaluated GreenServ with RouterBench, achieving an average accuracy of 71.7% with a peak accuracy of 75.7%.

However, it cannot handle non-linearly separable clusters. Kernel K-means addresses this limitation but requires a large kernel matrix, making it computationally and memory intensive. Prior work has accelerated Kernel K-means by formulating it using sparse linear algebra primitives and implementing it on a single GPU. However, that approach cannot run on datasets with more than approximately 80,000 samples due to limited GPU memory.\n  In this work, we address this issue by presenting a suite of distributed-memory parallel algorithms for large-scale Kernel K-means clustering on multi-GPU systems. Our approach maps the most computationally expensive components of Kernel K-means onto communication-efficient distributed linear algebra primitives uniquely tailored for Kernel K-means, enabling highly scalable implementations that efficiently cluster million-scale datasets. Central to our work is the design of partitioning schemes that enable communication-efficient composition of the linear algebra primitives that appear in Kernel K-means.\n  Our 1.5D algorithm consistently achieves the highest performance, enabling Kernel K-means to scale to data one to two orders of magnitude larger than previously practical. On 256 GPUs, it achieves a geometric mean weak scaling efficiency of $79.7\\%$ and a geometric mean strong scaling speedup of $4.2\\times$. Compared to our 1D algorithm, the 1.5D approach achieves up to a $3.6\\times$ speedup on 256 GPUs and reduces clustering time from over an hour to under two seconds relative to a single-GPU sliding window implementation.

These methods use specific infra-annual indicators as proxies for the variables being estimated. The specific case of the quarterly estimation of Compensation of employees presents several additional challenges. Firstly, the information provided by the sources, based on cash or legal-accrual data, is elaborated to define indicators which respect the accrual ESA 2010 principle as the annual estimates, based on more compliant data sources such as final budgets of public entities. Secondly, at a quarterly level the extraordinary events - such as the recording of delayed collective bargaining agreements which result in arrears - have a strong impact on quarterly indicators, whereas their effect is mitigated at annual level. To attribute these flows to the period when the work is performed, multi-source data harmonization techniques are employed. Thirdly, to accurately reflect intra-annual dynamics, information is collected for specific groups of GG entities (e.g., regions and provinces) and aggregated into ESA 2010 GG sub-sectors (Central Government, Local Government, Social Security Funds) leading to three specific estimates. To validate temporal disaggregation models and ensure methodological rigor and data quality, statistical tests are applied throughout the process. The results confirm the effectiveness of this methodology in providing accurate and timely quarterly estimates of Compensation of employees for the GG sector, thereby supporting reliable short-term economic analysis and policy making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u6309\u7167ESA 2010\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u5458\u5de5\u85aa\u916c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b63\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4f30\u7b97\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u9ad8\u9891\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u9700\u4e0e\u5e74\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u5458\u5de5\u85aa\u916c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b63\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u95f4\u63a5\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5e74\u5185\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u8fd0\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u534f\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u7279\u6b8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u6309\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ec4\u6536\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u6c47\u603b\u5230ESA 2010\u5b50\u90e8\u95e8\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u653f\u5e9c\u90e8\u95e8\u5458\u5de5\u85aa\u916c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u5b63\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002"}}

While deep learning offers a solution, current approaches typically fall into two extremes: explicit generative models that construct molecular graphs atom-by-atom, or joint contrastive models that learn cross-modal subspaces from scratch. We introduce SpecBridge, a novel implicit alignment framework that treats structure identification as a geometric alignment problem. SpecBridge fine-tunes a self-supervised spectral encoder (DreaMS) to project directly into the latent space of a frozen molecular foundation model (ChemBERTa), and then performs retrieval by cosine similarity to a fixed bank of precomputed molecular embeddings. Across MassSpecGym, Spectraverse, and MSnLib benchmarks, SpecBridge improves top-1 retrieval accuracy by roughly 20-25% relative to strong neural baselines, while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. These results suggest that aligning to frozen foundation models is a practical, stable alternative to designing new architectures from scratch.

Driven by (i) rising demands for application-ready data (e.g., for analytics, visualization, decision-making), (ii) increasingly powerful LLM techniques, and (iii) the emergence of infrastructures that facilitate flexible agent construction (e.g., using Databricks Unity Catalog), LLM-enhanced methods are rapidly becoming a transformative and potentially dominant paradigm for data preparation.\n  By investigating hundreds of recent literature works, this paper presents a systematic review of this evolving landscape, focusing on the use of LLM techniques to prepare data for diverse downstream tasks. First, we characterize the fundamental paradigm shift, from rule-based, model-specific pipelines to prompt-driven, context-aware, and agentic preparation workflows. Next, we introduce a task-centric taxonomy that organizes the field into three major tasks: data cleaning (e.g., standardization, error processing, imputation), data integration (e.g., entity matching, schema matching), and data enrichment (e.g., data annotation, profiling). For each task, we survey representative techniques, and highlight their respective strengths (e.g., improved generalization, semantic understanding) and limitations (e.g., the prohibitive cost of scaling LLMs, persistent hallucinations even in advanced agents, the mismatch between advanced methods and weak evaluation). Moreover, we analyze commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics (the empirical part). Finally, we discuss open research challenges and outline a forward-looking roadmap that emphasizes scalable LLM-data systems, principled designs for reliable agentic workflows, and robust evaluation protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\u3001LLM\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u767e\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u7406\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e09\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM - \u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u539f\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Preprint version of work submitted, accepted, and presented at IEEE URTC. Accepted and pending publication in IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has driven major advances in autonomous control. Still, standard Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents tend to rely on fixed learning rates and uniform update scaling, even as updates are modulated by temporal-difference (TD) error. This rigidity destabilizes convergence, especially in sparse-reward settings where feedback is infrequent. We introduce Deep Intrinsic Surprise-Regularized Control (DISRC), a biologically inspired augmentation to DQN that dynamically scales Q-updates based on latent-space surprise. DISRC encodes states via a LayerNorm-based encoder and computes a deviation-based surprise score relative to a moving latent setpoint. Each update is then scaled in proportion to both TD error and surprise intensity, promoting plasticity during early exploration and stability as familiarity increases. We evaluate DISRC on two sparse-reward MiniGrid environments, which included MiniGrid-DoorKey-8x8 and MiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1, under identical settings as a vanilla DQN baseline. In DoorKey, DISRC reached the first successful episode (reward > 0.8) 33% faster than the vanilla DQN baseline (79 vs. 118 episodes), with lower reward standard deviation (0.25 vs. 0.34) and higher reward area under the curve (AUC: 596.42 vs. 534.90). These metrics reflect faster, more consistent learning - critical for sparse, delayed reward settings. In LavaCrossing, DISRC achieved a higher final reward (0.95 vs. 0.93) and the highest AUC of all agents (957.04), though it converged more gradually. These preliminary results establish DISRC as a novel mechanism for regulating learning intensity in off-policy agents, improving both efficiency and stability in sparse-reward domains. By treating surprise as an intrinsic learning signal, DISRC enables agents to modulate updates based on expectation violations, enhancing decision quality when conventional value-based methods fall short.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5185\u5728\u60ca\u559c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff08DISRC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6DQN\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6DQN\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u66f4\u65b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DISRC\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u60ca\u559c\u52a8\u6001\u7f29\u653eQ\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eLayerNorm\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u60ca\u559c\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728MiniGrid-DoorKey-8x8\u548cMiniGrid-LavaCrossingS9N1\u4e2d\uff0cDISRC\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfDQN\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DISRC\u662f\u8c03\u8282\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u9886\u57df\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation.

Existing taint analysis tools are predominantly designed for single languages, requiring substantial engineering effort that scales with language diversity. While multi-language tools like CodeQL, Joern, and WALA attempt to address these challenges, they face limitations in intermediate representation design, analysis precision, and extensibility, which make them difficult to scale effectively for large-scale industrial applications at Ant Group. To bridge this gap, we present YASA (Yet Another Static Analyzer), a unified multi-language static taint analysis framework designed for industrial-scale deployment. Specifically, YASA introduces the Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST) that provides a unified abstraction for compatibility across diverse programming languages. Building on the UAST, YASA performs point-to analysis and taint propagation, leveraging a unified semantic model to manage language-agnostic constructs, while incorporating language-specific semantic models to handle other unique language features. When compared to 6 single- and 2 multi-language static analyzers on an industry-standard benchmark, YASA consistently outperformed all baselines across Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. In real-world deployment within Ant Group, YASA analyzed over 100 million lines of code across 7.3K internal applications. It identified 314 previously unknown taint paths, with 92 of them confirmed as 0-day vulnerabilities.

While this is a classical problem with a significant body of research on approximation algorithms over the past two decades, constant-factor performance guarantees are currently known only under very restrictive assumptions on the input distributions, even when all job weights are identical. This algorithmic difficulty is striking given the lack of corresponding complexity results: to date, it is conceivable that the problem could be solved optimally in polynomial time.\n  We address this gap with hardness results that demonstrate the problem's inherent intractability. For the special case of discrete two-point processing time distributions and unit weights, we prove that deciding whether there exists a scheduling policy with expected cost at most a given threshold is #P-hard.

Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\\times$ inference speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSALR\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b050%\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u63d0\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLoRA\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5f0a\u7aef", "method": "\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u526a\u679d\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u7528\u622a\u65adSVD\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f4d\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u7801+GEMM\u8bbe\u8ba1", "result": "SALR\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523050%\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5728GSM8K\u548cMMLU\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eLoRA\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u534a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53471.7\u500d", "conclusion": "SALR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387"}}

The high-score tail exhibits rare selectors, external-call opcode enrichment, and low signature density; a proxy indicator is enriched in the BSC high-score queue, enabling secondary triage. Cross-chain reuse analysis shows tail enrichment and directional diffusion, with traceable same-hash cases across chains.

In these environments, ETL pipelines must process large, distributed datasets while minimizing latency and transfer cost. Push down optimization, which executes transformation logic within database engines rather than within the ETL tool, has proven highly effective in single cloud systems. However, when applied across multiple clouds, it faces challenges related to data movement, heterogeneous SQL engines, orchestration complexity, and fragmented security controls. This paper examines the feasibility of push down optimization in multi cloud ETL pipelines and analyzes its benefits and limitations. It evaluates localized push down, hybrid models, and data federation techniques that reduce cross cloud traffic while improving performance.

The results from experiments and model estimation reveal four consistent patterns: (1) agents' weighting of priors and signals deviates from unity; (2) both household and firm CEO agents place substantially larger weights on individual signals compared to aggregate signals; (3) we identify a significant and negative interaction between concurrent signals, implying that the presence of multiple information sources diminishes the marginal weight assigned to each individual signal; and (4) expectation formation patterns differ significantly between household and firm CEO agents.

The market is modeled as an inflationary relational system without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through projection, implemented here via spectral embeddings of the graph Laplacian. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate, while the projected density defines liquidity profiles around the mid price. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis -- excluding intrinsic length scales beyond distance to the mid and finite visibility -- we show that projected supply and demand are constrained to gamma-like functional forms. In discrete data, this prediction translates into integrated-gamma cumulative profiles. We test these results using high-frequency Level~II data for several U.S. equities and find robust agreement across assets and intraday windows. Explicit comparison with alternative cumulative models using information criteria demonstrates a systematic preference for the integrated-gamma geometry. A minimal simulation of inflationary relational dynamics reproduces the same structure without invoking agent behavior or price formation mechanisms. These results indicate that key regularities of order-book liquidity reflect geometric constraints induced by observation rather than detailed microstructural dynamics.\n  Supplementary Material is available at the arXiv submission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91d1\u878d\u8ba2\u5355\u7c3f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u51fa\u4f9b\u5e94\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u5448\u7c7b\u4f3d\u9a6c\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8ba2\u5355\u7c3f\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u4f9b\u9700\u89c6\u4e3a\u6d8c\u73b0\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u91d1\u878d\u8ba2\u5355\u7c3f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e02\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u65e0\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u5750\u6807\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u5173\u7cfb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u4f9b\u9700\u5448\u7c7b\u4f3d\u9a6c\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u9ad8\u9891\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u79ef\u5206\u4f3d\u9a6c\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e5f\u91cd\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba2\u5355\u7c3f\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u5f8b\u53cd\u6620\u7684\u662f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

These video-native queries are bottlenecked by rendering, not the execution of the underlying queries. This rendering is currently performed using post-processing scripts that are often slow. This step poses a critical point of friction in interactive video data workloads: even short clips contain thousands of high-definition frames; conventional OpenCV/Python scripts must decode -> transform -> encode the entire data stream before a single pixel appears, leaving users waiting for many seconds, minutes, or hours.\n  To address these issues, we present Vidformer, a drop-in rendering accelerator for video-native querying which, (i) transparently lifts existing visualization code into a declarative representation, (ii) transparently optimizes and parallelizes rendering, and (iii) instantly serves videos through a Video on Demand protocol with just-in-time segment rendering. We demonstrate that Vidformer cuts full-render time by 2-3x across diverse annotation workloads, and, more critically, drops time-to-playback to 0.25-0.5s. This represents a 400x improvement that decouples clip length from first-frame playback latency, and unlocks the ability to perform interactive video-native querying with sub-second latencies. Furthermore, we show how our approach enables interactive video-native LLM-based conversational querying as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVidformer\u52a0\u901f\u89c6\u9891\u539f\u751f\u67e5\u8be2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u64ad\u653e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u539f\u751f\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u5904\u7406\u811a\u672c\u6162\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVidformer\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u70b9\u64ad\u534f\u8bae\u5373\u65f6\u5206\u6bb5\u6e32\u67d3\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "Vidformer\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u4f7f\u5168\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed2 - 3\u500d\uff0c\u64ad\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u81f30.25 - 0.5\u79d2\uff0c\u6709400\u500d\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Vidformer\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u526a\u8f91\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u9996\u5e27\u64ad\u653e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u79d2\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u539f\u751f\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u3002"}}

In contrast, we take an epistemic perspective and consider a framework where PB projects have different levels of underlying quality, indicating how well the project will take effect, which cannot be directly observed before implementation. Agents with noisy information cast votes to aggregate their information, and aim to elect a high-quality set of projects. We evaluate the performance of common PB rules by measuring the expected utility of their outcomes, compared to the optimal set of projects. We find that the quality of approximation improves as the range of project costs shrinks.

Symbolic systems offer reliability and interpretability but lack scalability, while neural networks provide learning capabilities but sacrifice transparency. Tensor Logic, proposed by Domingos, suggests that logical rules and Einstein summation are mathematically equivalent, offering a principled path toward unification. This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries. Third, we validate the Tensor Logic superposition construction on FB15k-237, a large-scale knowledge graph with 14,541 entities and 237 relations. Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9Tensor Logic\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e00\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5723\u7ecf\u65cf\u8c31\u56fe\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u95ed\u5305\uff1b\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5728FB15k - 237\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1Tensor Logic\u53e0\u52a0\u6784\u9020\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u65cf\u8c31\u56fe\u4f20\u9012\u95ed\u5305\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u91cf\u7956\u5148\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9aMRR\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "Tensor Logic\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Ombuki-Berman"], "title": "Split Algorithm in Linear Time for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery and Time Windows", "categories": ["cs.DS"], "comment": null, "summary": "For many kinds of vehicle routing problems (VRPs), a popular heuristic approach involves constructing a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution, referred to as a long tour, then partitioning segments of the solution into routes for different vehicles with respect to problem constraints. Previously, a Split algorithm with a worst-case runtime of $\u0398(n)$ was proposed for the capacitated VRP (CVRP) that finds the most cost-efficient partition of customers, given a long tour. This was an improvement over the previously fastest-known Split algorithm with a worst-case runtime of $\u0398(n^2)$ that was based on Bellman's shortest path algorithm. While this linear Split has been an integral part of modern state-of-the-art CVRP approaches, little progress has been made in extending this algorithm to handle additional VRP variants, limiting the general applicability of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an extension of the linear Split that handles two cardinal VRP variants simultaneously: (i) simultaneous pickups and deliveries (VRPSPD) and (ii) time windows (VRPTW). The resulting $\u0398(n)$ algorithm is guaranteed to be optimal, assuming travel times between nodes satisfy the triangle inequality.

Motivated by the need to increase the temporal granularity of originally monthly data to enable more effective training of AI models for epidemiological forecasting, the dataset harmonizes municipal-level dengue hospitalization time series across Brazil and disaggregates them to weekly resolution (epidemiological weeks) through an interpolation protocol with a correction step that preserves monthly totals. The statistical and temporal validity of this disaggregation was assessed using a high-resolution reference dataset from the state of Sao Paulo (2024), which simultaneously provides monthly and epidemiological-week counts, enabling a direct comparison of three strategies: linear interpolation, jittering, and cubic spline. Results indicated that cubic spline interpolation achieved the highest adherence to the reference data, and this strategy was therefore adopted to generate weekly series for the 1999 to 2021 period. In addition to hospitalization time series, the dataset includes a comprehensive set of explanatory variables commonly used in epidemiological and environmental modeling, such as demographic density, CH4, CO2, and NO2 emissions, poverty and urbanization indices, maximum temperature, mean monthly precipitation, minimum relative humidity, and municipal latitude and longitude, following the same temporal disaggregation scheme to ensure multivariate compatibility.

The futurize package addresses this challenge by providing a single function, futurize(), which transpiles sequential map-reduce expressions into their parallel equivalents in the future ecosystem, which performs all the heavy lifting. By leveraging R's native pipe operator, users can parallelize existing code with minimal refactoring -- often by simply appending `|> futurize()' to an expression. The package supports classical map-reduce functions from base R, purrr, crossmap, foreach, plyr, BiocParallel, e.g., lapply(xs, fcn) |> futurize() and map(xs, fcn) |> futurize(), as well as a growing set of domain-specific packages, e.g., boot, caret, glmnet, lme4, mgcv, and tm. By abstracting away the underlying parallel machinery, and unifying handling of future options, the package enables developers to declare what to parallelize via futurize(), and end-users to choose how via plan().

Our theoretical model and Deep Q-Learning method is applied on the generator in two settings: (1) when the mid price follows a rough Heston model with generative data from this stochastic model; and (2) when the mid price corresponds to historical data of assets from the S&P 500 index and the performance of our algorithm is compared with classical benchmarks from optimal market making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fde\u7eed\u7ade\u4ef7\u540e\u6709\u6536\u76d8\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u505a\u5e02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5165\u6536\u76d8\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6700\u4f18\u505a\u5e02\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec8\u7aef\u5e93\u5b58\u60e9\u7f5a\u7ba1\u7406\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6536\u76d8\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u6536\u76d8\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u505a\u5e02\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u5e02\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

Given frequent edge updates in real graph applications, in this paper, we study connectivity query processing in fully dynamic graphs, where edges are frequently inserted or deleted. A recent solution, called D-tree, maintains a spanning tree for each connected component and applies several heuristics to reduce the depth of the tree. To improve efficiency, we propose a new spanning-tree-based solution by maintaining a disjoint-set tree simultaneously. By combining the advantages of two trees, we achieve the constant query time complexity and also significantly improve the theoretical running time in both edge insertion and edge deletion.

Although recent LLM-based Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) methods have made notable progress, they primarily optimize individual heuristics or components independently, lacking explicit exploration and exploitation of dynamic coupling relationships between multiple operators. In this paper, multi-operator optimization in MOEAs is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the improvement of interdependent operators through sequential decision-making. To address this, we propose the Evolution of Operator Combination (E2OC) framework for MOEAs, which achieves the co-evolution of design strategies and executable codes. E2OC employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to progressively search combinations of operator design strategies and adopts an operator rotation mechanism to identify effective operator configurations while supporting the integration of mainstream AHD methods as the underlying designer.

In this paper, we propose a downstream-focussed evaluation framework where a distribution of QPP estimates across a list of top-documents retrieved with several rankers is used as priors for IR fusion. While on the one hand, a distribution of these estimates closely matching that of the true retrieval qualities indicates the quality of the predictor, their usage as priors on the other hand indicates a predictor's ability to make informed choices in an IR pipeline.

Its potential in clinical medicine is transformative and includes personalized treatment planning and virtual clinical trials.

We developed a generative simulator model that takes a patient's history as input and synthesizes fine-grained, realistic future trajectories. The model was pretrained on more than 200 million clinical records.

However, existing data synthesis methods often suffer from limited diversity and lack precise control over problem difficulty, making them insufficient for supporting efficient training paradigms such as curriculum learning. To address these challenges, we propose MathMixup, a novel data synthesis paradigm that systematically generates high-quality, difficulty-controllable mathematical reasoning problems through hybrid and decomposed strategies. Automated self-checking and manual screening are incorporated to ensure semantic clarity and a well-structured difficulty gradient in the synthesized data. Building on this, we construct the MathMixupQA dataset and design a curriculum learning strategy that leverages these graded problems, supporting flexible integration with other datasets. Experimental results show that MathMixup and its curriculum learning strategy significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning performance of LLMs. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average score of 52.6\\% across seven mathematical benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.

The computations are secured with special keys called rotation keys which often take up the majority of memory. In complex FHE applications, these rotation keys can cause a large memory bottleneck limiting program throughput. Existing compilers make little effort to solve this problem, instead relying on systems with massive memory availability. This resource requirement is a barrier to FHE uptake because optimizing FHE programs by hand is challenging due to their scale, complexity and expertise required.\n  In this work, we present KeyMemRT; an MLIR based compiler and runtime framework that individually manages rotation key lifetimes to lower memory utilization and to allow arbitrary number of rotation indices to be supported without memory bloating. KeyMemRT relies on dataflow analysis to determine key lifetimes and is the first FHE compiler to provide automatic key management, handle fine-grained key-mangement and manage boostrap keys. We implement frontends for Orion and HEIR and show improvements over state-of-the-art FHE compilers.

Ground stations submit queries over an area of interest; satellites collect sensor data, process it cooperatively at light-speed using inter-satellite laser links, and return only the results. Our compute model leverages space physics to accelerate computations on LEO megaconstellations. Our distance-aware routing protocol exploits orbital geometry. In addition, our bipartite match scheduling strategy places map and reduce tasks within orbital regions while minimizing aggregation costs. We have simulated constellations of 1,000-10,000 satellites showcasing 61-79% improvement in map placement efficiency over baselines, 18-28% over greedy allocation, and 67-72% reduction in aggregation cost.

Despite strong in-sample performance, these models often degrade when confronted with evolving real-world market regimes, which can shift dramatically due to macroeconomic changes-e.g., monetary policy updates or unanticipated fluctuations in participant behavior. We identify two challenges that perpetuate this mismatch: (1) insufficient robustness in existing policy against uncertainties in high-level market fluctuations, and (2) the absence of a realistic and diverse simulation environment for training, leading to policy overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian Robust Framework that systematically integrates a macro-conditioned generative model with robust policy learning. On the data side, to generate realistic and diverse data, we propose a macro-conditioned GAN-based generator that leverages macroeconomic indicators as primary control variables, synthesizing data with faithful temporal, cross-instrument, and macro correlations. On the policy side, to learn robust policy against market fluctuations, we cast the trading process as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian Markov game, wherein an adversarial agent simulates shifting regimes by perturbing macroeconomic indicators in the macro-conditioned generator, while the trading agent-guided by a quantile belief network-maintains and updates its belief over hidden market states. The trading agent seeks a Robust Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via Bayesian neural fictitious self-play, stabilizing learning under adversarial market perturbations.

Yet fixed variance inflation factor (VIF) cut-offs are often applied uniformly across studies with very different sample sizes, even though collinearity is a finite-sample problem. We quantify how collinearity and sample size jointly affect linear regression performance and provide practical guidance for interpreting VIFs.\n  Methods: We simulated data across sample sizes N=100-100,000 and collinearity levels VIF=1-50. For each scenario we generated 1,000 datasets, fitted OLS models, and assessed coverage, mean absolute error (MAE), bias, traditional power (CI excludes 0), and precision assurance (probability the 95% CI lies within a prespecified margin around the true effect). We also evaluated a biased, misspecified setting by omitting a relevant predictor to study bias amplification.\n  Results: Under correct specification, collinearity did not materially affect nominal coverage and did not introduce systematic bias, but it reduced precision in small samples: at N=100, even mild collinearity (VIF<2) inflated MAE and markedly reduced both power metrics, whereas at N>=50,000 estimates were robust even at VIF=50. Under misspecification, collinearity strongly amplified bias, increasing errors, reducing coverage, and sharply degrading both precision assurance and traditional power even at low VIF.\n  Conclusion: VIF thresholds should not be applied mechanically. Collinearity must be interpreted in relation to sample size and potential sources of bias; removing predictors solely to reduce VIF can worsen inference via omitted-variable bias.

Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as bounded or discrete outcomes; require external inputs (for example, instrumental variables, proxies, or user-specified sensitivity parameters); necessitate full structural causal model specifications; or focus solely on population-level averages while neglecting covariate-conditional treatment effects. We overcome all four limitations simultaneously by establishing novel information-theoretic, data-driven divergence bounds. Our key theoretical contribution shows that the f-divergence between the observational distribution P(Y | A = a, X = x) and the interventional distribution P(Y | do(A = a), X = x) is upper bounded by a function of the propensity score alone. This result enables sharp partial identification of conditional causal effects directly from observational data, without requiring external sensitivity parameters, auxiliary variables, full structural specifications, or outcome boundedness assumptions. For practical implementation, we develop a semiparametric estimator satisfying Neyman orthogonality (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which ensures square-root-n consistent inference even when nuisance functions are estimated using flexible machine learning methods.

An Extended version including detailed performance analysis", "summary": "There have been a flurry of recent proposals on learned benefit estimators for index tuning. Although these learned estimators show promising improvement over what-if query optimizer calls in terms of the accuracy of estimated index benefit, they face significant limitations when applied to online index tuning, an arguably more common and more challenging scenario in real-world applications. There are two major challenges for learned index benefit estimators in online tuning: (1) limited amount of query execution feedback that can be used to train the models, and (2) constant coming of new unseen queries due to workload drifts. The combination of the two hinders the generalization capability of existing learned index benefit estimators. To overcome these challenges, we present UTune, an uncertainty-aware online index tuning framework that employs operator-level learned models with improved generalization over unseen queries. At the core of UTune is an uncertainty quantification mechanism that characterizes the inherent uncertainty of the operator-level learned models given limited online execution feedback. We further integrate uncertainty information into index selection and configuration enumeration, the key component of any index tuner, by developing a new variant of the classic $\u03b5$-greedy search strategy with uncertainty-weighted index benefits. Experimental evaluation shows that UTune not only significantly improves the workload execution time compared to state-of-the-art online index tuners but also reduces the index exploration overhead, resulting in faster convergence when the workload is relatively stable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u7ebf\u7d22\u5f15\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6UTune\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u7d22\u5f15\u8c03\u4f18\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u5c11\u548c\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u65ad\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUTune\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u5b50\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u7d22\u5f15\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u679a\u4e3e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e26\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u7d22\u5f15\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u03b5 - \u8d2a\u5fc3\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u7d22\u5f15\u8c03\u4f18\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cUTune\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7d22\u5f15\u63a2\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "UTune\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7d22\u5f15\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, recent work (Vuppalapati et al. 2023) has shown that this max-min mechanism can lead to large disparities in the total resources received by agents, even when they have the same average demand. In this paper, we introduce credit fairness, a strengthening of sharing incentives that ensures agents who lend resources in early rounds are able to recoup them in later rounds.

However, existing Spiking Transformers still lack a principled mechanism for effective temporal fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatiotemporal dependencies. Inspired by feedforward-feedback modulation in the human visual pathway, we propose TEFormer, the first Spiking Transformer framework that achieves bidirectional temporal fusion by decoupling temporal modeling across its core components. Specifically, TEFormer employs a lightweight and hyperparameter-free forward temporal fusion mechanism in the attention module, enabling fully parallel computation, while incorporating a backward gated recurrent structure in the MLP to aggregate temporal information in reverse order and reinforce temporal consistency. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that TEFormer consistently and significantly outperforms strong SNN and Spiking Transformer baselines under diverse datasets. Moreover, through the first systematic evaluation of Spiking Transformers under different neural encoding schemes, we show that the performance gains of TEFormer remain stable across encoding choices, indicating that the improved temporal modeling directly translates into reliable accuracy improvements across varied spiking representations. These results collectively establish TEFormer as an effective and general framework for temporal modeling in Spiking Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpiking Transformer\u6846\u67b6TEFormer\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Spiking Transformers\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6316\u6398\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u901a\u8def\u524d\u9988 - \u53cd\u9988\u8c03\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65e0\u8d85\u53c2\u524d\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728MLP\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u53cd\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u53cd\u5411\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTEFormer\u59cb\u7ec8\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSNN\u548cSpiking Transformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "TEFormer\u662fSpiking Transformers\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $\u03b2$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $\u03b3(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $\u03c1$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $\u03b1_\u03c1$ (combining $\u03b3(m)$, $\u03c1$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>\u03b2$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u6821\u51c6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6df1\u5ea6b\u5143\u6811\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u89e3\u91caLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5806\u6808\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6570\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u53d8\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u9884\u7b97\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDALIA\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDALIA\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u534f\u8bae\u66b4\u9732\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u8d44\u6e90\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u660e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86DALIA\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

Although the analysis of such recordings is costly from a clinical point of view, advances in machine learning techniques are making the processing of this type of data increasingly accurate and efficient.

The selection techniques allow to reduce the number of features used by the classifiers by determining which ones provide the most information about the problem. The results show that machine learning methods, in particular neural networks, are suitable for PD classification and that the number of features can be significantly reduced without affecting the performance of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bca\u65ad\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9002\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u8bb0\u5f55\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u786e\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Among all valid confidence sets for the multinomial parameter, minimum-volume confidence sets (MVCs) are optimal in that they minimize average volume, but they are defined as level sets of an exact p-value that is discontinuous and difficult to compute. Rather than attempting to characterize the geometry of MVCs directly, this paper studies a practically motivated decision problem: given two observed multinomial outcomes, can one certify whether their MVCs intersect? We present a certified, tolerance-aware algorithm for this intersection problem. The method exploits the fact that likelihood ordering induces halfspace constraints in log-odds coordinates, enabling adaptive geometric partitioning of parameter space and computable lower and upper bounds on p-values over each cell. For three categories, this yields an efficient and provably sound algorithm that either certifies intersection, certifies disjointness, or returns an indeterminate result when the decision lies within a prescribed margin. We further show how the approach extends to higher dimensions.

We model demand using a linear system that captures both substitution and complementarity effects across products. We first establish existence and uniqueness of a pure--strategy Nash equilibrium under economically standard diagonal dominance conditions. Our main contribution is the derivation of a tight worst--case lower bound on the ratio between decentralized revenue and the optimal centralized revenue. We show that this efficiency loss is governed by a single scalar parameter, denoted by $\u03bc$, which measures the aggregate strength of cross--price effects relative to own--price sensitivities. In particular, we prove that the revenue ratio is bounded below by $4(1-\u03bc)/(2-\u03bc)^2$, and we demonstrate the tightness of this bound by constructing a symmetric market topology in which the bound is exactly attained.

However, existing studies largely emphasize the raw speedup obtained by porting individual algorithms from CPUs to GPUs. Consequently, these studies offer limited insight into when and why GPU parallelism fundamentally benefits EAs. To address this gap, we investigate how GPU parallelism alters the behavior of EAs beyond simple acceleration metrics. We conduct a systematic empirical study of 16 representative EAs on 30 benchmark problems. Specifically, we compare CPU and GPU executions across a wide range of problem dimensionalities and population sizes. Our results reveal that the impact of GPU acceleration is highly heterogeneous and depends strongly on algorithmic structure. We further demonstrate that conventional fixed-budget evaluation based on the number of function evaluations (FEs) is inadequate for GPU execution. In contrast, fixed-time evaluation uncovers performance characteristics that are unobservable under small or practically constrained FE budgets, particularly for adaptive and exploration-oriented algorithms. Moreover, we identify distinct scaling regimes in which GPU parallelism is beneficial, saturates, or degrades as problem dimensionality and population size increase. Crucially, we show that large populations enabled by GPUs not only improve hardware utilization but also reveal algorithm-specific convergence and diversity dynamics that are difficult to observe under CPU-constrained settings. Consequently, our findings indicate that GPU parallelism is not strictly an implementation detail, but a pivotal factor that influences how EAs should be evaluated, compared, and designed for modern computing platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76GPU\u5e76\u884c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u627e\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7f29\u653e\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660eGPU\u5e76\u884c\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9GPU\u5e76\u884c\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u4f7f\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u7a7a\u767d\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u572830\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83CPU\u548cGPU\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u79cd\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "GPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8eGPU\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7f29\u653e\u5236\u5ea6\uff1bGPU\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5927\u79cd\u7fa4\u80fd\u63ed\u793aCPU\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "GPU\u5e76\u884c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

It typically involves two components: a tokenizer that learns item identifiers and a recommender trained on them. Existing methods often decouple tokenization from recommendation or rely on asynchronous alternating optimization, limiting full end-to-end alignment. To address this, we unify the tokenizer and recommender under the ultimate recommendation objective via differentiable soft item identifiers, enabling joint end-to-end training. However, this introduces three challenges: training-inference discrepancy due to soft-to-hard mismatch, item identifier collapse from codeword usage imbalance, and collaborative signal deficiency due to an overemphasis on fine-grained token-level semantics.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose UniGRec, a unified generative recommendation framework that addresses them from three perspectives. UniGRec employs Annealed Inference Alignment during tokenization to smoothly bridge soft training and hard inference, a Codeword Uniformity Regularization to prevent identifier collapse and encourage codebook diversity, and a Dual Collaborative Distillation mechanism that distills collaborative priors from a lightweight teacher model to jointly guide both the tokenizer and the recommender.

While in the former problem, a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently using the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm, the existence of a stable matching is not guaranteed in the latter problem, but can be determined efficiently using Irving's algorithm. However, the computation of matchings that minimise the instability, either due to the presence of additional constraints on the size of the matching or due to restrictive preference cycles, gives rise to a collection of infamously intractable almost-stable matching problems. In practice, however, not every agent is able or likely to initiate deviations caused by blocking pairs. Suppose we knew, for example, due to a set of requirements or estimates based on historical data, which agents are likely to initiate deviations - the deviators - and which are likely to comply with whatever matching they are presented with - the conformists. Can we decide efficiently whether a matching exists in which no deviator is blocking, i.e., in which no deviator has an incentive to initiate a deviation? Furthermore, can we find matchings in which only a few deviators are blocking? We characterise the computational complexity of this question in bipartite and non-bipartite preference settings. Surprisingly, these problems prove computationally intractable in strong ways: for example, unlike in the classical setting, where every agent is considered a deviator, in this extension, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists where no deviator is blocking.

The computational cost of balanced butterfly counting remains a major bottleneck on large-scale graphs. In this work, we present the highly parallel implementations for balanced butterfly counting for both multicore CPUs and GPUs. The proposed multi-core algorithm (M-BBC) employs fine-grained vertex-level parallelism to accelerate wedge-based counting while eliminating the generation of unbalanced substructures. To improve scalability, we develop a GPU-based method (G-BBC) that uses a tile-based parallel approach to effectively leverage shared memory while handling large vertex sets. We then present an improved variation, G-BBC++, which integrates dynamic scheduling to mitigate workload imbalance and maximize throughput. We conduct an experimental assessment of the proposed methods across 15 real-world datasets. Experimental results exhibit that M-BBC achieves speedups of up to 71.13x (average 38.13x) over the sequential baseline BB2K. The GPU-based algorithms deliver even greater improvements, achieving up to 13,320x speedup (average 2,600x) over BB2K and outperforming M-BBC by up to 186x (average 50x). These results indicate the substantial scalability and efficiency of our parallel algorithms and establish a robust foundation for high-performance signed motif analysis on massive bipartite graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6838CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u5e73\u8861\u8774\u8776\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e73\u8861\u8774\u8776\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6838\u7b97\u6cd5M - BBC\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9876\u70b9\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u6570\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1GPU\u65b9\u6cd5G - BBC\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u74e6\u7247\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7248G - BBC++\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "M - BBC\u6bd4\u987a\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebfBB2K\u6700\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f71.13x\uff1bGPU\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4BB2K\u6700\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f13320x\uff0c\u6bd4M - BBC\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb186x\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u7b26\u53f7 motif \u5206\u6790\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA), a framework in which stochastic assembly combined with differential persistence biases populations toward longer-lived motifs.

We apply SDA/GA to chemical symbol space using SMILES fragments with recombination, mutation, and a heuristic stability function.

However, recent approaches typically disentangle domain-invariant features shared between source and target domains, as well as domain-specific features for each domain. However, they often rely solely on domain-invariant features combined with target domain-specific features, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitations, this paper presents the Adversarial Alignment and Disentanglement Cross-Domain Recommendation ($A^2DCDR$ ) model, an innovative approach designed to capture a comprehensive range of cross-domain information, including both domain-invariant and valuable non-aligned features. The $A^2DCDR$ model enhances cross-domain recommendation through three key components: refining MMD with adversarial training for better generalization, employing a feature disentangler and reconstruction mechanism for intra-domain disentanglement, and introducing a novel fused representation combining domain-invariant, non-aligned features with original contextual data. Experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B testing show that $A^2DCDR$ outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and practical applicability.

We formalize AGI axiomatically as a distributional, resource-bounded semantic predicate, indexed by a task family, a task distribution, a performance functional, and explicit resource budgets. Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and G\u00f6del--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed.

While parsers prioritize semantic accuracy (i.e., event identification), they often obscure deep correlations between static templates and dynamic variables that are critical for storage efficiency. In this paper, we investigate this misalignment through a comprehensive empirical study and propose LogPrism, a framework that bridges the gap via unified redundancy encoding. Rather than relying on a rigid pre-parsing step, LogPrism dynamically integrates structural extraction with variable encoding by constructing a Unified Redundancy Tree (URT). This hierarchical approach effectively mines \"structure+variable\" co-occurrence patterns, capturing deep contextual redundancies while accelerating processing through pre-emptive pattern encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets confirm that LogPrism establishes a new state-of-the-art. It achieves the highest compression ratio on 13 datasets, surpassing leading baselines by margins of 4.7% to 80.9%, while delivering superior throughput at 29.87 MB/s (1.68$\\times$~43.04$\\times$ faster than competitors).

This approach implicitly assumes uniform contribution across all embedding coordinates and overlooks the possibility that optimal structural information may be concentrated in specific regions of the embedding space. This study reframes embeddings as searchable landscapes and adapts Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA) to systematically traverse embedding coordinates, treating the dimension index as a pseudo-temporal ordering analogous to intensive longitudinal trajectories. A large-scale Monte Carlo simulation embedded items representing five dimensions of grandiose narcissism using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, generating network estimations across systematically varied item pool sizes (3-40 items per dimension) and embedding depths (3-1,298 dimensions). Results reveal that Total Entropy Fit Index (TEFI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) leads to competing optimization trajectories across the embedding landscape. TEFI achieves minima at deep embedding ranges (900--1,200 dimensions) where entropy-based organization is maximal but structural accuracy degrades, whereas NMI peaks at shallow depths where dimensional recovery is strongest but entropy-based fit remains suboptimal. Single-metric optimization produces structurally incoherent solutions, whereas a weighted composite criterion identifies embedding dimensions depth regions that jointly balance accuracy and organization. Optimal embedding depth scales systematically with item pool size.

Initially designed for AI, the WSE architecture is also well-suited for High Performance Computing (HPC). However, its distributed asynchronous programming model diverges significantly from the simple sequential or bulk-synchronous programs that one would typically derive for a given mathematical program description. Targeting the WSE requires a bespoke re-implementation when porting existing code. The absence of WSE support in compilers such as MLIR, meant that there was little hope for automating this process.\n  Stencils are ubiquitous in HPC, and in this paper we explore the hypothesis that domain specific information about stencils can be leveraged by the compiler to automatically target the WSE without requiring application-level code changes. We present a compiler pipeline that transforms stencil-based kernels into highly optimized CSL code for the WSE, bridging the semantic gap between the mathematical representation of the problem and the WSE's asynchronous execution model. Based upon five benchmarks across three HPC programming technologies, running on both the Cerebras WSE2 and WSE3, our approach delivers comparable, if not slightly better, performance than manually optimized code.

Traditional boosting algorithms, designed for fully observed random samples, often struggle with real-world problems, particularly with interval-censored data. This type of data is common in survival analysis and time-to-event studies where exact event times are unobserved but fall within known intervals. Effective handling of such data is crucial in fields like medical research, reliability engineering, and social sciences. In this work, we introduce novel nonparametric boosting methods for regression and classification tasks with interval-censored data. Our approaches leverage censoring unbiased transformations to adjust loss functions and impute transformed responses while maintaining model accuracy. Implemented via functional gradient descent, these methods ensure scalability and adaptability.

By enabling users to query databases through natural language rather than SQL, this technology significantly lowers the barrier to data analysis. However, generating accurate SQL from natural language remains challenging due to ambiguity in user queries, the complexity of schema linking, limited generalization across SQL dialects, and the need for domain-specific understanding. In this study, we propose a Single-Agent Self-Refinement with Ensemble Voting (SSEV) pipeline built on PET-SQL that operates without ground-truth data, integrating self-refinement with Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) and its randomized variant (RWMA). Experimental results show that the SSEV achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, attaining execution accuracies of 85.5% on Spider 1.0-Dev, 86.4% on Spider 1.0-Test, and 66.3% on BIRD-Dev. Building on insights from the SSEV pipeline, we further propose ReCAPAgent-SQL (Refinement-Critique-Act-Plan agent-based SQL framework) to address the growing complexity of enterprise databases and real-world Text-to-SQL tasks. The framework integrates multiple specialized agents for planning, external knowledge retrieval, critique, action generation, self-refinement, schema linking, and result validation, enabling iterative refinement of SQL predictions through agent collaboration. ReCAPAgent-SQL's WMA results achieve 31% execution accuracy on the first 100 queries of Spider 2.0-Lite, demonstrating significant improvements in handling real-world enterprise scenarios.

However, LLM-based RS (LLM-RS) often inadvertently perpetuates bias present in the training data, leading to severe fairness issues. Addressing these fairness problems in LLM-RS faces two significant challenges. 1) Existing debiasing methods, designed for specific bias types, lack the generality to handle diverse or emerging biases in real-world applications. 2) Debiasing methods relying on retraining are computationally infeasible given the massive parameter scale of LLMs. To overcome these challenges, we propose FUDLR (Fast Unified Debiasing for LLM-RS). The core idea is to reformulate the debiasing problem as an efficient machine unlearning task with two stages. First, FUDLR identifies bias-inducing samples to unlearn through a novel bias-agnostic mask, optimized to balance fairness improvement with accuracy preservation. Its bias-agnostic design allows adaptability to various or co-existing biases simply by incorporating different fairness metrics. Second, FUDLR performs efficient debiasing by estimating and removing the influence of identified samples on model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUDLR effectively and efficiently improves fairness while preserving recommendation accuracy, offering a practical path toward socially responsible LLM-RS.

However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u9610\u8ff0\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e25\u683c\u6027\u53ef\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u884d\u751f\u7684\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u53ef\u66f4\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002"}}

The core innovation is a robust ground-plane homography estimation that links fixed traffic camera views to satellite orthoimagery. This process rectifies the camera's oblique perspective, ensuring that pixel distances accurately represent real-world distances. This enables the acquisition of features such as vehicle trajectory, speed, deceleration, and braking severity without the need for camera calibration. The pipeline employs the MAGSAC++ estimator to build the homography, converting YOLO11 object detections into a rectified top-down coordinate system. All detection and trajectory data are stored in a ClickHouse database for subsequent analysis. A real-world case study at two signalized intersections in Key West, Florida, showcased the system's capabilities. Across two days of daytime footage, braking activity at the higher-volume intersection peaked around 4 PM at approximately 57.5 events per hour, while the second intersection peaked around 10 AM at roughly 15.5 events per hour. The spatial analysis revealed that most braking events initiated upstream, with mild and moderate braking mostly occurring 30 to 45+ meters away from the stop bar and severe braking distributed throughout, but particularly concentrated in lanes with higher interaction and merging activity. The findings highlight the significant potential of this centralized safety information system to support connected vehicles, facilitating proactive traffic management, crash mitigation, and data-driven roadway design and safety analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5f55\u50cf\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u9762\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76f8\u673a\u6821\u51c6\u83b7\u53d6\u8f66\u8f86\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ecf\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u652f\u6301\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5f55\u50cf\u3001\u83b7\u53d6\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528MAGSAC++\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5c06YOLO11\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u9876\u89c6\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u4e8eClickHouse\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u57fa\u97e6\u65af\u7279\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6bb5\u5236\u52a8\u6d3b\u52a8\u9ad8\u5cf0\u53ca\u5236\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u652f\u6301\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u4e8b\u6545\u7f13\u89e3\u548c\u9053\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFlashMoE\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u975e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u5378\u8f7d\u5230SSD\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0bMoE\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MoE\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56DRAM\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5927\uff0cRAM\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlashMoE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u5378\u8f7d\u5230SSD\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u56e0\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u684c\u9762\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\uff0cFlashMoE\u6bd4LRU\u548cLFU\u7b49\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe51%\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709MoE\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe2.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashMoE\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MoE\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Substantiating the effectiveness of prevalent load shaping strategies, such as those based on grid-level average carbon intensity, locational marginal price, or marginal emissions, is challenging due to the lack of detailed counterfactual data required for accurate attribution. This study uses a series of calibrated granular ERCOT day-ahead direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) simulations for counterfactual analysis of a broad set of load shaping strategies on grid CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. In terms of annual grid level CO2 emissions reductions, LMP-based shaping outperforms other common strategies, but can be significantly improved upon. Examining the performance of practicable strategies under different grid conditions motivates a more effective load shaping approach: one that \"cherry-picks\" a daily strategy based on observable grid signals and historical data. The cherry-picking approach to power load shaping is applicable to any large flexible consumer on the electricity grid, such as data centers, distributed energy resources and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u8d1f\u8377\u6574\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51CO\u2082\u6392\u653e\u548c\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LMP\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u6392\u4f18\u4f46\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u62e9\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6d41\u884c\u8d1f\u8377\u6574\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6821\u51c6\u7684ERCOT\u65e5\u524d\u76f4\u6d41\u6700\u4f18\u6f6e\u6d41\uff08DC - OPF\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u8d1f\u8377\u6574\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u5e74\u5ea6\u7535\u7f51CO\u2082\u51cf\u6392\u770b\uff0cLMP\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u89c1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u201c\u62e9\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u201d\u6bcf\u65e5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8d1f\u8377\u6574\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u7075\u6d3b\u7528\u7535\u65b9\u3002"}}

Current systems exhibit fundamental limitations: single-modality input, one-shot generation, and rigid workflows. While LLM-based approaches show potential for these complex requirements, they introduce reliability challenges including catastrophic failures and infinite loop susceptibility. To address this gap, we propose MultiVis-Agent, a logic rule-enhanced multi-agent framework for reliable multi-modal and multi-scenario visualization generation. Our approach introduces a four-layer logic rule framework that provides mathematical guarantees for system reliability while maintaining flexibility. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our logic rules are mathematical constraints that guide LLM reasoning rather than replacing it. We formalize the MultiVis task spanning four scenarios from basic generation to iterative refinement, and develop MultiVis-Bench, a benchmark with over 1,000 cases for multi-modal visualization evaluation.

Existing LSR approaches have relied almost exclusively on uncased backbone models, whose vocabularies exclude case-sensitive distinctions, thereby reducing vocabulary mismatch. However, the most recent state-of-the-art language models are only available in cased versions. Despite this shift, the impact of backbone model casing on LSR has not been studied, potentially posing a risk to the viability of the method going forward. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate paired cased and uncased versions of the same backbone models across multiple datasets to assess their suitability for LSR. Our findings show that LSR models with cased backbone models by default perform substantially worse than their uncased counterparts; however, this gap can be eliminated by pre-processing the text to lowercase. Moreover, our token-level analysis reveals that, under lowercasing, cased models almost entirely suppress cased vocabulary items and behave effectively as uncased models, explaining their restored performance. This result broadens the applicability of recent cased models to the LSR setting and facilitates the integration of stronger backbone architectures into sparse retrieval.

However, most existing learning path planning approaches lack transparency, adaptability, and learner-centered explainability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning (MALPP) framework that leverages a role- and rule-based collaboration mechanism among intelligent agents, each powered by LLMs. The framework includes three task-specific agents: a learner analytics agent, a path planning agent, and a reflection agent. These agents collaborate via structured prompts and predefined rules to analyze learning profiles, generate tailored learning paths, and iteratively refine them with interpretable feedback. Grounded in Cognitive Load Theory and Zone of Proximal Development, the system ensures that recommended paths are cognitively aligned and pedagogically meaningful.

Motivated by the emerging bottleneck in large language model (LLM) serving, we study a particularly stringent regime of load balancing that arises in barrier-synchronized, stateful systems: work cannot be freely migrated and progress is gated by the slowest participant at each step, so heterogeneity and temporal drift in workloads create persistent stragglers and substantial idle time. LLM serving under data-parallel decoding provides a prominent modern instance: in production traces, barrier-induced idle can exceed 40% of compute time per decode step. Here we develop a universal load-balancing principle, which admits a step-wise finite-horizon integer-optimization formulation and yields worst-case guarantees: across LLM decode models and a broader class of non-decreasing workload drift processes, it reduces long-run imbalance by a factor that grows with batch size and system scale. Extensive experiments corroborate the theory, showing substantial improvements in throughput and latency together with reductions in energy consumption.

For high-dimensional data from multiple studies or environments, one goal is to understand which underlying factors are common to all studies, and which factors are study or environment-specific. As a particular example, we consider platelet gene expression data from patients in different disease groups. In this data, factors correspond to clusters of genes which are co-expressed; we may expect some clusters (or biological pathways) to be active for all diseases, while some clusters are only active for a specific disease. To learn these factors, we consider a nonlinear multi-study factor model, which allows for both shared and specific factors. To fit this model, we propose a multi-study sparse variational autoencoder. The underlying model is sparse in that each observed feature (i.e. each dimension of the data) depends on a small subset of the latent factors. In the genomics example, this means each gene is active in only a few biological processes. Further, the model implicitly induces a penalty on the number of latent factors, which helps separate the shared factors from the group-specific factors.

We study disability aware descriptions for person centric images, where models often transition from evidence grounded factual description to interpretation shift including introduction of unsupported inferences beyond observable visual evidence. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a benchmark based on paired Neutral Prompts (NP) and Disability-Contextualised Prompts (DP) and evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs under a zero-shot setting across 9 disability categories. Our evaluation framework treats interpretive fidelity as core objective and combines standard text-based metrics capturing affective degradation through shifts in sentiment, social regard and response length with an LLM-as-judge protocol, validated by annotators with lived experience of disability. We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing.

This study presents an empirical analysis of developing a 7420 line Terminal User Interface framework for the Ring programming language, completed in roughly ten hours of active work spread across three days using a purely prompt driven workflow with Claude Code, Opus 4.5. The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment.

Moreover, in practical scenarios such as adding/dropping teammates or facing environment dynamics that differ from the training, CTDE methods can be brittle and costly to retrain, whereas distributed approaches allow agents to adapt using only local information and peer-to-peer communication. We present a distributed MARL framework that removes the need for centralized critics or global information. Firstly, we develop a novel Distributed Graph Attention Network (D-GAT) that performs global state inference through multi-hop communication, where agents integrate neighbor features via input-dependent attention weights in a fully distributed manner. Leveraging D-GAT, we develop the distributed graph-attention MAPPO (DG-MAPPO) -- a distributed MARL framework where agents optimize local policies and value functions using local observations, multi-hop communication, and shared/averaged rewards. Empirical evaluation on the StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines, achieving superior coordination across a wide range of cooperative tasks with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. Our distributed MARL framework provides a principled and scalable solution for robust collaboration, eliminating the need for centralized training or global observability.

Extended version of work under submission", "summary": "Graphs are central to modeling relationships in scientific computing, data analysis, and AI/ML, but their growing scale can exceed the memory and compute capacity of single nodes, requiring distributed solutions. Existing distributed graph framework, however, face fundamental challenges: graph algorithms are latency-bound, suffer from irregular memory access, and often impose synchronization costs that limit scalability and efficiency. In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the NWGraph library integrated with the HPX runtime system. By leveraging HPX's asynchronous many-task model, our approach aims to reduce synchronization overhead, improve load balance, and provide a foundation for distributed graph analytics. We evaluate this approach using two representative algorithms: Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and (PageRank). Our initial results show that BFS achieves better performance than the distributed Boost Graph Library (BGL), while PageRank remains more challenging, with current implementation not yet outperforming BGL.

We present simple necessary conditions for the first player to have a winning strategy, and establish an equivalence between winning sets that guarantee a win for the first player and maximal prefix codes. Using this equivalence, we derive a necessary algebraic condition for winning, and exhibit a family of games for which this algebraic condition is in fact equivalent to winning.

Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations.

Existing methods relying on keyword frequency or query spikes are inherently slow and ineffective in these sparse settings, lagging behind real-world shifts in attention. We introduce RTTP, a novel Real-Time Trending Prediction framework that generates search queries directly from news content instead of waiting for users to issue them. RTTP leverages a continual learning LLM (CL-LLM) that converts posts into search-style queries and scores them using engagement strength + creator authority, enabling early trend surfacing before search volume forms. To ensure adaptation without degrading reasoning, we propose Mix-Policy DPO, a new preference-based continual learning approach that combines on-policy stability with off-policy novelty to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during model upgrades. Deployed at production scale on Facebook and Meta AI products, RTTP delivers +91.4% improvement in tail-trend detection precision@500 and +19% query generation accuracy over industry baselines, while sustaining stable performance after multi-week online training.

However, their ability to improve existing programming answers in a human-like manner remains underexplored. On technical question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow (SO), contributors often revise answers based on user comments that identify errors, inefficiencies, or missing explanations. Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool. Overall, AUTOCOMBAT demonstrates the potential of scalable, feedback-driven answer refinement to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of technical knowledge platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6574\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReSOlve\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\uff0c\u63a8\u51faAUTOCOMBAT\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u4ee5\u7c7b\u4eba\u65b9\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0cSO\u4e0a\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u53cd\u9988\u672a\u88ab\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u8fc7\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ReSOlve\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63a8\u51faAUTOCOMBAT\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "DeepSeek\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u597d\uff1bAUTOCOMBAT\u6539\u8fdb\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a84.5%\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u613f\u91c7\u7528\u6216\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "conclusion": "AUTOCOMBAT\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u6280\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The proposed methodology exploits a Complex-valued Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) trained exclusively on clutter-plus-noise to perform Out-Of-Distribution detection. By operating directly on in-phase / quadrature samples, the CVAE preserves phase and Doppler structure and is assessed in two configurations: (i) using unprocessed range profiles and (ii) after local whitening, where per-range covariance estimates are obtained from neighboring profiles. Using extensive simulations together with real sea-clutter data from the CSIR maritime dataset, we benchmark performance against classical and adaptive detectors (MF, NMF, AMF-SCM, ANMF-SCM, ANMF-Tyler). In both configurations, the CVAE yields a higher detection probability Pd at matched false-alarm rate Pfa, with the most notable improvements observed under whitening. We further integrate the CVAE with the ANMF through a weighted log-p fusion rule at the decision level, attaining enhanced robustness in strongly non-Gaussian clutter and enabling empirically calibrated Pfa control under H0. Overall, the results demonstrate that statistical normalization combined with complex-valued generative modeling substantively improves detection in realistic sea-clutter conditions, and that the fused CVAE-ANMF scheme constitutes a competitive alternative to established model-based detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u5e72\u6270\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f31\u590d\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528CVAE\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0cCVAE - ANMF\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d77\u4e0a\u96f7\u8fbe\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f31\u590d\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u5728\u6742\u6ce2\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u590d\u503c\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CVAE\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06CVAE\u4e0eANMF\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0bCVAE\u5728\u5339\u914d\u865a\u8b66\u7387\u65f6\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u767d\u5316\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u663e\u8457\uff0cCVAE - ANMF\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5f3a\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6742\u6ce2\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u5e76\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u865a\u8b66\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u590d\u503c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5b9e\u9645\u6d77\u6742\u6ce2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cCVAE - ANMF\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike inverse game theory and multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning, which typically infer utility/reward parameters inside a structured mechanism, our target includes unstructured mechanism -- a (possibly neural) mapping from joint actions to per-agent payoffs. Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games. DIML reliably recovers identifiable incentive differences and supports counterfactual prediction, where its performance rivals tabular enumeration oracle in small environments and its convergence scales to large, hundred-participant environments.

Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSMART\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u683c\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u53c2\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u4ea4\u4e92\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u7269\u7406\u573a\u3002", "result": "SMART\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u683c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "SMART\u5177\u5907\u8fdb\u884c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

On Twitter (X), approximately one in five tweets contains at least one URL, underscoring their central role in information dissemination. While prior studies have examined the motivations of authors who share URLs, such author-centered intentions are difficult to observe in practice. To enable broader downstream use, this work investigates reader-centered interpretations, i.e., how users perceive the intentions behind hyperlinks included in posts. We develop an intent taxonomy for including hyperlinks in social posts through a hybrid approach that begins with a bottom-up, data-driven process using large-scale crowdsourced annotations, and is then refined using large language model assistance to generate descriptive category names and precise definitions. The final taxonomy comprises 6 top-level categories and 26 fine-grained intention classes, capturing diverse communicative purposes. Applying this taxonomy, we annotate and analyze 1000 user posts, revealing that advertising, arguing, and sharing are the most prevalent intentions.

Existing process-based and data-driven models are either highly sensitive to sparse data or lack the physical interpretability required for climate-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce PhysE-Inv, a novel framework that integrates a sophisticated sequential architecture, an LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Multi-head Attention and physics-guided contrastive learning, with physics-guided inference.Our core innovation lies in a surjective, physics-constrained inversion methodology. This methodology first leverages the hydrostatic balance forward model as a target-formulation proxy, enabling effective learning in the absence of direct $h_s$ ground truth; second, it uses reconstruction physics regularization over a latent space to dynamically discover hidden physical parameters from noisy, incomplete time-series input. Evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, PhysE-Inv significantly improves prediction performance, reducing error by 20\\% while demonstrating superior physical consistency and resilience to data sparsity compared to empirical methods.

However, current NER models typically output a single predicted label sequence without any accompanying measure of uncertainty, leaving downstream applications vulnerable to cascading errors. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for adapting sequence-labeling-based NER models to produce uncertainty-aware prediction sets. These prediction sets are collections of full-sentence labelings that are guaranteed to contain the correct labeling with a user-specified confidence level. This approach serves a role analogous to confidence intervals in classical statistics by providing formal guarantees about the reliability of model predictions. Our method builds on conformal prediction, which offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. We design efficient nonconformity scoring functions to construct efficient, well-calibrated prediction sets that support both unconditional and class-conditional coverage. This framework accounts for heterogeneity across sentence length, language, entity type, and number of entities within a sentence.

In the canonical two-dimensional spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with unconditional imitation introduced by Nowak and May (1992), simulations on a Moore lattice show an abrupt drop in cooperation near the temptation $T\\approx5/3$, yet even under these harsh conditions cooperative structures can still arise. However, the nucleation rates of these motifs, and their contribution along the full cooperation curve had not been quantified. Here we show, using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations combined with automatic cluster classification, that on the Moore lattice for $T\\ge5/3$ residual cooperation is sustained exclusively by $3\\times3$ (or larger) rectangular cooperator bricks, whereas on degree-8 random-regular graphs for $T\\gtrsim1.5$ it is dominated by star-like motifs (1 hub + 8 leaves). Once the dynamics becomes nucleation limited, the macroscopic cooperation level is therefore governed by the statistics of a few exceptionally resilient shapes, rather than by many different cooperator motifs. Furthermore, we show that the lattice cooperation collapse near $T=5/3$ is kinetic rather than critical: the reduction in cooperation is not due to a loss of growth capacity of rectangular bricks, but to the progressive destabilisation of the subcritical motifs that dominate just below this threshold. Our results show that residual cooperation at high temptation is a rare-event nucleation phenomenon governed by a small set of topological traps, and highlight the value of motif-level analysis for explaining and engineering cooperation in spatial, social, and technological networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6210\u6838\u7387\u53ca\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8\u8bf1\u60d1\u4e0b\u6b8b\u4f59\u5408\u4f5c\u662f\u7531\u5c11\u6570\u62d3\u6251\u9677\u9631\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6210\u6838\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u4eba\u672a\u91cf\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6210\u6838\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u5408\u4f5c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728Moore\u6676\u683c\u4e0aT\u22655/3\u65f6\u6b8b\u4f59\u5408\u4f5c\u75313\u00d73\u6216\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u5408\u4f5c\u7816\u5757\u7ef4\u6301\uff0c\u5728\u5ea6\u4e3a8\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u4e0aT\u22731.5\u65f6\u7531\u661f\u578b\u56fe\u6848\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b\u6676\u683c\u5728T = 5/3\u9644\u8fd1\u5408\u4f5c\u5d29\u6e83\u662f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u800c\u975e\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8bf1\u60d1\u4e0b\u6b8b\u4f59\u5408\u4f5c\u662f\u7531\u5c11\u6570\u62d3\u6251\u9677\u9631\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6210\u6838\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u57fa\u5e8f\u6c34\u5e73\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Second, behavior varies by intent. Fact-seeking sessions exhibit high repetition that increases over time, while sessions requiring reasoning sustain broader exploration. Third, agents reuse evidence across steps. On average, 54% of newly introduced query terms appear in the accumulated evidence context, with contributions from earlier steps beyond the most recent retrieval. The findings suggest that agentic search may benefit from repetition-aware early stopping, intent-adaptive retrieval budgets, and explicit cross-step context tracking.

However, existing automated approaches remain insufficient. Traditional static analysis methods struggle to precisely capture contextual dependencies, especially when vulnerabilities span multiple functions or modules. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to retrieve and exploit sufficient contextual information, resulting in incomplete reasoning and unreliable outcomes. Meanwhile, recurring vulnerabilities emerge repeatedly due to code reuse and shared logic, making historical vulnerability knowledge an indispensable foundation for effective vulnerability detection and repair. Nevertheless, prior approaches such as clone-based detection and patch porting, have not fully leveraged this knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MAVM, a multi-agent framework for end-to-end recurring vulnerability management. MAVM integrates five components, including a vulnerability knowledge base, detection, confirmation, repair, and validation, into a unified multi-agent pipeline. We construct a knowledge base from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, thereby addressing the underuse of historical knowledge in prior work and mitigating the lack of domain-specific expertise in LLMs. Furthermore, we design context-retrieval tools that allow agents to extract and reason over repository-level information, overcoming the contextual limitations of previous methods. Based on agents, MAVM effectively simulates real-world security workflows. To evaluate the performance of MAVM, we construct a dataset containing 78 real-world patch-porting cases (covering 114 function-level migrations).

However, real-world web-scale settings are rife with missing views and continuously emerging classes, which pose significant obstacles to robust learning. Prevailing methods are ill-equipped for this reality, as they either lack adaptability to new classes or incur exponential parameter growth when handling all possible missing-view patterns, severely limiting their scalability in web environments. To systematically address this gap, we formally introduce a novel task, termed \\emph{incomplete multi-view multi-label class incremental learning} (IMvMLCIL), which requires models to simultaneously address heterogeneous missing views and dynamic class expansion. To tackle this task, we propose \\textsf{E2PL}, an Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning framework for IMvMLCIL. \\textsf{E2PL} unifies two novel prompt designs: \\emph{task-tailored prompts} for class-incremental adaptation and \\emph{missing-aware prompts} for the flexible integration of arbitrary view-missing scenarios. To fundamentally address the exponential parameter explosion inherent in missing-aware prompts, we devise an \\emph{efficient prototype tensorization} module, which leverages atomic tensor decomposition to elegantly reduce the prompt parameter complexity from exponential to linear w.r.t. the number of views. We further incorporate a \\emph{dynamic contrastive learning} strategy explicitly model the complex dependencies among diverse missing-view patterns, thus enhancing the model's robustness.

Code available at: https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/knexa-fl", "summary": "Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves.

These characteristics make it difficult for conventional retrieval-augmented generation pipelines to recover the statutory elements required for accurate retrieval. Dense retrievers focus primarily on the literal surface form of the query, whereas lightweight rerankers lack the legal-reasoning capacity needed to assess statutory applicability. We present LegalMALR, a retrieval framework that integrates a Multi-Agent Query Understanding System (MAS) with a zero-shot large-language-model-based reranking module (LLM Reranker). MAS generates diverse, legally grounded reformulations and conducts iterative dense retrieval to broaden candidate coverage. To stabilise the stochastic behaviour of LLM-generated rewrites, we optimise a unified MAS policy using Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization(GRPO). The accumulated candidate set is subsequently evaluated by the LLM Reranker, which performs natural-language legal reasoning to produce the final ranking. We further construct CSAID, a dataset of 118 difficult Chinese legal queries annotated with multiple statutory labels, and evaluate LegalMALR on both CSAID and the public STARD benchmark. Experiments show that LegalMALR substantially outperforms strong Retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multi-perspective query interpretation, reinforcement-based policy optimisation, and large-model reranking for statute retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u6cd5\u89c4\u68c0\u7d22\u7684LegalMALR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6392\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u7d22\u6cd5\u89c4\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLegalMALR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210MAS\u548cLLM Reranker\uff0c\u7528GRPO\u4f18\u5316MAS\u7b56\u7565\uff0cLLM Reranker\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u5728CSAID\u548cSTARD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLegalMALR\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6392\u5bf9\u6cd5\u89c4\u68c0\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

We introduce Spectral Filtering Operator (SFO), a neural operator that parameterizes integral kernels using the Universal Spectral Basis (USB), a fixed, global orthonormal basis derived from the eigenmodes of the Hilbert matrix in spectral filtering theory. Motivated by our theoretical finding that the discrete Green's functions of shift-invariant PDE discretizations exhibit spatial Linear Dynamical System (LDS) structure, we prove that these kernels admit compact approximations in the USB. By learning only the spectral coefficients of rapidly decaying eigenvalues, SFO achieves a highly efficient representation. Across six benchmarks, including reaction-diffusion, fluid dynamics, and 3D electromagnetics, SFO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing error by up to 40% relative to strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b97\u5b50(SFO)\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e40%\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u89e3\u6620\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u3001\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SFO\uff0c\u7528\u901a\u7528\u8c31\u57fa(USB)\u5bf9\u79ef\u5206\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u79bb\u6563\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u5728USB\u4e2d\u6709\u7d27\u51d1\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSFO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "SFO\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u6620\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u3001\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

The centralization of security monitoring architectures creates serious latency issues that savvy attackers can exploit to compromise an entire manufacturing ecosystem. This paper outlines a new, decentralized multi-agent swarm (DMAS) architecture that includes autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents at each edge gateway, functioning as a distributed digital \"immune system\" for IIoT networks. Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing. Additionally, the proposed architecture can prevent real-time cascading failures in industrial control systems and reduce network bandwidth use by 89% compared to cloud-based solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eIIoT\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\uff08DMAS\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7ebf\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6613\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDMAS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u5173\u8bbe\u7f6e\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u7b49\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u4fe1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08CVT\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df2000\u4e2aIIoT\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cDMAS\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4e9a\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\uff08\u5e73\u57470.85ms\uff09\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u6d3b\u52a8\u51c6\u786e\u738797.3%\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u51c6\u786e\u738787%\uff0c\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u51cf\u5c1189%\u7f51\u7edc\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "DMAS\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u969cIIoT\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

These exposes highlight the need to identify when algorithms predict unintended quantities - ideally before deploying them into consequential settings. We propose a falsification framework that provides a principled statistical test for discriminant validity: the requirement that an algorithm predict intended outcomes better than impermissible ones. Drawing on falsification practices from causal inference, econometrics, and psychometrics, our framework compares calibrated prediction losses across outcomes to assess whether the algorithm exhibits discriminant validity with respect to a specified impermissible proxy. In settings where the target outcome is difficult to observe, multiple permissible proxy outcomes may be available; our framework accommodates both this setting and the case with a single permissible proxy. Throughout we use nonparametric hypothesis testing methods that make minimal assumptions on the data-generating process. We illustrate the method in an admissions setting, where the framework establishes discriminant validity with respect to gender but fails to establish discriminant validity with respect to race. This demonstrates how falsification can serve as an early validity check, prior to fairness or robustness analyses. We also provide analysis in a criminal justice setting, where we highlight the limitations of our framework and emphasize the need for complementary approaches to assess other aspects of construct validity and external validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u6548\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u62db\u751f\u548c\u5211\u4e8b\u53f8\u6cd5\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e38\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u9884\u671f\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u8bc1\u4f2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6821\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u522b\u6548\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u62db\u751f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6548\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u65b9\u9762\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5728\u5211\u4e8b\u53f8\u6cd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u4f2a\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6216\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\u524d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods optimize standard next-token likelihood and implicitly treat all tokens as equally informative, which is misaligned with semantic-ID-based generation. Accordingly, we propose two complementary information-gain-based token-weighting strategies tailored to generative recommendation with semantic IDs. Front-Greater Weighting captures conditional semantic information gain by prioritizing early tokens that most effectively reduce candidate-item uncertainty given their prefixes and encode coarse semantics. Frequency Weighting models marginal information gain under long-tailed item and token distributions, upweighting rare tokens to counteract popularity bias. Beyond individual strategies, we introduce a multi-target learning framework with curriculum learning that jointly optimizes the two token-weighted objectives alongside standard likelihood, enabling stable optimization and adaptive emphasis across training stages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines and existing token-weighting approaches, with improved robustness, strong generalization across different semantic-ID constructions, and substantial gains on both head and tail items.

The standard trial-and-error approach to find feasible parameter configurations is highly inefficient because validating each configuration is expensive in terms of resources (physical and human labor) and the configuration space is very large. This paper combines the general principles of AI-driven adaptive experimental design with domain knowledge to address the challenging problem of discovering feasible configurations. The key idea is to build a surrogate model from past experiments to intelligently select a small batch of input configurations for validation in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success.

At the time of publication, ROCKET was on par with the best state-of-the-art algorithms for TSC in terms of accuracy while being significantly less computationally expensive, making ROCKET a compelling algorithm for TSC.

In this work, we demonstrate that: (1) prefetching and off-chip prediction often provide complementary performance benefits, yet (2) naively combining them often fails to realize their full performance potential, and (3) existing prefetcher control policies leave significant room for performance improvement behind.\n  Our goal is to design a holistic framework that can autonomously learn to coordinate an off-chip predictor with multiple prefetchers employed at various cache levels. To this end, we propose a new technique called Athena, which models the coordination between prefetchers and off-chip predictor (OCP) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Athena acts as the RL agent that observes multiple system-level features (e.g., prefetcher/OCP accuracy, bandwidth usage) over an epoch of program execution, and uses them as state information to select a coordination action (i.e., enabling the prefetcher and/or OCP, and adjusting prefetcher aggressiveness). At the end of every epoch, Athena receives a numerical reward that measures the change in multiple system-level metrics (e.g., number of cycles taken to execute an epoch). Athena uses this reward to autonomously and continuously learn a policy to coordinate prefetchers with OCP.\n  Our extensive evaluation using a diverse set of memory-intensive workloads shows that Athena consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art coordination policies across a wide range of system configurations with various combinations of underlying prefetchers, OCPs, and main memory bandwidths, while incurring only modest storage overhead.

This paper presents a unified and complete Kantorovich duality theory for MOT problem on general Polish product spaces with bounded continuous cost function. For marginal compact spaces, the duality identity is derived through a convex-analytic reformulation, that identifies the dual problem as a Fenchel-Rockafellar conjugate. We obtain dual attainment and show that optimal potentials may always be chosen in the class of $c$-conjugate families, thereby extending classical two-marginal conjugacy principle into a genuinely multimarginal setting. In non-compact setting, where direct compactness arguments are unavailable, we recover duality via a truncation-tightness procedure based on weak compactness of multimarginal transference plans and boundedness of the cost. We prove that the dual value is preserved under restriction to compact subsets and that admissible dual families can be regularized into uniformly bounded $c$-conjugate potentials. The argument relies on a refined use of $c$-splitting sets and their equivalence with multimarginal $c$-cyclical monotonicity. We then obtain dual attainment and exact primal-dual equality for MOT on arbitrary Polish spaces, together with a canonical representation of optimal dual potentials by $c$-conjugacy.

However, models that demonstrate scaling laws are actually challenging to deploy in industrial settings for modeling long sequences of user behaviors, due to the high computational complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. Despite various sparse self-attention mechanisms proposed in other fields, they are not fully suited for recommendation scenarios. This is because user behaviors exhibit personalization and temporal characteristics: different users have distinct behavior patterns, and these patterns change over time, with data from these users differing significantly from data in other fields in terms of distribution. To address these challenges, we propose SparseCTR, an efficient and effective model specifically designed for long-term behaviors of users. To be precise, we first segment behavior sequences into chunks in a personalized manner to avoid separating continuous behaviors and enable parallel processing of sequences. Based on these chunks, we propose a three-branch sparse self-attention mechanism to jointly identify users' global interests, interest transitions, and short-term interests. Furthermore, we design a composite relative temporal encoding via learnable, head-specific bias coefficients, better capturing sequential and periodic relationships among user behaviors. Extensive experimental results show that SparseCTR not only improves efficiency but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

In realistic project-level repair scenarios, software repositories often span millions of tokens, far exceeding current LLM context limits. Consequently, models must first identify a small, relevant subset of code, making accurate FL essential for effective repair. We present a novel project-level FL approach that improves both file- and element-level localization. Our method introduces a hierarchical reasoning module that (i) generates structured, bug-specific explanations for candidate files and elements, and (ii) leverages these explanations in a two-stage ranking scheme combining LLM-based and embedding-based signals. We further propose a counterfactual upper-bound analysis to quantify the contribution of each localization stage to repair success. We evaluate our approach on Python and Java projects from SWE-bench Verified, Lite, and Java. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including Agentless and OpenHands, our method consistently improves localization accuracy. On SWE-bench Verified, file-level Hit@1 improves from 71.4% to 85%, and MRR from 81.8% to 88.8%. At the element level, Exact Match under top-3 files increases from 36% to 69%.

Analyzing a range of CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Vision-Language Models using both in-distribution (ImageNetV2) and out-of-distribution (CIFAR-10) testbeds, our initial findings suggest that: (1) architectural family is a primary determinant of representational similarity, forming distinct clusters; (2) CKA self-similarity and task accuracy are strongly correlated during pruning, though accuracy often degrades more sharply; and (3) for some model pairs, pruning appears to regularize representations, exposing a shared computational core.

A large body of prior SSD-based NDP techniques operate in isolation, mapping computations to only one or two NDP paradigms (i.e., ISP, PuD-SSD, or IFP) within the SSD. These techniques (1) are tailored to specific workloads or kernels, (2) do not exploit the full computational potential of an SSD, and (3) lack programmer-transparency. While several prior works propose techniques to partition computation between the host and near-memory accelerators, adapting these techniques to SSDs has limited benefits because they (1) ignore the heterogeneity of the SSD resources, and (2) make offloading decisions based on limited factors such as bandwidth utilization, or data movement cost. We propose Conduit, a general-purpose, programmer-transparent NDP framework for SSDs that leverages multiple SSD computation resources. At compile time, Conduit executes a custom compiler (e.g., LLVM) pass that (i) vectorizes suitable application code segments into SIMD operations that align with the SSD's page layout, and (ii) embeds metadata (e.g., operation type, operand sizes) into the vectorized instructions to guide runtime offloading decisions. At runtime, within the SSD, Conduit performs instruction-granularity offloading by evaluating six key features, and uses a cost function to select the most suitable SSD resource. We evaluate Conduit and two prior NDP offloading techniques using an in-house event-driven SSD simulator on six data-intensive workloads.

Denoising has been proposed as a method for removing noisy implicit feedback and improving recommendations. Prior work has focused on in-training denoising, however this requires additional data, changes to the model architecture and training procedure or fine-tuning, all of which can be costly and data hungry. In this work, we focus on post-training denoising. Different from in-training denoising, post-training denoising does not involve changing the architecture of the model nor its training procedure, and does not require additional data. Specifically, we present a method for post-training denoising user profiles using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations. Our approach prompts LLMs with (i) a user profile (user interactions), (ii) a candidate item, and (iii) its rank as given by the CF recommender, and asks the LLM to remove items from the user profile to improve the rank of the candidate item. Experiments with a state-of-the-art CF recommender and 4 open and closed source LLMs in 3 datasets show that our denoising yields improvements up to 13% in effectiveness over the original user profiles.

We introduce \\textbf{Health-ORSC-Bench}, the first large-scale benchmark designed to systematically measure \\textbf{Over-Refusal} and \\textbf{Safe Completion} quality in healthcare. Comprising 31,920 benign boundary prompts across seven health categories (e.g., self-harm, medical misinformation), our framework uses an automated pipeline with human validation to test models at varying levels of intent ambiguity.

Our findings demonstrate that model family and size significantly influence calibration: larger frontier models (e.g., GPT-5, Llama-4) exhibit \"safety-pessimism\" and higher over-refusal than smaller or MoE-based counterparts (e.g., Qwen-3-Next), highlighting that current LLMs struggle to balance refusal and compliance.

We introduce TAM-Eval (Test Automated Maintenance Evaluation), a framework and benchmark designed to evaluate model performance across three core test maintenance scenarios: creation, repair, and updating of test suites. Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing.

Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration.

In many modern applications, auxiliary covariates are collected alongside responses and encode information about the same latent structure. Traditional approaches to incorporating such covariates typically rely on fully specified joint likelihoods, which are computationally intensive and sensitive to misspecification. We introduce a covariate-assisted grade of membership model that integrates response and covariate information by exploiting their shared low-rank simplex geometry, rather than modeling their joint distribution. We propose a likelihood-free spectral estimation procedure that combines heterogeneous data sources through a balance parameter controlling their relative contribution. To accommodate high-dimensional and heteroskedastic noise, we employ heteroskedastic principal component analysis before performing simplex-based geometric recovery. Our theoretical analysis establishes weaker identifiability conditions than those required in the covariate-free model, and further derives finite-sample, entrywise error bounds for both mixed membership scores and item parameters. These results demonstrate that auxiliary covariates can provably improve latent structure recovery, yielding faster convergence rates in high-dimensional regimes. Simulation studies and an application to educational assessment data illustrate the computational efficiency, statistical accuracy, and interpretability gains of the proposed method.

Yet they fall short of traditional recommenders when capturing complex preference patterns. Recent works have tried integrating traditional recommendation embeddings into LLMs to resolve this issue, yet a core gap persists between their continuous embedding and discrete semantic spaces. Intuitively, textual attributes derived from interactions can serve as critical preference rationales for LLMs' recommendation logic. However, directly inputting such attribute knowledge presents two core challenges: (1) Deficiency of sparse interactions in reflecting preference hints for unseen items; (2) Substantial noise introduction from treating all attributes as hints. To this end, we propose a preference hint discovery model based on the interaction-integrated knowledge graph, enhancing LLM-based recommendation. It utilizes traditional recommendation principles to selectively extract crucial attributes as hints. Specifically, we design a collaborative preference hint extraction schema, which utilizes semantic knowledge from similar users' explicit interactions as hints for unseen items. Furthermore, we develop an instance-wise dual-attention mechanism to quantify the preference credibility of candidate attributes, identifying hints specific to each unseen item. Using these item- and user-based hints, we adopt a flattened hint organization method to shorten input length and feed the textual hint information to the LLM for commonsense reasoning.

Adoption of Coding Agents on GitHub", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "In the first half of 2025, coding agents have emerged as a category of development tools that have very quickly transitioned to the practice. Unlike ''traditional'' code completion LLMs such as Copilot, agents like Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex operate with high degrees of autonomy, up to generating complete pull requests starting from a developer-provided task description. This new mode of operation is poised to change the landscape in an even larger way than code completion LLMs did, making the need to study their impact critical. Also, unlike traditional LLMs, coding agents tend to leave more explicit traces in software engineering artifacts, such as co-authoring commits or pull requests. We leverage these traces to present the first large-scale study (129,134 projects) of the adoption of coding agents on GitHub, finding an estimated adoption rate of 15.85%--22.60%, which is very high for a technology only a few months old--and increasing. We carry out an in-depth study of the adopters we identified, finding that adoption is broad: it spans the entire spectrum of project maturity; it includes established organizations; and it concerns diverse programming languages or project topics. At the commit level, we find that commits assisted by coding agents are larger than commits only authored by human developers, and have a large proportion of features and bug fixes. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the practical use of coding agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9Github\u4e0a\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u4ea4\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u4e14\u542b\u8f83\u591a\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee5\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6bd4\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168LLMs\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u6539\u53d8\u884c\u4e1a\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u4e14\u4f1a\u7559\u4e0b\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7559\u4e0b\u7684\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u5bf9Github\u4e0a129,134\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u572815.85% - 22.60%\u4e14\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5355\u72ec\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning.

Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships.

Although reasoning prompting can enhance ranking utility, our preliminary exploration reveals that its benefits are inconsistent and come at a substantial computational cost, suggesting that when to reason is as crucial as how to reason. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning routing framework that employs a lightweight, plug-and-play router head to decide whether to use direct inference (Non-Think) or reasoning (Think) for each instance before generation. The router head relies solely on pre-generation signals: i) compact ranking-aware features (e.g., candidate dispersion) and ii) model-aware difficulty signals derived from a diagnostic checklist reflecting the model's estimated need for reasoning. By leveraging these features before generation, the router outputs a controllable token that determines whether to apply the Think mode. Furthermore, the router can adaptively select its operating policy along the validation Pareto frontier during deployment, enabling dynamic allocation of computational resources toward instances most likely to benefit from Think under varying system constraints. Experiments on three public ranking datasets with different scales of open-source LLMs show consistent improvements in ranking utility with reduced token consumption (e.g., +6.3\\% NDCG@10 with -49.5\\% tokens on MovieLens with Qwen3-4B), demonstrating reasoning routing as a practical solution to the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u76ca\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u540d\u6548\u7528\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u76ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4f55\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5934\u4f9d\u636e\u9884\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u6392\u540d\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u96be\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f7f\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u8def\u7531\u5934\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6392\u540d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6392\u540d\u6548\u7528\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982\u5728MovieLens\u4e0aQwen3 - 4B\u6a21\u578b\u7684NDCG@10\u63d0\u53476.3%\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c1149.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u7531\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6027 - \u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods.

However, this metric is inherently retrospective, reflecting only the past 90 days of activity and providing no insight into future maintenance, which limits its usefulness for proactive risk assessment. In this paper, we study to what extent future maintenance activity, as captured by the OpenSSF Maintained score, can be forecasted. We analyze 3,220 GitHub repositories associated with the top 1% most central PyPI libraries by PageRank and reconstruct historical Maintained scores over a three-year period. We formulate the task as multivariate time series forecasting and consider four target representations: raw scores, bucketed maintenance levels, numerical trend slopes, and categorical trend types. We compare a statistical model (VARMA), a machine learning model (Random Forest), and a deep learning model (LSTM) across training windows of 3-12 months and forecasting horizons of 1-6 months. Our results show that future maintenance activity can be predicted with meaningful accuracy, particularly for aggregated representations such as bucketed scores and trend types, achieving accuracies above 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Simpler statistical and machine learning models perform on par with deep learning approaches, indicating that complex architectures are not required.

Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b.

At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.\n  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism.

Such flattening disrupts logical and spatial dependencies - such as section organization, figure-text correspondence, and cross-reference relations, that humans naturally exploit for comprehension. To address this limitation, we introduce a document-level structural Document MAP (DMAP), which explicitly encodes both hierarchical organization and inter-element relationships within multimodal documents. Specifically, we design a Structured-Semantic Understanding Agent to construct DMAP by organizing textual content together with figures, tables, charts, etc. into a human-aligned hierarchical schema that captures both semantic and layout dependencies. Building upon this representation, a Reflective Reasoning Agent performs structure-aware and evidence-driven reasoning, dynamically assessing the sufficiency of retrieved context and iteratively refining answers through targeted interactions with DMAP. Extensive experiments on MMDocQA benchmarks demonstrate that DMAP yields document-specific structural representations aligned with human interpretive patterns, substantially enhancing retrieval precision, reasoning consistency, and multimodal comprehension over conventional RAG-based approaches.

By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration.

Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation.

We focus on the challenging FSCIL setup where a model receives only a single sample (1-shot) for each novel class and no further training or model alterations are allowed after the base training phase. This makes generalization to novel classes particularly difficult. We propose a novel approach predicated on the hypothesis that base and novel class embeddings have structural similarity. We map the original embedding space into a residual space by subtracting the class prototype (i.e., the average class embedding) of input samples. Then, we leverage generative modeling with VAE or diffusion models to learn the multi-modal distribution of residuals over the base classes, and we use this as a valuable structural prior to improve recognition of novel classes.

However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories.

However, existing benchmarks predominantly target consumer-oriented scenarios (e.g., e-commerce and travel booking), failing to capture the complexity and rigor of professional enterprise workflows. Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents.

However, their use in sensitive applications has raised concerns about the potential leakage of training data. Research on privacy leakage in GNNs has largely been shaped by findings from non-graph domains, such as images and tabular data. We emphasize the need of graph specific analysis and investigate the impact of graph structure on node level membership inference. We formalize MI over node-neighbourhood tuples and investigate two important dimensions: (i) training graph construction and (ii) inference-time edge access. Empirically, snowball's coverage bias often harms generalisation relative to random sampling, while enabling inter-train-test edges at inference improves test accuracy, shrinks the train-test gap, and yields the lowest membership advantage across most of the models and datasets. We further show that the generalisation gap empirically measured as the performance difference between the train and test nodes is an incomplete proxy for MI risk: access to edges dominates-MI can rise or fall independent of gap changes. Finally, we examine the auditability of differentially private GNNs, adapting the definition of statistical exchangeability of train-test data points for graph based models.

Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type.\n  The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI).

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $\u03c7^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all.

Despite notable progress in modeling user preferences from historical behaviors, two key challenges persist. First, exsiting discriminative paradigms focus on matching candidates to user history, often overfitting to historically dominant features and failing to adapt to rapid interest shifts. Second, a critical information chasm emerges from the point-wise ranking paradigm. By scoring each candidate in isolation, CTR models discard the rich contextual signal implied by the recalled set as a whole, leading to a misalignment where long-term preferences often override the user's immediate, evolving intent. To address these issues, we propose GenCI, a generative user intent framework that leverages semantic interest cohorts to model dynamic user preferences for CTR prediction. The framework first employs a generative model, trained with a next-item prediction (NTP) objective, to proactively produce candidate interest cohorts. These cohorts serve as explicit, candidate-agnostic representations of a user's immediate intent. A hierarchical candidate-aware network then injects this rich contextual signal into the ranking stage, refining them with cross-attention to align with both user history and the target item.

However, generating such features is challenging: it requires reasoning over complex schemas and exploring a combinatorially large feature space, all without explicit supervision. To address these challenges, we propose ReFuGe, an agentic framework that leverages specialized large language model agents: (1) a schema selection agent identifies the tables and columns relevant to the task, (2) a feature generation agent produces diverse candidate features from the selected schema, and (3) a feature filtering agent evaluates and retains promising features through reasoning-based and validation-based filtering. It operates within an iterative feedback loop until performance converges. Experiments on RDB benchmarks demonstrate that ReFuGe substantially improves performance on various RDB prediction tasks.

In this literature, computational experiments are the main means of evaluation, and the credibility of results depends on experimental design and reporting. Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by Gonz\u00e1lez Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited.

In this work, we introduce a blockchain-backed provenance architecture for streaming platform (e.g Kafka Streams) the publishes cryptographic data of a windowed data stream without publishing window payloads on-chain. We used real-time weather data from weather stations in Berlin. Weather records are canonicalized, deduplicated, and aggregated per window, then serialised deterministically. Furthermore, the Merkle root of the records within the window is computed and stored alongside with Kafka offsets boundaries to MultiChain blockchain streams as checkpoints. Our design can enable an independent auditor to verify: (1) the completeness of window payloads, (2) canonical serialization, and (3) correctness of derived analytics such as minimum/maximum/average temperatures. We evaluated our system using real data stream from two weather stations (Berlin-Brandenburg and Berlin-Tempelhof) and showed linear verification cost, deterministic reproducibility, and with a scalable off-chain storage with on-chain cryptographic anchoring.

We introduce ADORE (Adaptive Deep Orchestration for Research in Enterprise), an agentic framework that replaces linear retrieval with iterative, user-steered investigation coordinated by a central orchestrator and a set of specialized agents. ADORE's key insight is that a structured Memory Bank (a curated evidence store with explicit claim-evidence linkage and section-level admissible evidence) enables traceable report generation and systematic checks for evidence completeness. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Memory-locked synthesis - report generation is constrained to a structured Memory Bank (Claim-Evidence Graph) with section-level admissible evidence, enabling traceable claims and grounded citations; (2) Evidence-coverage-guided execution - a retrieval-reflection loop audits section-level evidence coverage to trigger targeted follow-up retrieval and terminates via an evidence-driven stopping criterion; (3) Section-packed long-context grounding - section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form synthesis feasible under context limits.

We present ConceptACT, an extension of Action Chunking with Transformers that leverages episode-level semantic concept annotations during training to improve learning efficiency. Unlike language-conditioned approaches that require semantic input at deployment, ConceptACT uses human-provided concepts (object properties, spatial relationships, task constraints) exclusively during demonstration collection, adding minimal annotation burden. We integrate concepts using a modified transformer architecture in which the final encoder layer implements concept-aware cross-attention, supervised to align with human annotations.

Such powerful ransomware variants, privilege-escalated evasive ransomware (PEER), can defeat existing solutions relying on I/O-pattern analysis by tampering with or obfuscating I/O traces. Meanwhile, conventional statistical content-based detection becomes unreliable as the encryption size decreases due to sampling noises. We present Rhea, a cloud-offloaded ransomware defense system that analyzes replicated data snapshots, so-called mutation snapshots. Rhea introduces Format-Aware Validation that validates the syntactic and semantic correctness of file formats, instead of relying on statistical or entropy-based indicators. By leveraging file-format specifications as detection invariants, Rhea can reliably identify fine-grained and evasive encryption even under elevated attacker privileges.

The architecture of an RS model acts as an inductive bias, shaping the patterns the model is inclined to learn. In recent years, numerous recommendation architectures have emerged, spanning traditional matrix factorization, deep neural networks, and graph neural networks. However, their designs are often not explicitly aligned with the top-K objective, thereby limiting their effectiveness.\n  To address this limitation, we propose TopKGAT, a novel recommendation architecture directly derived from a differentiable approximation of top-K metrics. The forward computation of a single TopKGAT layer is intrinsically aligned with the gradient ascent dynamics of the Precision@K metric, enabling the model to naturally improve top-K recommendation accuracy. Structurally, TopKGAT resembles a graph attention network and can be implemented efficiently.

Traditional predictive models often struggle to generalize across heterogeneous datasets and complex physiological patterns.

This approach combines the representational power of deep networks with the interpretability and efficiency of traditional models. Experiments on two publicly available Kaggle datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance, reaching 82.30 percent accuracy on Dataset I and 97.10 percent on Dataset II, with consistent gains in precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings underscore the robustness and clinical potential of hybrid AI frameworks for predicting cardiovascular disease and facilitating early intervention.

An Empirical Characterization", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Machine Learning (ML) Operations (MLOps) frameworks have been conceived to support developers and AI engineers in managing the lifecycle of their ML models. While such frameworks provide a wide range of features, developers may leverage only a subset of them, while missing some highly desired features. This paper investigates the practical use and desired feature enhancements of eight popular open-source MLOps frameworks. Specifically, we analyze their usage by dependent projects on GitHub, examining how they invoke the frameworks' APIs and commands. Then, we qualitatively analyze feature requests and enhancements mined from the frameworks' issue trackers, relating these desired improvements to the previously identified usage features. Results indicate that MLOps frameworks are rarely used out-of-the-box and are infrequently integrated into GitHub Workflows, but rather, developers use their APIs to implement custom functionality in their projects.

Through an analysis of numerical uncertainty of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we observe that many operations are applied to values dominated by numerical noise and have negligible influence on model outputs. In some models, up to two-thirds of convolution operations appear redundant. We introduce Conservative & Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance.

By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the \"fidelity cliffs\" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes.

However, existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle to effectively incorporate collaborative filtering (CF) signals, due to a fundamental mismatch between item-level preference modeling in CF and token-level next-token prediction (NTP) optimization in LLMs. Prior approaches typically treat CF as contextual hints or representation bias, and resort to multi-stage training to reduce behavioral semantic space discrepancies, leaving CF unable to explicitly regulate LLM generation. In this work, we propose Token-level Collaborative Alignment for Recommendation (TCA4Rec), a model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework that establishes an explicit optimization-level interface between CF supervision and LLM generation. TCA4Rec consists of (i) Collaborative Tokenizer, which projects raw item-level CF logits into token-level distributions aligned with the LLM token space, and (ii) Soft Label Alignment, which integrates these CF-informed distributions with one-hot supervision to optimize a soft NTP objective. This design preserves the generative nature of LLM training while enabling collaborative alignment with essential user preference of CF models. We highlight TCA4Rec is compatible with arbitrary traditional CF models and generalizes across a wide range of decoder-based LLM recommender architectures. Moreover, it provides an explicit mechanism to balance behavioral alignment and semantic fluency, yielding generative recommendations that are both accurate and controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA4Rec consistently improves recommendation performance across a broad spectrum of CF models and LLM-based recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u878d\u5165\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTCA4Rec\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5165\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ba9\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u660e\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTCA4Rec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u534f\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "TCA4Rec\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTCA4Rec\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6 NSVIF\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LLM \u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4e14\u8fdd\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\u96be\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u6b64\u7c7b\u8fdd\u89c4\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e8b\u6545\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa NSVIF \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1 VIFBENCH \u8bc4\u4f30 NSVIF\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e NSVIF \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e LLM \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "NSVIF \u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8 LLM \u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments.

To aid such decisions, we propose a diagnostic tool for contrasting global regression models and patient-specific (local) regression models. The core utility of this tool is to identify where and for whom a global model may be inadequate. We focus on regression models and specifically suggest a localized regression approach that identifies regions in the predictor space where patients are not well represented by the global model. As localization becomes challenging when dealing with many predictors, we propose modeling in a dimension-reduced latent representation obtained from an autoencoder. Using such a neural network architecture for dimension reduction enables learning a latent representation simultaneously optimized for both good data reconstruction and for revealing local outcome-related associations suitable for robust localized regression. We illustrate the proposed approach with a clinical study involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our findings indicate that the global model is adequate for most patients but that indeed specific subgroups benefit from personalized models. We also demonstrate how to map these subgroup models back to the original predictors, providing insight into why the global model falls short for these groups. Thus, the principal application and diagnostic yield of our tool is the identification and characterization of patients or subgroups whose outcome associations deviate from the global model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u964d\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u6216\u4e9a\u7ec4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u672c\u5730\u5316\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u4e9a\u7ec4\u4ece\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u4e9a\u7ec4\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u5173\u8054\u504f\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u6216\u4e9a\u7ec4\u3002"}}

However, existing methods follow an ID-indexed communication paradigm that transmit whole item embeddings between clients and the server, which has three major limitations: 1) consumes uncontrollable communication resources, 2) the uploaded item information cannot generalize to related non-interacted items, and 3) is sensitive to client noisy feedback. To solve these problems, it is necessary to fundamentally change the existing ID-indexed communication paradigm. Therefore, we propose a feature-indexed communication paradigm that transmits feature code embeddings as codebooks rather than raw item embeddings. Building on this paradigm, we present RQFedRec, which assigns each item a list of discrete code IDs via Residual Quantization (RQ)-Kmeans. Each client generates and trains code embeddings as codebooks based on discrete code IDs provided by the server, and the server collects and aggregates these codebooks rather than item embeddings. This design makes communication controllable since the codebooks could cover all items, enabling updates to propagate across related items in same code ID. In addition, since code embedding represents many items, which is more robust to a single noisy item. To jointly capture semantic and collaborative information, RQFedRec further adopts a collaborative-semantic dual-channel aggregation with a curriculum strategy that emphasizes semantic codes early and gradually increases the contribution of collaborative codes over training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that RQFedRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated recommendation baselines while significantly reducing communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684ID\u7d22\u5f15\u901a\u4fe1\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u7d22\u5f15\u901a\u4fe1\u8303\u5f0f\u53caRQFedRec\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u7684ID\u7d22\u5f15\u901a\u4fe1\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u6d88\u8017\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u7d22\u5f15\u901a\u4fe1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efaRQFedRec\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316Kmeans\u5206\u914d\u79bb\u6563\u4ee3\u7801ID\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u534f\u4f5c - \u8bed\u4e49\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRQFedRec\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "RQFedRec\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment.

We prove an oracle inequality for the population penalized risk and a localization guarantee showing that each true change point is recovered within a window that is small relative to segment length. To connect theory to practice, we introduce an LLM-based simulation framework that generates synthetic documents with controlled finite-memory dependence and known boundaries, validating the predicted scaling behavior.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability.

We introduce a non-invasive, uncertainty-aware framework for estimating coronary flow reserve (CFR) directly from standard angiography. The system integrates physics-informed neural networks with variational inference to infer coronary blood flow from first-principles models of contrast transport, without requiring ground-truth flow measurements. The pipeline runs in approximately three minutes per patient on a single GPU, with no population-level training.\n  Using 1{,}000 synthetic spatiotemporal intensity maps (kymographs) with controlled noise and artifacts, the framework reliably identifies degraded data and outputs appropriately inflated uncertainty estimates, showing strong correspondence between predictive uncertainty and error (Pearson $r = 0.997$, Spearman $\u03c1= 0.998$). Clinical validation in 12 patients shows strong agreement between PUNCH-derived CFR and invasive bolus thermodilution (Pearson $r = 0.90$, $p = 6.3 \\times 10^{-5}$). We focus on the LAD, the artery most commonly assessed in routine CMD testing. Probabilistic CFR estimates have confidence intervals narrower than the variability of repeated invasive measurements.\n  By transforming routine angiography into quantitative, uncertainty-aware assessment, this approach enables scalable, safer, and more reproducible evaluation of coronary microvascular function.

However, existing GR methods primarily focus on direct Semantic ID (SID) generation from interaction sequences, failing to activate deeper reasoning capabilities analogous to those in large language models and thus limiting performance potential. We identify two critical limitations in current reasoning-enhanced GR approaches: (1) Strict sequential separation between reasoning and generation steps creates imbalanced computational focus across hierarchical SID codes, degrading quality for SID codes; (2) Generated reasoning vectors lack interpretable semantics, while reasoning paths suffer from unverifiable supervision. In this paper, we propose stepwise semantic-guided reasoning in latent space (S$^2$GR), a novel reasoning enhanced GR framework. First, we establish a robust semantic foundation via codebook optimization, integrating item co-occurrence relationship to capture behavioral patterns, and load balancing and uniformity objectives that maximize codebook utilization while reinforcing coarse-to-fine semantic hierarchies. Our core innovation introduces the stepwise reasoning mechanism inserting thinking tokens before each SID generation step, where each token explicitly represents coarse-grained semantics supervised via contrastive learning against ground-truth codebook cluster distributions ensuring physically grounded reasoning paths and balanced computational focus across all SID codes.

However, most work on personalized agents prioritizes utility and user experience, treating memory as a neutral component and largely overlooking its safety implications. In this paper, we reveal intent legitimation, a previously underexplored safety failure in personalized agents, where benign personal memories bias intent inference and cause models to legitimize inherently harmful queries. To study this phenomenon, we introduce PS-Bench, a benchmark designed to identify and quantify intent legitimation in personalized interactions. Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines. We further provide mechanistic evidence for intent legitimation from internal representations space, and propose a lightweight detection-reflection method that effectively reduces safety degradation. Overall, our work provides the first systematic exploration and evaluation of intent legitimation as a safety failure mode that naturally arises from benign, real-world personalization, highlighting the importance of assessing safety under long-term personal context.

However, existing interpretability methods remain limited in explaining how cognitive abilities are engaged during LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose UniCog, a unified framework that analyzes LLM cognition via a latent mind space. Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics. Finally, leveraging these insights, we introduce a latent-informed candidate prioritization strategy, which improves reasoning performance by up to 7.5% across challenging benchmarks.

Rather than enforcing governing equations and boundary conditions through residual-based loss terms, NewPINNs integrates the solver directly into the training loop and defines learning objectives through solver-consistency. The neural network produces candidate solution states that are advanced by the numerical solver, and training minimizes the discrepancy between the network prediction and the solver-evolved state. This pull-push interaction enables the network to learn physically admissible solutions through repeated exposure to the solver's action, without requiring problem-specific loss engineering or explicit evaluation of differential equation residuals. By delegating the enforcement of physics, boundary conditions, and numerical stability to established numerical solvers, NewPINNs mitigates several well-known failure modes of standard physics-informed neural networks, including optimization pathologies, sensitivity to loss weighting, and poor performance in stiff or nonlinear regimes.

When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data. We evaluate PEARL under controlled label regimes ranging from extreme label scarcity to higher-label settings. In the label-scarce condition, PEARL substantially improves local neighborhood quality, yielding 25.7% gains over raw embeddings and more than 21.1% gains relative to strong unsupervised post-processing, precisely in the regime where similarity-based systems are most brittle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPEARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd1\u90bb\u5bf9\u5e94\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd1\u90bb\u5bf9\u5e94\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPEARL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u4f7f\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\u8f6f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u91cd\u5851\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPEARL\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u534725.7%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5f3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u540e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u8d8521.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "PEARL\u80fd\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.\n  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8c03\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEoG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728ITBench\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc1\u636e\u6316\u6398\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\u5931\u8d25\uff0cReAct-style\u4ee3\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEoG\u6846\u67b6\uff0cLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u6316\u6398\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u904d\u5386\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728ITBench\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEoG\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cMajority - at - k\u5b9e\u4f53F1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EoG\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8c03\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684ReAct-style\u4ee3\u7406\u3002"}}

Unlike prior approaches that are often tailored to specific deployment regimes, JetFormer is designed to operate effectively across the full spectrum of jet tagging scenarios, from high-accuracy offline analysis to ultra-low-latency online triggering. The model processes variable-length sets of particle features without relying on input of explicit pairwise interactions, yet achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. On the large-scale JetClass dataset, a large-scale JetFormer matches the accuracy of the interaction-rich ParT model (within 0.7%) while using 37.4% fewer FLOPs, demonstrating its computational efficiency and strong generalization. On benchmark HLS4ML 150P datasets, JetFormer consistently outperforms existing models such as MLPs, Deep Sets, and Interaction Networks by 3-4% in accuracy. To bridge the gap to hardware deployment, we further introduce a hardware-aware optimization pipeline based on multi-objective hyperparameter search, yielding compact variants like JetFormer-tiny suitable for FPGA-based trigger systems with sub-microsecond latency requirements. Through structured pruning and quantization, we show that JetFormer can be aggressively compressed with minimal accuracy loss. By unifying high-performance modeling and deployability within a single architectural framework, JetFormer provides a practical pathway for deploying Transformer-based jet taggers in both offline and online environments at the LHC.

State-of-the-art solutions are based on retrieval augmentation, where relevant context from a user profile is retrieved for LLM consumption. These methods deal with a trade-off between exposing retrieved private data to cloud providers and relying on less capable local models. We introduce $P^3$, an interactive framework for high-quality personalization without revealing private profiles to server-side LLMs. In $P^3$, a large server-side model generates a sequence of $k$ draft tokens based solely on the user query, while a small client-side model, with retrieval access to the user's private profile, evaluates and modifies these drafts to better reflect user preferences. This process repeats until an end token is generated. Experiments on LaMP-QA, a recent benchmark consisting of three personalized question answering datasets, show that $P^3$ consistently outperforms both non-personalized server-side and personalized client-side baselines, achieving statistically significant improvements of $7.4%$ to $9%$ on average. Importantly, $P^3$ recovers $90.3%$ to $95.7%$ of the utility of a ``leaky'' upper-bound scenario in which the full profile is exposed to the large server-side model. Privacy analyses, including linkability and attribute inference attacks, indicate that $P^3$ preserves the privacy of a non-personalized server-side model, introducing only marginal additional leakage ($1.5%$--$3.5%$) compared to submitting a query without any personal context. Additionally, the framework is efficient for edge deployment, with the client-side model generating only $9.2%$ of the total tokens.

The Conditional Diffusion Model-based Inverse Problem Solver (CDI) has previously demonstrated effective probabilistic inference for one-dimensional temporal signals, but its applicability to higher-dimensional spatial data remains unexplored. We extend CDI to two-dimensional spatial conditioning, enabling probabilistic parameter inference directly from spatial observations. We validate this extension on convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) parameter inference - a challenging multi-parameter inverse problem in materials characterization where sample geometry, electronic structure, and thermal properties must be extracted from 2D diffraction patterns. Using simulated CBED data with ground-truth parameters, we demonstrate that CDI produces well-calibrated posterior distributions that accurately reflect measurement constraints: tight distributions for well-determined quantities and appropriately broad distributions for ambiguous parameters. In contrast, standard regression methods - while appearing accurate on aggregate metrics - mask this underlying uncertainty by predicting training set means for poorly constrained parameters.

We investigate this in a challenging real-time control setting (Dark Souls III) by representing combat as a directed skill graph and training its components in a hierarchical curriculum. The resulting agent decomposes control into five reusable skills: camera control, target lock-on, movement, dodging, and a heal-attack decision policy, each optimized for a narrow responsibility. This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable.

In this paper, we study how segment length affects audio fingerprinting performance. We extend an existing neural fingerprinting architecture to adopt various segment lengths and evaluate retrieval accuracy across different segment lengths and query durations.

We instead treat $\u03b2$ as a control parameter and densely sweep it for three 7B open-weight families under a fixed DPO recipe. In Mistral, capability is sharply non-monotonic: aggregated logic-probe margins become positive only in a narrow band near $\u03b2\\approx 10^{-2}$ and revert outside it, with boundary points that are seed-sensitive. Across architectures under the same sweep, we observe qualitatively different response modes: sharp reorganization in Mistral, selective changes in Llama, and smooth trade-offs in Qwen.

However, existing ZO methods typically employ isotropic perturbations, neglecting the rich structural information available during the forward pass. In this paper, we identify a crucial link between gradient formation and activation structure: the gradient of a linear layer is confined to the subspace spanned by its input activations. Leveraging this insight, we propose Activation-Guided Zeroth-Order optimization (AGZO). Unlike prior methods, AGZO extracts a compact, activation-informed subspace on the fly during the forward pass and restricts perturbations to this low-rank subspace. We provide a theoretical framework showing that AGZO optimizes a subspace-smoothed objective and provably yields update directions with higher cosine similarity to the true gradient than isotropic baselines. Empirically, we evaluate AGZO on Qwen3 and Pangu models across various benchmarks.

When handling such complex tasks, existing agents manage context at the subtask level to overcome linear context accumulation and information loss.

To address this issue, this paper introduces Self-Manager, a parallel agent loop that enables asynchronous and concurrent execution. The main thread can create multiple subthreads, each with its own isolated context, and manage them iteratively through Thread Control Blocks, allowing for more focused and flexible parallel agent execution. To assess its effectiveness, we benchmark Self-Manager on DeepResearch Bench, where it consistently outperforms existing single-agent loop baselines across all metrics.

We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $\u03b1= -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence.

Our framework, termed constrained dual unrolling (CDU), comprises two coupled neural networks that jointly approximate the saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal network emulates an iterative optimizer that finds a stationary point of the Lagrangian for a given dual multiplier, sampled from an unknown distribution. The dual network generates trajectories towards the optimal multipliers across its layers while querying the primal network at each layer. Departing from standard unrolling, we induce DA dynamics by imposing primal-descent and dual-ascent constraints through constrained learning. We formulate training the two networks as a nested optimization problem and propose an alternating procedure that updates the primal and dual networks in turn, mitigating uncertainty in the multiplier distribution required for primal network training. We numerically evaluate the framework on mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) and power allocation in wireless networks.

Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) attempts to mitigate this by introducing a ``think-before-speak'' paradigm. However, applying RL directly in high-dimensional, discrete token spaces faces three inherent challenges: sample-inefficient rollouts, high gradient estimation variance, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To fundamentally address these structural bottlenecks, we propose \\textbf{DeepLatent Reasoning (DLR)}, a latent-space bidirectional contrastive reinforcement learning framework. This framework shifts the trial-and-error cost from expensive token-level full sequence generation to the continuous latent manifold. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight assistant model to efficiently sample $K$ reasoning chain encodings within the latent space. These encodings are filtered via a dual reward mechanism based on correctness and formatting; only high-value latent trajectories are fed into a \\textbf{frozen main model} for single-pass decoding. To maximize reasoning diversity while maintaining coherence, we design a contrastive learning objective to enable directed exploration within the latent space. Since the main model parameters remain frozen during optimization, this method mathematically eliminates catastrophic forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that under comparable GPU computational budgets, DLR achieves more stable training convergence, supports longer-horizon reasoning chains, and facilitates the sustainable accumulation of reasoning capabilities, providing a viable path toward reliable and scalable reinforcement learning for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeepLatent Reasoning (DLR) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u4e3a\u2018\u7edf\u8ba1\u62df\u5408\u2019\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u3001\u6613\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDLR\uff0c\u5c06\u8bd5\u9519\u6210\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4GPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cDLR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "conclusion": "DLR\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This is often difficult because a language embeds many dynamic and varied properties in its syntax, pragmatics and phonology, which need to be captured and processed. The capacity of computers to process natural languages is increasing because NLP researchers are pushing its boundaries. But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.\n  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants.

However, existing GAD methods follow a \"one model per dataset\" paradigm, leading to high computational costs, substantial data demands, and poor generalization when transferred to new datasets. This calls for a foundation model that enables a \"one-for-all\" GAD solution capable of detecting anomalies across diverse graphs without retraining. Yet, achieving this is challenging due to the large structural and feature heterogeneity across domains. In this paper, we propose TFM4GAD, a simple yet effective framework that adapts tabular foundation models (TFMs) for graph anomaly detection. Our key insight is that the core challenges of foundation GAD, handling heterogeneous features, generalizing across domains, and operating with scarce labels, are the exact problems that modern TFMs are designed to solve via synthetic pre-training and powerful in-context learning. The primary challenge thus becomes structural: TFMs are agnostic to graph topology. TFM4GAD bridges this gap by \"flattening\" the graph, constructing an augmented feature table that enriches raw node features with Laplacian embeddings, local and global structural characteristics, and anomaly-sensitive neighborhood aggregations. This augmented table is processed by a TFM in a fully in-context regime. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with various TFM backbones reveal that TFM4GAD surprisingly achieves significant performance gains over specialized GAD models trained from scratch.

We study deadline-aware control, where the aim is to reach a target temperature at a specified time while minimising energy consumption. We introduce an efficient Gymnasium environment that models an immersion hot water heater with first-order thermal losses and discrete on and off actions of 0 W and 6000 W applied every 120 seconds. Methods include a time-optimal bang-bang baseline, a zero-shot Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, and a Proximal Policy Optimisation policy. We report total energy consumption in watt-hours under identical physical dynamics. Across sweeps of initial temperature from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, deadline from 30 to 90 steps, and target temperature from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius, PPO achieves the most energy-efficient performance at a 60-step horizon of 2 hours, using 3.23 kilowatt-hours, compared to 4.37 to 10.45 kilowatt-hours for bang-bang control and 4.18 to 6.46 kilowatt-hours for MCTS. This corresponds to energy savings of 26 percent at 30 steps and 69 percent at 90 steps.

The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries.

To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency.

Nevertheless, most existing methods do not fully utilize these edge weights. Leveraging edge weights in graph clustering tasks faces two critical challenges. (1) The introduction of edge weights may significantly increase storage space and training time, making it essential to reduce the graph scale while preserving nodes that are beneficial for the clustering task. (2) Edge weight information may inherently contain noise that negatively impacts clustering results. However, few studies can jointly optimize clustering and edge weights, which is crucial for mitigating the negative impact of noisy edges on clustering task. To address these challenges, we propose a contractile edge-weight-aware graph clustering network.

An edge-weight-aware attention network is designed to identify and weaken noisy connections. In this way, we can more easily identify and mitigate the impact of noisy edges during the clustering process, thus enhancing clustering effectiveness.

At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B.

Specifically, the Fisher--Rao metric is the unique admissible geometry on belief space, and thermodynamically optimal regularization corresponds to minimizing squared Fisher--Rao distance to a reference state.\n  We derive the induced geometries for Gaussian and circular belief models, yielding hyperbolic and von Mises manifolds, respectively, and show that classical regularization schemes are structurally incapable of guaranteeing thermodynamic optimality.

To address this, we propose the GUI Action Critic's Data Flywheel System (GAIA), a training framework that enables the models to have iterative critic capabilities, which are used to improve the Test-Time Scaling (TTS) of basic GUI agents' performance. Specifically, we train an Intuitive Critic Model (ICM) using positive and negative action examples from a base agent first. This critic evaluates the immediate correctness of the agent's intended actions, thereby selecting operations with higher success probability. Then, the initial critic guides agent actions to collect refined positive/negative samples, initiating the self-improving cycle.

Is quadratic $O(L^2)$ attention necessary, or is there a sub-quadratic attention mechanism that can achieve comparable performance?

With this attention construction, we can explore how transformer architecture performance varies as a function of the attention scaling behavior controlled by $p$. The overall trend from our experiments shows an S-curve-like behavior where the performance transitions from sliding-window (linear-complexity) attention to full attention over a narrow window of $p$ values, and plateaus as $p$ approaches $1$.

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57df\u4e0b\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u52a0\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9886\u57df\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce Robust Privacy (RP), an inference-time privacy notion inspired by certified robustness: if a model's prediction is provably invariant within a radius-$R$ neighborhood around an input $x$ (e.g., under the $\\ell_2$ norm), then $x$ enjoys $R$-Robust Privacy, i.e., observing the prediction cannot distinguish $x$ from any input within distance $R$ of $x$. We further develop Attribute Privacy Enhancement (APE) to translate input-level invariance into an attribute-level privacy effect. In a controlled recommendation task where the decision depends primarily on a sensitive attribute, we show that RP expands the set of sensitive-attribute values compatible with a positive recommendation, expanding the inference interval accordingly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that RP also mitigates model inversion attacks (MIAs) by masking fine-grained input-output dependence. Even at small noise levels ($\u03c3=0.1$), RP reduces the attack success rate (ASR) from 73% to 4% with partial model performance degradation. RP can also partially mitigate MIAs (e.g., ASR drops to 44%) with no model performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u9690\u79c1\uff08RP\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5c5e\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u589e\u5f3a\uff08APE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u62d3\u5c55\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u503c\u63a8\u65ad\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u654f\u611f\u8f93\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u88ab\u5bf9\u624b\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9690\u79c1\u6982\u5ff5RP\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1APE\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dRP\u62d3\u5c55\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u503c\u63a8\u65ad\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RP\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

To perform thorough, user-tailored product searches, agents should interpret personal preferences, engage in multi-turn dialogues, and ultimately retrieve and discriminate among highly similar products.

In this paper, we introduce ShopSimulator, a large-scale and challenging Chinese shopping environment. Leveraging ShopSimulator, we evaluate LLMs across diverse scenarios, finding that even the best-performing models achieve less than 40% full-success rate. Error analysis reveals that agents struggle with deep search and product selection in long trajectories, fail to balance the use of personalization cues, and to effectively engage with users. Further training exploration provides practical guidance for overcoming these weaknesses, with the combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) yielding significant performance improvements.

This work systematically investigates two questions: how do TSFMs behave under standard sampling-based inference scaling, and can controlled sampling diversity enhance performance? We first examine the properties of TSFMs under standard sampling often fail to adhere to scaling laws due to insufficient exploration of the solution space. Building on this, we then delve into diversified inference scaling via tailored time series perturbations to expand the generative distribution's support. We theoretically analyze the diversity-fidelity trade-off and derive a critical sample threshold for diversified sampling to outperform standard sampling. Extensive experiments across various TSFMs and datasets show proper diversified inference scaling yields substantial performance gains without parameter updates, establishing inference design as a critical, compute-efficient dimension of TSFM optimization. As an application, we propose RobustMSE, a rigorous metric to quantify the headroom performance of TSFM under a fixed budget.

This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels. Within this framework, we identify tool evolution as the critical pathway for capability expansion, which provides verifiable, binary feedback signals.

Code available", "summary": "Early-stage degradation in oscillatory systems often manifests as geometric distortions of the dynamics, such as phase jitter, frequency drift, or loss of coherence, long before changes in signal energy are detectable. In this regime, classical energy-based diagnostics and unconstrained learned representations are structurally insensitive, leading to delayed or unstable detection. We introduce GO-OSC, a geometry-aware representation learning framework for oscillatory time series that enforces a canonical and identifiable latent parameterization, enabling stable comparison and aggregation across short, unlabeled windows. Building on this representation, we define a family of invariant linear geometric probes that target degradation-relevant directions in latent space. We provide theoretical results showing that under early phase-only degradation, energy-based statistics have zero first-order detection power, whereas geometric probes achieve strictly positive sensitivity. Our analysis characterizes when and why linear probing fails under non-identifiable representations and shows how canonicalization restores statistical detectability.

While existing approaches like chain-of-thought prompting operate at the agent level, they fail to provide fine-grained reasoning guidance for individual function parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal \"think\" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility.

Existing literature primarily assumes well-annotated training graphs, while the reliability of labels is not guaranteed in real-world scenarios. Recently, efforts have been made to address the problem of graph learning with label noise. However, existing methods often (i) struggle to distinguish between reliable and unreliable nodes, and (ii) overlook the relational information embedded in the graph topology. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization (DREAM), for reliable, relation-informed optimization on graphs with label noise. Specifically, we design a relation-informed dynamic optimization framework that iteratively reevaluates the reliability of each labeled node in the graph during the optimization process according to the relation of the target node and other nodes. To measure this relation comprehensively, we propose a dual-standard selection strategy that selects a set of anchor nodes based on both node proximity and graph topology. Subsequently, we compute the semantic homogeneity between the target node and the anchor nodes, which serves as guidance for optimization. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to justify the design of DREAM. Extensive experiments are performed on six graph datasets across various domains under three types of graph label noise against competing baselines, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DREAM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDREAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u542b\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53cc\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u9760\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8282\u70b9\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDREAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u951a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u4e49\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e09\u79cd\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eDREAM\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "DREAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u542b\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk.

In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs.

However, the presence of label noise in real scenarios poses a significant challenge in learning robust GNNs, and their effectiveness can be severely impacted when dealing with noisy labels on graphs, often stemming from annotation errors or inconsistencies. To address this, in this paper we propose a novel approach called ICGNN that harnesses the structure information of the graph to effectively alleviate the challenges posed by noisy labels. Specifically, we first design a novel noise indicator that measures the influence contradiction score (ICS) based on the graph diffusion matrix to quantify the credibility of nodes with clean labels, such that nodes with higher ICS values are more likely to be detected as having noisy labels. Then we leverage the Gaussian mixture model to precisely detect whether the label of a node is noisy or not. Additionally, we develop a soft strategy to combine the predictions from neighboring nodes on the graph to correct the detected noisy labels. At last, pseudo-labeling for abundant unlabeled nodes is incorporated to provide auxiliary supervision signals and guide the model optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faICGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u6b65\u9aa4\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u6307\u6807ICS\u91cf\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u7b56\u7565\u4fee\u6b63\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u8282\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ICGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Current guardrail models lack agentic risk awareness and transparency in risk diagnosis. To introduce an agentic guardrail that covers complex and numerous risky behaviors, we first propose a unified three-dimensional taxonomy that orthogonally categorizes agentic risks by their source (where), failure mode (how), and consequence (what). Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AgentDoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in agentic safety moderation in diverse and complex interactive scenarios.

DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth.

Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we design controlled extraction probes to quantify unintended PII memorization and study how factors such as language, PII frequency, task type, and model size influence memorization behavior. We further benchmark four privacy-preserving approaches including differential privacy, machine unlearning, regularization, and preference alignment, evaluating their trade-offs between privacy and task performance.

Current models struggle to accurately decompose intricate visual inputs and connect perception with structured reasoning, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose SpatialMath, a novel Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning Framework designed to integrate spatial representations into structured symbolic reasoning chains. SpatialMath employs a specialized perception module to extract spatially-grounded representations from visual diagrams, capturing critical geometric structures and spatial relationships. These representations are then methodically infused into symbolic reasoning chains, facilitating visual comprehension-aware structured reasoning.

Since most data collected from edge devices are unlabeled, unsupervised Federated Clustering (FC) is becoming increasingly popular for exploring pattern knowledge from complex distributed data. However, due to the lack of label guidance, the common Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) issue of clients have greatly challenged FC by posing the following problems: How to fuse pattern knowledge (i.e., cluster distribution) from Non-IID clients; How are the cluster distributions among clients related; and How does this relationship connect with the global knowledge fusion? In this paper, a more tricky but overlooked phenomenon in Non-IID is revealed, which bottlenecks the clustering performance of the existing FC approaches. That is, different clients could fragment a cluster, and accordingly, a more generalized Non-IID concept, i.e., Non-ICD (Non-Independent Completely Distributed), is derived. To tackle the above FC challenges, a new framework named GOLD (Global Oriented Local Distribution Learning) is proposed. GOLD first finely explores the potential incomplete local cluster distributions of clients, then uploads the distribution summarization to the server for global fusion, and finally performs local cluster enhancement under the guidance of the global distribution. Extensive experiments, including significance tests, ablation studies, scalability evaluations, qualitative results, etc., have been conducted to show the superiority of GOLD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2dNon - IID\u95ee\u9898\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49Non - ICD\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1GOLD\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\uff08FC\uff09\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u7b7e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9762\u4e34Non - IID\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGOLD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u63a2\u7a76\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e0a\u4f20\u5206\u5e03\u6c47\u603b\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u7c7b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eGOLD\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GOLD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709FC\u805a\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure. While this developmental trajectory qualitatively relates to children's, it is quantitatively different: These algorithms indeed require two to four orders of magnitude more data for these neural representations to emerge.

While the truth may be out there in observed trajectories, existing methods struggle to extract it without supervision. In this work, we propose Unsupervised Imitation Learning from Observation (UfO) that addresses all of these limitations. UfO learns a policy through a two-stage process, in which the agent first obtains an approximation of the teacher's true actions in the observed state transitions, and then refines the learned policy further by adjusting agent trajectories to closely align them with the teacher's. Experiments we conducted in five widely used environments show that UfO not only outperforms the teacher and all other ILfO methods but also displays the smallest standard deviation. This reduction in standard deviation indicates better generalisation in unseen scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5UfO\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u72b6\u6001\u53ea\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "UfO\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u518d\u8c03\u6574\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cUfO\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "UfO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5168\u7403\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5371\u673a\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u652f\u6301\u9014\u5f84\u4f46\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4ef7LLM\u6cbb\u7597\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u4f46\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u5efa\u7acb\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u6cbb\u7597\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u53e3\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u5e08\u77ed\u7f3a\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6574\u7406\u4e86500\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f309\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u590d\uff0c\u7531\u4e24\u4f4d\u7cbe\u795e\u79d1\u4e13\u5bb6\u63096\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u8868\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0a\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u9002\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6cbb\u7597\u56de\u590d\u8f83\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5927\u4e14\u60c5\u611f\u5e73\u6de1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b58\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5 - \u60c5\u611f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u4ee5\u5173\u7cfb\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u91cd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u6709\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so.

To formalize this perspective, we model learning as a transport process in the space of probability distributions over model configurations and introduce an epistemic free-energy framework.\n  Within this framework, we define the free-energy drop as a bookkeeping quantity that records the total reduction of epistemic free energy along a learning trajectory. This reduction decomposes into a reversible component associated with potential improvement and an irreversible component corresponding to entropy production.\n  We then derive the Epistemic Speed Limit (ESL), a finite-time inequality that lower-bounds the minimal entropy production required by any learning process to realize a given distributional transformation.

In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdHealth - SCORE\u6846\u67b6\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "motivation": "\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Health - SCORE\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "Health - SCORE\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "Health - SCORE\u8ba9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs.

As such, it is imperative that decoding models are able to generalize across variations, such as recordings from different brain sites, distinct sessions, different types of behavior, and a variety of subjects. Current models can only partially address these challenges and warrant the development of pretrained neural transformer models capable to adapt and generalize. In this work, we propose RPNT - Robust Pretrained Neural Transformer, designed to achieve robust generalization through pretraining, which in turn enables effective finetuning given a downstream task. In particular, RPNT unique components include 1) Multidimensional rotary positional embedding (MRoPE) to aggregate experimental metadata such as site coordinates, session name and behavior types; 2) Context-based attention mechanism via convolution kernels operating on global attention to learn local temporal structures for handling non-stationarity of neural population activity; 3) Robust self-supervised learning (SSL) objective with uniform causal masking strategies and contrastive representations. We pretrained two separate versions of RPNT on distinct datasets a) Multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject microelectrode benchmark; b) Multi-site recordings using high-density Neuropixel 1.0 probes. The datasets include recordings from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and from the primary motor cortex (M1) regions of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed reaching tasks. After pretraining, we evaluated the generalization of RPNT in cross-session, cross-type, cross-subject, and cross-site downstream behavior decoding tasks.

Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x.

Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains.

Leveraging SSH as a proxy for sea ice dynamics enables improved understanding of the feedback mechanisms driving polar climate change and global sea-level rise. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle with reliable treatment effect estimation in spatiotemporal settings due to unobserved confounders and the absence of physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the Knowledge-Guided Causal Model Variational Autoencoder (KGCM-VAE) to quantify causal mechanisms between sea ice thickness and SSH. The proposed framework integrates a velocity modulation scheme in which smoothed velocity signals are dynamically amplified via a sigmoid function governed by SSH transitions to generate physically grounded causal treatments. In addition, the model incorporates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to balance treated and control covariate distributions in the latent space, along with a causal adjacency-constrained decoder to ensure alignment with established physical structures. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world Arctic datasets demonstrate that KGCM-VAE achieves superior PEHE compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Unlike traditional generation tasks where all tokens are uniformly important, CoT emphasizes the final answer, rendering conventional KV compression strategies ineffective. In this paper, we present Crystal-KV, an efficient KV cache management framework tailored for CoT reasoning. Our key insight is the answer-first principle. By mapping answer preferences into think-stage attention map, we distinguish between SlipKV, which mainly maintains the reasoning flow but may occasionally introduce misleading context, and CrystalKV, which truly contributes to the correctness of the final answer. Next, we propose an attention-based Least Recently Frequently Used algorithm. It precisely identifies when a SlipKV entry's utility expires and evicts it, retaining CrystalKV without disrupting reasoning flow.

Yet current approaches struggle between small language models prone to hallucination and limited knowledge retention, and large cloud-based language models plagued by privacy risks and high inference costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChemCRAFT, a novel framework leveraging agentic reinforcement learning to decouple chemical reasoning from knowledge storage. Instead of forcing the model to memorize vast chemical data, our approach empowers the language model to interact with a sandbox for precise information retrieval. This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox. Based on sandbox interactions, we constructed ChemToolDataset, the first large-scale chemical tool trajectory dataset. Simultaneously, we propose SMILES-GRPO to build a dense chemical reward function, promoting the model's ability to call chemical agents. Evaluations across diverse aspects of drug design show that ChemCRAFT outperforms current cloud-based LLMs in molecular structure analysis, molecular optimization, and synthesis pathway prediction, demonstrating that scientific reasoning is not solely an emergent ability of model scale, but a learnable policy of tool orchestration.

These models can act as surrogates for volume data, enabling efficient storage and on-demand reconstruction via model predictions. However, conventional deterministic INRs only provide value predictions without insights into the model's prediction uncertainty or the impact of inherent noisiness in the data. This limitation can lead to unreliable data interpretation and visualization due to prediction inaccuracies in the reconstructed volume. Identifying erroneous results extracted from model-predicted data may be infeasible, as raw data may be unavailable due to its large size. To address this challenge, we introduce REV-INR, Regularized Evidential Implicit Neural Representation, which learns to predict data values accurately along with the associated coordinate-level data uncertainty and model uncertainty using only a single forward pass of the trained REV-INR during inference. By comprehensively comparing and contrasting REV-INR with existing well-established deep uncertainty estimation methods, we show that REV-INR achieves the best volume reconstruction quality with robust data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainty estimates using the fastest inference time. Consequently, we demonstrate that REV-INR facilitates assessment of the reliability and trustworthiness of the extracted isosurfaces and volume visualization results, enabling analyses to be solely driven by model-predicted data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faREV - INR\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfINR\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ed9\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027INRs\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165REV - INR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u503c\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5750\u6807\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "REV - INR\u5728\u6700\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4f53\u79ef\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "REV - INR\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7b49\u503c\u9762\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed training framework for this purpuse. However, the data heterogeneity issue among IoT devices can significantly degrade the model performance and convergence speed in FL. Existing approaches limit in fixed client selection and aggregation on cloud server, making the privacy-preserving extraction of client-specific information during local training challenging. To this end, we propose Client-Centric Adaptation federated learning (FedCCA), an algorithm that optimally utilizes client-specific knowledge to learn a unique model for each client through selective adaptation, aiming to alleviate the influence of data heterogeneity. Specifically, FedCCA employs dynamic client selection and adaptive aggregation based on the additional client-specific encoder. To enhance multi-source knowledge transfer, we adopt an attention-based global aggregation strategy. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse datasets to assess the efficacy of FedCCA.

A Formal Information-Theoretic Analysis on Multi-Turn LLM Games", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": "Presented at the NeusymBridge Workshop at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but still struggle with a critical ability for LLM-based agents: asking good questions for resolving ambiguity in user requests. While prior work has explored information-seeking behavior through word games, existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that provide both final and intermediate signals based on Information Gain (IG). Moreover, they rarely provide systematic comparisons between models that use chain-of-thought reasoning and those that do not. We propose a multi-turn dialogue framework that quantitatively measures how effectively LLMs gather information through yes/no questions in a hierarchical knowledge graph environment. Our framework employs a triad of interacting LLM agents that ask questions, answer them, and update the hypothesis space. We adopt IG as the main metric, grounded in Shannon entropy, to assess query effectiveness at each turn and cumulatively. We instantiate our framework in a geographical Guess My City game setting organized in a five-level taxonomy and evaluate multiple LLM variants under fully and partially observable conditions, with and without Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that, among the evaluated models, the ones with explicit reasoning capabilities achieve higher IG per turn and reach solutions in fewer steps, particularly in partially observable settings. Analysis of reasoning traces reveals that smaller models compensate for limited capacity through more aggressive exploration of candidate questions, while larger models exhibit higher assertiveness in selecting optimal queries, generating candidates with greater potential IG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u662f/\u5426\u95ee\u9898\u6536\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u7406\u731c\u57ce\u5e02\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bcf\u8f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u63a2\u7d22\u5019\u9009\u95ee\u9898\u5f25\u8865\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u67e5\u8be2\u66f4\u679c\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8303\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578bAR - Omni\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7edf\u4e00AR\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1Omni MLLMs\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAR - Omni\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2aTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027 - \u521b\u9020\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "AR - Omni\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u56e0\u5b50\u8fbe\u52300.88\u3002", "conclusion": "AR - Omni\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8303\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

While both areas of law have amassed rich and well-developed areas of scholarly work and doctrinal support, a growing body of scholars are interrogating the intersection between them. This Article argues that the issues surrounding algorithmic accountability demonstrate a deeper, more structural tension within a new generation of disputes regarding law and technology. As I argue, the true promise of AI does not lie in the information we reveal to one another, but rather in the questions it raises about the interaction of technology, property, and civil rights. For this reason, I argue that we are looking in the wrong place if we look only to the state to address issues of algorithmic accountability. Instead, we must turn to other ways to ensure more transparency and accountability that stem from private industry, rather than public regulation. The issue of algorithmic bias represents a crucial new world of civil rights concerns, one that is distinct in nature from the ones that preceded it. Since we are in a world where the activities of private corporations, rather than the state, are raising concerns about privacy, due process, and discrimination, we must focus on the role of private corporations in addressing the issue. Towards this end, I discuss a variety of tools to help eliminate the opacity of AI, including codes of conduct, impact statements, and whistleblower protection, which I argue carries the potential to encourage greater endogeneity in civil rights enforcement. Ultimately, by examining the relationship between private industry and civil rights, we can perhaps develop a new generation of forms of accountability in the process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c11\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u9760\u56fd\u5bb6\u89e3\u51b3\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u8d23\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u79c1\u4f01\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6d88\u9664AI\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0b\u6c11\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0eAI\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u8d23\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u65b0\u4e89\u7aef\u4e2d\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u6ce8\u79c1\u4f01\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u7ed9\u51fa\u6d88\u9664AI\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5982\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u5219\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u58f0\u660e\u548c\u4e3e\u62a5\u4eba\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u65b0\u7684\u6c11\u6743\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u79c1\u4f01\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6b63\u5f53\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u6b67\u89c6\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u79c1\u4f01\u4e0e\u6c11\u6743\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u53d1\u5c55\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u95ee\u8d23\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Neglected or hidden biases within datasets and models can lead to unexpected results. This study addresses the challenges of dataset bias and explores ``shortcut learning'' or ``Clever Hans effect'' in binary classifiers. We propose a novel framework for analyzing the black-box classifiers and for examining the impact of both training and test data on classifier scores. Our framework incorporates intervention and observational perspectives, employing a linear mixed-effects model for post-hoc analysis.

However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u6559\u80b2\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d4Cs\u80fd\u529b\u4ece\u9884\u8bd5\u70b9\u5230\u8bd5\u70b9\u5b9e\u65bd\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u60c5\u5883\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u6f14\u53d8\u53d7\u6559\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e4Cs\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u9636\u6bb5\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u9879\u76ee\u76844Cs\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bd5\u70b9\u6848\u4f8b\uff08IASIS\u3001EASD\u548cUPATRAS\uff09\u76844Cs\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9884\u8bd5\u70b9\u57fa\u7ebf\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9\uff1b\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u60c5\u5883\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u5e38\u505c\u6ede\u6216\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u529b\u6f14\u53d8\u53d7\u6559\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video.

This paper presents an assessment model that permits the use of generative AI for take-home programming assignments while enforcing individual mastery through immediate, assignment-driven written quizzes. To promote authentic learning, these in-class, closed-book assessments are weighted more heavily than the assignments themselves and are specifically designed to verify the student's comprehension of the algorithms, structure, and implementation details of their submitted code. Preliminary empirical data were collected from an upper-level computer science course to examine the relationship between self-reported GenAI usage and performance on AI-free quizzes, exams, and final course grades. Statistical analyses revealed no meaningful linear correlation between GenAI usage levels and assessment outcomes, with Pearson correlation coefficients consistently near zero. These preliminary results suggest that allowing GenAI for programming assignments does not diminish students' mastery of course concepts when learning is verified through targeted, assignment-driven quizzes. Although limited by a small sample size, this study provides preliminary evidence that the risks of cognitive offloading can be mitigated by allowing AI-assisted programming practice while verifying understanding through assignment-driven, AI-free quizzes. The findings support the responsible adoption of open GenAI policies in upper-level CS courses, when paired with rigorous, independent assessment mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5c\u4e1a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6982\u5ff5\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728CS\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5408\u7406\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u653eAI\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u8ba4\u77e5\u5378\u8f7d\u524a\u5f31\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5e26\u56de\u5bb6\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5373\u65f6\u7684\u3001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e66\u9762\u6d4b\u9a8c\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u751f\u638c\u63e1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bfe\u5802\u95ed\u5377\u8bc4\u4f30\u6743\u91cd\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff1b\u6536\u96c6\u9ad8\u5e74\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u7684GenAI\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0e\u65e0AI\u6d4b\u9a8c\u3001\u8003\u8bd5\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6210\u7ee9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aGenAI\u4f7f\u7528\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u3001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528GenAI\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u638c\u63e1\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0AI\u6d4b\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5378\u8f7d\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u9ad8\u5e74\u7ea7CS\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u4e25\u683c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u5408\u7406\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u653eGenAI\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance.

Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit \"understand - plan - code\" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off.

We formalize structural conditions under which adaptive weighting operators are well-defined, admit multiple non-equivalent implementations, and can be hierarchically composed via product-structure normalization. Within this framework, we establish existence and non-uniqueness of conforming operators, characterize convergence of gradient-based optimization under standard assumptions, analyze stability and perturbation robustness, and provide an abstract formulation of safety-constrained distillation.

This property makes tropical methods particularly well suited for shortest paths, scheduling, throughput analysis, and discrete event systems. Despite their theoretical maturity and practical relevance, existing tropical algebra implementations primarily target desktop or server environments and remain largely inaccessible on resource-constrained embedded platforms, where such optimization problems are most acute. We present PALMA (Parallel Algebra Library for Max-plus Applications), a lightweight, dependency-free C library that brings tropical linear algebra to ARM-based embedded systems. PALMA implements a generic semiring abstraction with SIMD-accelerated kernels, enabling a single computational framework to support shortest paths, bottleneck paths, reachability, scheduling, and throughput analysis. The library supports five tropical semirings, dense and sparse (CSR) representations, tropical closure, and spectral analysis via maximum cycle mean computation.

Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations.

Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology.

Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \\textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks.

Code is available at https://github.com/xiaoshideta/Streaming-dLLM", "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens.

To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries.

Drawing on information theory, thermodynamics, and information geometry, we introduce the BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures) framework, modeling learning as the evolution of compressed belief states under dissipation constraints.\n  A central contribution is the Conditional Optimality Theorem, showing that Fisher-Rao regularization measuring change via information divergence rather than Euclidean distance is the unique thermodynamically optimal regularization strategy, achieving minimal dissipation. Euclidean regularization is shown to be structurally suboptimal. The framework unifies existing methods (Ridge, SIGReg, EMA, SAC) as special cases of a single governing equation.\n  Within this view, overfitting corresponds to over-crystallization, while catastrophic forgetting reflects insufficient dissipation control. The framework distinguishes BEDS-crystallizable problems, where beliefs converge to stable equilibria, from BEDS-maintainable problems, which require continual adaptation. It extends naturally to continual and multi-agent systems, where viability, stability under adaptation and finite resources replaces asymptotic optimality as the primary criterion.

Current approaches require either sharing sensitive transaction data or operating in isolation, leaving critical cross-chain laundering patterns undetected. We present FedGraph-VASP, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning framework that enables collaborative anti-money laundering (AML) without exposing raw user data. Our key contribution is a Boundary Embedding Exchange protocol that shares only compressed, non-invertible graph neural network representations of boundary accounts. These exchanges are secured using post-quantum cryptography, specifically the NIST-standardized Kyber-512 key encapsulation mechanism combined with AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption. Experiments on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset with realistic Louvain partitioning show that FedGraph-VASP achieves an F1-score of 0.508, outperforming the state-of-the-art generative baseline FedSage+ (F1 = 0.453) by 12.1 percent on binary fraud detection. We further show robustness under low-connectivity settings where generative imputation degrades performance, while approaching centralized performance (F1 = 0.620) in high-connectivity regimes. We additionally evaluate generalization on an Ethereum fraud detection dataset, where FedGraph-VASP (F1 = 0.635) is less effective under sparse cross-silo connectivity, while FedSage+ excels (F1 = 0.855), outperforming even local training (F1 = 0.785).

However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques.

The focus of this work is twofold: first, to compare the convergence properties of the network outputs under various scaling schemes as the network width and the number of training steps tend to infinity; and second, to provide precise control of the approximation error associated with each scaling regime. Previous work has shown convergence to ordinary differential equations with random initial conditions under inverse square root scaling in the network width. In this work, we shift the focus from convergence speed alone to a more comprehensive statistical characterization of the algorithm's output, with the goal of quantifying uncertainty in neural Actor Critic methods. Specifically, we study a general inverse polynomial scaling in the network width, with an exponent treated as a tunable hyperparameter taking values strictly between one half and one. We derive an asymptotic expansion of the network outputs, interpreted as statistical estimators, in order to clarify their structure. To leading order, we show that the variance decays as a power of the network width, with an exponent equal to one half minus the scaling parameter, implying improved statistical robustness as the scaling parameter approaches one. Numerical experiments support this behavior and further suggest faster convergence for this choice of scaling. Finally, our analysis yields concrete guidelines for selecting algorithmic hyperparameters, including learning rates and exploration rates, as functions of the network width and the scaling parameter, ensuring provably favorable statistical behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u795e\u7ecfActor - Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u540c\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u6027\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6e10\u8fd1\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecfActor - Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u7edc\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u9006\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5c06\u6307\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5c55\u5f00\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u5dee\u968f\u7f51\u7edc\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5e42\u6b21\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u7f29\u653e\u53c2\u6570\u63a5\u8fd11\u65f6\u7edf\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e14\u663e\u793a\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u7387\u7b49\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u53c2\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u826f\u597d\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, in existing designs, tight coupling between \"membership matrix\" and \"subspace matrix U\" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the \"membership matrix\" and \"subspaces U\" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

We address this gap by introducing TensorLens, a novel formulation that captures the entire transformer as a single, input-dependent linear operator expressed through a high-order attention-interaction tensor. This tensor jointly encodes attention, FFNs, activations, normalizations, and residual connections, offering a theoretically coherent and expressive linear representation of the model's computation.

Traditional analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) often requires labor-intensive, manual evaluation of feature geometry, limiting throughput and reproducibility. In this study, we propose SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis. By leveraging deep learning, our approach efficiently extracts morphological features-such as size, shape, and apex curvature-from SEM images, significantly reducing human intervention while improving measurement consistency. A specialized dataset of silicon-based field-emitter tips was developed, and a customized CNN architecture incorporating attention mechanisms was trained for multi-class microstructure classification and dimensional prediction. Comparative analysis with classical image processing techniques demonstrates that SiMiC achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for data-driven microstructure analysis directly linked to field-emission performance, opening avenues for correlating emitter geometry with emission behavior and guiding the design of optimized cold-cathode and SEM electron sources.

However, in realistic federated environments, data is often unpaired and fragmented across disjoint nodes; one node may hold sensor data, while another holds textual logs. These datasets are strictly private and share no common samples. Current federated learning (FL) methods fail in this regime, as they assume local clients possess aligned pairs or require sharing raw feature embeddings, which violates data sovereignty. We propose a novel framework to train a global multimodal transformer across decentralized nodes with disjoint modalities. We introduce a small public anchor set to align disjoint private manifolds. Using Gram matrices calculated from these public anchors, we enforce semantic alignment across modalities through centered kernel alignment without ever transmitting private samples, offering a mathematically superior privacy guarantee compared to prototype sharing. Further, we introduce a subspace-stabilized fine-tuning method to handle FL with huge transformer models. We strictly decouple domain-specific magnitude shifts from semantic direction, ensuring that nodes with varying sensor characteristics align geometrically to the global consensus. Lastly, we propose precision weighted averaging, where efficiently obtained uncertainty estimates are used to downweight uncertain nodes.

The dataset reflects real-world imbalance and temporal irregularities in behavior, and the evaluation adopted a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) strategy to ensure subject-agnostic generalization. The challenge attracted broad participation from 40 teams applying diverse approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning architectures. Submissions were assessed primarily using macro-averaged F1 scores to account for class imbalance.

Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets.

However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected.

Using crime rate prediction with the Bristol City Council data as a case study, we examine how these issues persist. Rather than auditing real-world deployed systems, our goal is to understand why widely adopted bias mitigation techniques often fail when applied to government data. Our findings reveal that bias mitigation approaches applied to government data are not always effective -- not because of flaws in model architecture or metric selection, but due to the inherent properties of the data itself. Through comparing a set of comprehensive models and fairness methods, our experiments consistently show that the mitigation efforts cannot overcome the embedded unfairness in the data -- further reinforcing that the origin of bias lies in the structure and history of government datasets. We then explore the reasons for the mitigation failures in predictive models on government data and highlight the potential sources of unfairness posed by data distribution shifts, the accumulation of historical bias, and delays in data release. We also discover the limitations of the blind spots in fairness analysis and bias mitigation methods when only targeting a single sensitive feature through a set of intersectional fairness experiments.

With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

The Digital Consciousness Model (DCM) is a first attempt to assess the evidence for consciousness in AI systems in a systematic, probabilistic way. It provides a shared framework for comparing different AIs and biological organisms, and for tracking how the evidence changes over time as AI develops. Instead of adopting a single theory of consciousness, it incorporates a range of leading theories and perspectives - acknowledging that experts disagree fundamentally about what consciousness is and what conditions are necessary for it. This report describes the structure and initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model. Overall, we find that the evidence is against 2024 LLMs being conscious, but the evidence against 2024 LLMs being conscious is not decisive.

Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration.

Existing approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf LLMs or simple pipelines, which struggle with long-context understanding and often fail to produce targeted and persuasive responses. In this paper, we propose DRPG, an agentic framework for automatic academic rebuttal generation that operates through four steps: Decompose reviews into atomic concerns, Retrieve relevant evidence from the paper, Plan rebuttal strategies, and Generate responses accordingly. Notably, the Planner in DRPG reaches over 98% accuracy in identifying the most feasible rebuttal direction. Experiments on data from top-tier conferences demonstrate that DRPG significantly outperforms existing rebuttal pipelines and achieves performance beyond the average human level using only an 8B model. Our analysis further demonstrates the effectiveness of the planner design and its value in providing multi-perspective and explainable suggestions. We also showed that DRPG works well in a more complex multi-round setting.

Despite their widespread adoption, it remains unclear how close existing MoE architectures are to optimal with respect to inference cost, as measured by accuracy per floating-point operation and per parameter. In this work, we revisit MoE design from a hardware-software co-design perspective, grounded in empirical and theoretical considerations. We characterize key performance bottlenecks across diverse deployment regimes, spanning offline high-throughput execution and online, latency-critical inference. Guided by these insights, we introduce LatentMoE, a new model architecture resulting from systematic design exploration and optimized for maximal accuracy per unit of compute. Empirical design space exploration at scales of up to 95B parameters and over a 1T-token training horizon, together with supporting theoretical analysis, shows that LatentMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE architectures in terms of accuracy per FLOP and per parameter. Given its strong performance, the LatentMoE architecture has been adopted by the flagship Nemotron-3 Super and Ultra models and scaled to substantially larger regimes, including longer token horizons and larger model sizes, as reported in Nvidia et al.

However, most existing studies focus on instruction-following LLMs, leaving it unclear whether established pruning strategies transfer to reasoning-augmented models that explicitly generate long intermediate reasoning traces. In this work, we conduct a controlled study of pruning for both instruction-following ($\\textbf{LLM-instruct}$) and reasoning-augmented ($\\textbf{LLM-think}$) models. To isolate the effects of pruning, we align pruning calibration and post-pruning recovery data with each model's original training distribution, which we show yields more stable and reliable pruning behavior. We evaluate static depth pruning, static width pruning, and dynamic pruning across 17 tasks spanning classification, generation, and reasoning. Our results reveal clear paradigm-dependent differences: depth pruning outperforms width pruning on classification tasks, while width pruning is more robust for generation and reasoning. Moreover, static pruning better preserves reasoning performance, whereas dynamic pruning excels on classification and generation but remains challenging for long-chain reasoning.

Given the large size of their training data sets, their tendency to memorize training data raises serious privacy and intellectual property concerns. A key threat is the membership inference attack (MIA), which aims to determine whether a given sample was included in the model's training set. Existing MIAs for LLMs rely primarily on output confidence scores or embedding-based features, but these signals are often brittle, leading to limited attack success. We introduce AttenMIA, a new MIA framework that exploits self-attention patterns inside the transformer model to infer membership. Attention controls the information flow within the transformer, exposing different patterns for memorization that can be used to identify members of the dataset. Our method uses information from attention heads across layers and combines them with perturbation-based divergence metrics to train an effective MIA classifier. Using extensive experiments on open-source models including LLaMA-2, Pythia, and Opt models, we show that attention-based features consistently outperform baselines, particularly under the important low-false-positive metric (e.g., achieving up to 0.996 ROC AUC & 87.9% TPR@1%FPR on the WikiMIA-32 benchmark with Llama2-13b). We show that attention signals generalize across datasets and architectures, and provide a layer- and head-level analysis of where membership leakage is most pronounced. We also show that using AttenMIA to replace other membership inference attacks in a data extraction framework results in training data extraction attacks that outperform the state of the art.

While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework. This insight has transformative potential for encouraging both innovation and efficiency in trademark law and practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51faAI\u5728\u5546\u6807\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u5546\u6807\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u65b0\u4f9b\u9700\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9AI\u5728\u5546\u6807\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u9700\u5173\u6ce8AI\u5bf9\u5546\u6807\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5546\u6807\u641c\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86AI\u5728\u5546\u6807\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5546\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u4f9b\u9700\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5546\u6807\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose PC-MCL (Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning) to address these limitations by utilizing three key components: multi-cycle concatenation, a 3-label formulation, and a patient-matching auxiliary task. Our work resolves a multi-label distributional bias in respiratory sound classification, a critical issue inherent to applying multi-cycle concatenation with the conventional 2-label formulation (crackle, wheeze). This bias manifests as a systematic loss of normal signal information when normal and abnormal cycles are combined. Our proposed 3-label formulation (normal, crackle, wheeze) corrects this by preserving information from all constituent cycles in mixed samples. Furthermore, the patient-matching auxiliary task acts as a multi-task regularizer, encouraging the model to learn more robust features and improving generalization.

FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684FP8\u63a8\u7406\u6808\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u53d7\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cFP8\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728veRL\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0FP8\u63a8\u7406\u6808\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u7ea7FP8\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0FP8 W8A8\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u6b65QKV\u7f29\u653e\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u5c06FP8\u6269\u5c55\u5230KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u548cMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534744%\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FP8\u63a8\u7406\u6808\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FP8\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion.

To address this, we propose Virtual Label-distribution-aware Learning (VILL), a simple yet effective framework designed to improve worst-case performance while preserving high overall accuracy.

Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $\u03c0$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdChemNavigator\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a2\u7d22\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7ed3\u6784 - \u6027\u8d28\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u673a\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u53d7\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784 - \u6027\u8d28\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaChemNavigator\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u62df\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7200\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u516d\u6761\u663e\u8457\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u5960\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u5316\u5b66\u76f4\u89c9\u3002"}}

Existing solutions typically rely on expensive multilingual data collection, supervised finetuning, or manual phonetic annotation, which limits the deployment of TTS systems in linguistically diverse settings. We introduce SonoEdit, a model editing technique that surgically corrects pronunciation errors in pre-trained TTS models without retraining. Instead of costly finetuning or explicit phoneme injection, we propose a parsimonious alternative based on Null-Space Pronunciation Editing, which performs a single-shot parameter update to modify the pronunciation of specific words while provably preserving all other model behavior.

However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively.

The problem of phase retrieval has a rich history, with a variety of applications such as optics, crystallography, heteroscedastic regression, astrophysics, etc. A major consideration in algorithms for phase retrieval is robustness against measurement errors. In recent breakthroughs in algorithmic robust statistics, efficient algorithms have been developed for several parameter estimation tasks such as mean estimation, covariance estimation, robust principal component analysis (PCA), etc. in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions. In this paper, we study efficient algorithms for robust phase retrieval with heavy-tailed noise when a constant fraction of both the measurements $y_i$ and the sensing vectors $a_i$ may be arbitrarily adversarially corrupted. For this problem, Buna and Rebeschini (AISTATS 2025) very recently gave an exponential time algorithm with sample complexity $O(n \\log n)$. Their algorithm needs a robust spectral initialization, specifically, a robust estimate of the top eigenvector of a covariance matrix, which they deemed to be beyond known efficient algorithmic techniques (similar spectral initializations are a key ingredient of a large family of phase retrieval algorithms).

While Experience Replay (ER) is a standard countermeasure against catastrophic forgetting, its impact across diverse capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we uncover a critical dichotomy in ER's behavior: while it induces positive backward transfer on robust, unstructured tasks (e.g., boosting performance on previous NLP classification tasks through repeated rehearsal), it causes severe negative transfer on fragile, structured domains like code generation (e.g., a significant relative drop in coding accuracy). This reveals that ER trades structural integrity for broad consolidation. To address this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{Orthogonal Subspace Wake-up (OSW)}. OSW identifies essential parameter subspaces of previous tasks via a brief \"wake-up\" phase and enforces orthogonal updates for new tasks, providing a mathematically grounded \"safety guarantee\" for established knowledge structures. Empirical results across a diverse four-task sequence demonstrate that OSW uniquely succeeds in preserving fragile coding abilities where Replay fails, while simultaneously maintaining high plasticity for novel tasks.

However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8LoD\u8349\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591aLoD\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLoD\u5efa\u6a21\u624b\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\u4e14\u6613\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9LoD\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8LoD\u8349\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u8be6\u7ec6\u5230\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLoD\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cSSIM\u503c\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u53cd\u6620\u53d7\u63a7\u51e0\u4f55\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5efa\u7b51\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the universal approximation capabilities of ReLU networks from a view of polytope decomposition, which offers a more realistic and task-oriented approach compared to current methods. To achieve this, we develop an explicit kernel polynomial method to derive an universal approximation of continuous functions, which is characterized not only by the refined Totik-Ditzian-type modulus of continuity, but also by polytopical domain decomposition. Then, a ReLU network is constructed to approximate the kernel polynomial in each subdomain separately.

When the measurement function is learned from data, the mapping from observations to quantities is determined implicitly by the training distribution and inductive biases, allowing multiple inequivalent mappings to satisfy standard predictive evaluation criteria. We formalize learned measurement functions as a distinct focus of evaluation and introduce measurement stability, a property capturing invariance of the measured quantity across admissible realizations of the learning process and across contexts.

Through a real-world case study, we show that models with comparable predictive performance can implement systematically inequivalent measurement functions, with distribution shift providing a concrete illustration of this failure.

The mainstream paradigm for LLM safety alignment typically adopts a collaborative framework involving three roles: an attacker for adversarial prompt generation, a defender for safety defense, and an evaluator for response assessment. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop reinforcement learning framework called TriPlay-RL that enables iterative and co-improving collaboration among three roles with near-zero manual annotation. Experimental results show that the attacker preserves high output diversity while achieving a 20%-50% improvement in adversarial effectiveness; the defender attains 10%-30% gains in safety performance without degrading general reasoning capability; and the evaluator continuously refines its fine-grained judgment ability through iterations, accurately distinguishing unsafe responses, simple refusals, and useful guidance.

This descriptive cross-sectional study randomly selected 100 questions from HealthSearchQA which contains 3,173 consumer health questions curated by Google Research from publicly available search engine suggestions. Those questions were entered into ChatGPT 5.2 Pro to record and code the cited sources through the lens of the Authority Signals Framework's four domains. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all cited sources (n=615), and cross tabulations were conducted to examine distinction among organization types.

ZC sequences are identified by analyzing the communication protocols of DJI drones, while TFI capture the time-frequency characteristics of drone signals with unknown or non-standard communication protocols. Both modalities are used jointly to enable OODD in the drone remote identification (RID) task. Specifically, ZC sequence features and TFI features are generated from the received radio frequency signals, which are then processed through dedicated feature extraction module to enhance and align them. The resultant multi-modal features undergo multi-modal feature interaction, single-modal feature fusion, and multi-modal feature fusion to produce features that integrate and complement information across modalities. Discrimination scores are computed from the fused features along both spatial and channel dimensions to capture time-frequency characteristic differences dictated by the communication protocols, and these scores will be transformed into adaptive attention weights.

Utilizing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we identify that variables such as Marital Status, Age, and Credit Limit function as potent proxies for gender, allowing models to maintain discriminatory pathways while appearing statistically fair.

Our findings reveal that the protected gender attribute can be reconstructed from purely non-sensitive financial features with an ROC AUC score of 0.65, demonstrating that traditional fairness audits are insufficient for detecting implicit structural bias.

Despite the dominance of deep learning techniques in this field, the internal mechanisms enabling Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve intent detection tasks are poorly understood. In this work, we apply dynamical systems theory to analyze how RNN architectures address this problem, using both the balanced SNIPS and the imbalanced ATIS datasets. By interpreting sentences as trajectories in the hidden state space, we first show that on the balanced SNIPS dataset, the network learns an ideal solution: the state space, constrained to a low-dimensional manifold, is partitioned into distinct clusters corresponding to each intent.

The dense-packed zone height is an important performance and safety indicator but it is often expensive and impractical to measure due to optical limitations. We propose to estimate phase heights using only inexpensive volume flow measurements. To this end, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is first pretrained on synthetic data and physics equations derived from a low-fidelity (approximate) mechanistic model to reduce the need for extensive experimental data. While the mechanistic model is used to generate synthetic training data, only volume balance equations are used in the PINN, since the integration of submodels describing droplet coalescence and sedimentation into the PINN would be computationally prohibitive. The pretrained PINN is then fine-tuned with scarce experimental data to capture the actual dynamics of the separator. We then employ the differentiable PINN as a predictive model in an Extended Kalman Filter inspired state estimation framework, enabling the phase heights to be tracked and updated from flow-rate measurements. We first test the two-stage trained PINN by forward simulation from a known initial state against the mechanistic model and a non-pretrained PINN. We then evaluate phase height estimation performance with the filter, comparing the two-stage trained PINN with a two-stage trained purely data-driven neural network. All model types are trained and evaluated using ensembles to account for model parameter uncertainty. In all evaluations, the two-stage trained PINN yields the most accurate phase-height estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u6d41\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u9ad8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684PINN\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u6c89\u964d\u5668\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u6db2 - \u6db2\u5206\u6563\u76f8\u7684\u5bc6\u76f8\u533a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56e0\u5149\u5b66\u9650\u5236\u800c\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5ec9\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7528\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u7a0b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3PINN\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u5c06\u53ef\u5fae\u7684PINN\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u672a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684PINN\u548c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684PINN\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u9ad8\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684PINN\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5ec9\u4ef7\u4f53\u79ef\u6d41\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u9ad8\u3002"}}

Superlinear attention reformulates standard causal self-attention as a multi-step search problem with $N$ steps, yielding an overall complexity of $O(L^{1+\\frac{1}{N}})$. To illustrate the architecture, we present a baseline $N=2$ implementation, which is algorithmically analogous to standard jump search. In this $O(L^{3/2})$ instantiation, the first step performs $O(L^{3/2})$ span-search to select relevant spans of the sequence, and the second step applies $O(L^{3/2})$ span-attention (standard attention restricted to the selected spans). In an upscaled $O(L^{1.54})$ configuration for robustness, we achieve an average decoding throughput of 114 tokens/sec at 1M context length and 80 tokens/sec at 10M context in our implementation on a modified 30B hybrid MoE model on a single B200 GPU. With limited training, we also obtain strong performance on the NIAH (Needle In A Haystack) task up to 256K context length, demonstrating that the routed span selection is learnable end-to-end.

The absence of a standardized framework for clinically meaningful IQ assessment hinders fair comparison and raises concerns about the reproducibility and reliability of reported advancements in PACT. A benchmarking framework is proposed that provides open-source, anatomically plausible synthetic datasets and evaluation strategies for DL-based acoustic inversion methods in PACT. The datasets each include over 11,000 two-dimensional (2D) stochastic breast objects with clinically relevant lesions and paired measurements at varying modeling complexity. The evaluation strategies incorporate both traditional and task-based IQ measures to assess fidelity and clinical utility. A preliminary benchmarking study is conducted to demonstrate the framework's utility by comparing DL-based and physics-based reconstruction methods. The benchmarking study demonstrated that the proposed framework enabled comprehensive, quantitative comparisons of reconstruction performance and revealed important limitations in certain DL-based methods. Although they performed well according to traditional IQ measures, they often failed to accurately recover lesions. This highlights the inadequacy of traditional metrics and motivates the need for task-based assessments.

This paper presents the first systematic analysis of how LLMs behave when tasked with demographic-conditioned targeted messaging. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences.

While Natural Gradient Descent has been shown to accelerate optimization in the initial phase of training, little attention has been paid to how the training dynamics of second-order optimizers can benefit from GR. In this work, we propose Gradient-Regularized Natural Gradients (GRNG), a family of scalable second-order optimizers that integrate explicit gradient regularization with natural gradient updates. Our framework provides two complementary algorithms: a frequentist variant that avoids explicit inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) via structured approximations, and a Bayesian variant based on a Regularized-Kalman formulation that eliminates the need for FIM inversion entirely. We establish convergence guarantees for GRNG, showing that gradient regularization improves stability and enables convergence to global minima. Empirically, we demonstrate that GRNG consistently enhances both optimization speed and generalization compared to first-order methods (SGD, AdamW) and second-order baselines (K-FAC, Sophia), with strong results on vision and language benchmarks.

We define mentorship-focused evaluation dimensions that go beyond factual accuracy, capturing clarity, alignment, and learning value. Using MentorQA, we compare Single-Agent, Dual-Agent, RAG, and Multi-Agent QA architectures under controlled conditions.

However, their complex internal architectures and lack of transparency make it difficult to explain their decisions, resulting in opaque models that users find hard to understand and trust. In this paper, we explore model-level explanation techniques for deep graph learning models, aiming to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the models' overall decision-making processes and underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we address the problem of counterfactual explanations for deep graph learning models by introducing a generative model-level counterfactual explanation approach called GCFX, which is based on deep graph generation. This approach generates a set of high-quality counterfactual explanations that reflect the model's global predictive behavior by leveraging an enhanced deep graph generation framework and a global summarization algorithm. GCFX features an architecture that combines dual encoders, structure-aware taggers, and Message Passing Neural Network decoders, enabling it to accurately learn the true latent distribution of input data and generate high-quality, closely related counterfactual examples. Subsequently, a global counterfactual summarization algorithm selects the most representative and comprehensive explanations from numerous candidate counterfactuals, providing broad insights into the model's global predictive patterns. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets demonstrate that GCFX outperforms existing methods in terms of counterfactual validity and coverage while maintaining low explanation costs, thereby offering crucial support for enhancing the practicality and trustworthiness of global counterfactual explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5GCFX\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684GCFX\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u603b\u7ed3\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u7b5b\u9009\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGCFX\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u91ca\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "GCFX\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We introduce TrojanGYM, an agentic, LLM-driven framework that automatically curates HT insertions to expose detector blind spots while preserving design correctness. Given high-level HT specifications, a suite of cooperating LLM agents (instantiated with GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3-70B, and Gemini-2.5Pro) proposes and refines RTL modifications that realize diverse triggers and payloads without impacting normal functionality. TrojanGYM implements a feedback-driven benchmark generation loop co-designed with HT detectors, in which constraint-aware syntactic checking and GNN-based HT detectors provide feedback that iteratively refines HT specifications and insertion strategies to better surface detector blind spots. We further propose Robust-GNN4TJ, a new implementation of the GNN4TJ with improved graph extraction, training robustness, and prediction reliability, especially on LLM-generated HT designs. On the most challenging TrojanGYM-generated benchmarks, Robust-GNN4TJ raises HT detection rates from 0% to 60% relative to a prior GNN-based detector. We instantiate TrojanGYM on SRAM, AES-128, and UART designs at RTL level, and show that it systematically produces diverse, functionally correct HTs that reach up to 83.33% evasion rates against modern GNN-based detectors, revealing robustness gaps that are not apparent when these detectors are evaluated solely on existing TrustHub-style benchmarks.

While prior methods have addressed action oscillations via architectural or loss-based methods, the latter typically depend on heuristic or synthetic definitions of state similarity to promote action consistency, which often fail to accurately reflect the underlying system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel loss-based method by introducing a transition-induced similar state. The transition-induced similar state is defined as the distribution of next states transitioned from the previous state. Since it utilizes only environmental feedback and actually collected data, it better captures system dynamics. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Action Smoothing by Aligning Actions with Predictions from Preceding States (ASAP), an action smoothing method that effectively mitigates action oscillations. ASAP enforces action smoothness by aligning the actions with those taken in transition-induced similar states and by penalizing second-order differences to suppress high-frequency oscillations. Experiments in Gymnasium and Isaac-Lab environments demonstrate that ASAP yields smoother control and improved policy performance over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u6e21\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u4f3c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51faASAP\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u5408\u6210\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u6e21\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u4f3c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51faASAP\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6e21\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u4f3c\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e8c\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u632f\u8361\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gymnasium\u548cIsaac - Lab\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cASAP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ASAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Conformal prediction (CP) has emerged as a promising distribution-free framework for generating prediction intervals with rigorous theoretical guarantees. However, applying CP to sequential data presents a primary challenge: the temporal dependencies inherent in time series fundamentally violate the core assumption of data exchangeability, upon which standard CP guarantees are built. This review critically examines the main categories of algorithmic solutions designed to address this conflict. We survey and benchmark methods that relax the exchangeability assumption, those that redefine the data unit to be a collection of independent time series, approaches that explicitly model the dynamics of the prediction residuals, and online learning algorithms that adapt to distribution shifts to maintain long-run coverage.

We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\u03a3_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\u03a3_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{2\u03c0e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\u03a3_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51faWaterSIC\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u4e0eGPTQ\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u56de\u987e\u91cf\u5316\u7387\u548c\u5931\u771f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u52a0\u6743\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6ce8\u6c34\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "WaterSIC\u65b9\u6848\u9ad8\u7387\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5931\u771f\u6781\u9650\uff1bGPTQ\u968f\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u540e\u63a5\u8fd1WaterSIC\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7387\u91cf\u5316\uff0cGPTQ\u968f\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u540e\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0cWaterSIC\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "RSU\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7528V - JEPA\u751f\u6210\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8f66\u8f86\u7aef\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad810%\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u964d\u4f4e\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In parallel, process supervision has long been explored as a way to shape the intermediate reasoning behaviour of LLMs, but existing approaches rely on neural judges to score chain-of-thought steps, leaving them vulnerable to opacity, bias, and reward hacking. To address this gap, we introduce Verifiable Process Reward Models (VPRMs), a reinforcement-learning framework in which intermediate reasoning steps are checked by deterministic, rule-based verifiers. We apply VPRMs to risk-of-bias assessment for medical evidence synthesis, a domain where guideline-defined criteria and rule-based decision paths enable programmatic verification of reasoning traces. Across multiple datasets, we find that VPRMs generate reasoning that adheres closely to domain rules and achieve substantially higher coherence between step-level decisions and final labels. Results show that VPRMs achieve up to 20% higher F1 than state-of-the-art models and 6.5% higher than verifiable outcome rewards, with substantial gains in evidence grounding and logical coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08VPRMs\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u504f\u501a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u795e\u7ecf\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VPRMs\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u504f\u501a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "VPRMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0cF1\u503c\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u9ad820%\uff0c\u6bd4\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u9ad86.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "VPRMs\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

A revised system-oriented version is currently under review", "summary": "Urban bus transit agencies need reliable, network-wide delay predictions to provide accurate arrival information to passengers and support real-time operational control. Accurate predictions help passengers plan their trips, reduce waiting time, and allow operations staff to adjust headways, dispatch extra vehicles, and manage disruptions. Although real-time feeds such as GTFS-Realtime (GTFS-RT) are now widely available, most existing delay prediction systems handle only a few routes, depend on hand-crafted features, and offer little guidance on how to design a scalable, reusable architecture.\n  We present a city-scale prediction pipeline that combines multi-resolution feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning. The framework generates 1,683 spatiotemporal features by exploring 23 aggregation combinations over H3 cells, routes, segments, and temporal patterns, and compresses them into 83 components using Adaptive PCA while preserving 95% of the variance. To avoid the \"giant cluster\" problem that occurs when dense urban areas fall into a single H3 region, we introduce a hybrid H3+topology clustering method that yields 12 balanced route clusters (coefficient of variation 0.608) and enables efficient distributed training.\n  We compare five model architectures on six months of bus operations from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de Montr\u00e9al (STM) network in Montr\u00e9al. A global LSTM with cluster-aware features achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, outperforming transformer models by 18 to 52% while using 275 times fewer parameters. We also report multi-level evaluation at the elementary segment, segment, and trip level with walk-forward validation and latency analysis, showing that the proposed pipeline is suitable for real-time, city-scale deployment and can be reused for other networks with limited adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u6a21\u516c\u4ea4\u5ef6\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u516c\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u516c\u4ea4\u673a\u6784\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5168\u7f51\u5ef6\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8def\u7ebf\u5c11\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408H3+\u62d3\u6251\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u5c40LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6bd4Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f1818 - 52%\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11275\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7ba1\u9053\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7a0d\u4f5c\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

We propose a semi-supervised framework that learns NMR chemical shifts from millions of literature-extracted spectra without explicit atom-level assignments, integrating a small amount of labeled data with large-scale unassigned spectra. We formulate chemical shift prediction from literature spectra as a permutation-invariant set supervision problem, and show that under commonly satisfied conditions on the loss function, optimal bipartite matching reduces to a sorting-based loss, enabling stable large-scale semi-supervised training beyond traditional curated datasets. Our models achieve substantially improved accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art methods and exhibit stronger generalization on significantly larger and more diverse molecular datasets. Moreover, by incorporating solvent information at scale, our approach captures systematic solvent effects across common NMR solvents for the first time.

Although CLIP-based losses effectively align modalities at the semantic level, the resulting latent spaces often remain only partially shared, revealing a structural mismatch known as the modality gap. While the necessity of addressing this phenomenon remains debated, particularly given its limited impact on instance-wise tasks (e.g., retrieval), we prove that its influence is instead strongly pronounced in group-level tasks (e.g., clustering). To support this claim, we introduce a novel method designed to consistently reduce this discrepancy in two-modal settings, with a straightforward extension to the general $n$-modal case.

We demonstrate that this class of defenses is insecure against two practical attack classes: the copy-type attack, in which a human transcribes LLM-generated text producing authentic motor signals, and timing-forgery attacks, in which automated agents sample inter-keystroke intervals from empirical human distributions. Using 13,000 sessions from the SBU corpus and three timing-forgery variants (histogram sampling, statistical impersonation, and generative LSTM), we show all attacks achieve $\\ge$99.8% evasion rates against five classifiers. While detectors achieve AUC=1.000 against fully-automated injection, they classify $\\ge$99.8% of attack samples as human with mean confidence $\\ge$0.993. We formalize a non-identifiability result: when the detector observes only timing, the mutual information between features and content provenance is zero for copy-type attacks. Although composition and transcription produce statistically distinguishable motor patterns (Cohen's d=1.28), both yield $\u03b4$ values 2-4x above detection thresholds, rendering the distinction security-irrelevant.

In this paper, we formalize this challenge by linking input ambiguity to aleatoric uncertainty (AU), which is the irreducible uncertainty arising from underspecified input. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct CV-MedBench, the first benchmark designed for studying input ambiguity in Medical QA. Using this benchmark, we analyze AU from a representation engineering perspective, revealing that AU is linearly encoded in LLM's internal activation patterns. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel AU-guided \"Clarify-Before-Answer\" framework, which incorporates AU-Probe - a lightweight module that detects input ambiguity directly from hidden states. Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods, AU-Probe requires neither LLM fine-tuning nor multiple forward passes, enabling an efficient mechanism to proactively request user clarification and significantly enhance safety. Extensive experiments across four open LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our QA framework, with an average accuracy improvement of 9.48% over baselines. Our framework provides an efficient and robust solution for safe Medical QA, strengthening the reliability of health-related applications.

During training, the ensemble weights are updated iteratively, favoring models exhibiting high performance and low complexity.

Designing effective adaptation strategies is challenging due to the long-term, sequential nature of infrastructure investments, deep uncertainty, and complex cross-sector interactions.

The framework combines long-term climate projections (e.g., IPCC scenario pathways) with models that map projected extreme-weather drivers (e.g. rain) into hazard likelihoods (e.g. flooding), propagate hazards into urban infrastructure impacts (e.g. transport disruption), and value direct and indirect consequences for service performance and societal costs. Embedded in a reinforcement-learning loop, it learns adaptive climate adaptation policies that trade off investment and maintenance expenditures against avoided impacts. In collaboration with Copenhagen Municipality, we demonstrate the approach on pluvial flooding in the inner city for the horizon of 2024 to 2100.

Standard approaches, such as GSEA, rely on predefined phenotypic labels and pairwise comparisons, which limits their applicability in unsupervised settings. Existing unsupervised extensions, including single-sample methods, provide pathway-level summaries but primarily capture linear relationships and do not explicitly model gene-pathway associations. More recently, deep learning models have been explored to capture non-linear transcriptomic structure. However, their interpretation has typically relied on generic explainable AI (XAI) techniques designed for feature-level attribution. As these methods are not designed for pathway-level interpretation in unsupervised transcriptomic analyses, their effectiveness in this setting remains limited.\n  Results: To bridge this gap, we introduce LaCoGSEA (Latent Correlation GSEA), an unsupervised framework that integrates deep representation learning with robust pathway statistics. LaCoGSEA employs an autoencoder to capture non-linear manifolds and proposes a global gene-latent correlation metric as a proxy for differential expression, generating dense gene rankings without prior labels. We demonstrate that LaCoGSEA offers three key advantages: (i) it achieves improved clustering performance in distinguishing cancer subtypes compared to existing unsupervised baselines; (ii) it recovers a broader range of biologically meaningful pathways at higher ranks compared with linear dimensionality reduction and gradient-based XAI methods; and (iii) it maintains high robustness and consistency across varying experimental protocols and dataset sizes.

We present a conditional diffusion framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from noisy body surface signals to heart surface electric potentials. The proposed approach leverages the generative nature of diffusion models to capture the non-unique and underdetermined nature of the ECGI inverse problem, enabling probabilistic sampling of multiple reconstructions rather than a single deterministic estimate. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed framework is geometry-free and purely data-driven, alleviating the need for patient-specific mesh construction. We evaluate the method on a real ECGI dataset and compare it against strong deterministic baselines, including a convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and transformer-based model.

Conventional deep learning approaches typically formulate this problem as deterministic multi-class classification, ignoring both the continuous progression of degeneration and the uncertainty in expert annotations. In this work, we propose ClinNet, a novel trustworthy framework that addresses KOA grading as an evidential ordinal regression problem. The proposed method integrates three key components: (1) a Bilateral Asymmetry Encoder (BAE) that explicitly models medial-lateral structural discrepancies; (2) a Diagnostic Memory Bank that maintains class-wise prototypes to stabilize feature representations; and (3) an Evidential Ordinal Head based on the Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution to jointly estimate continuous KL grades and epistemic uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClinNet achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.892 and Accuracy of 0.768, statistically outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (p < 0.001).

Traditional surrogate-assisted optimization methods using deep learning can accelerate the design process but do not usually incorporate uncertainty quantification, leading to poorer optimization performance due to erroneous predictions in data-sparse regions. Here, we introduce and validate a fundamentally different paradigm of Physics-Informed Uncertainty, where the degree to which a model's prediction violates fundamental physical laws serves as a computationally-cheap and effective proxy for predictive uncertainty. By integrating physics-informed uncertainty into a multi-fidelity uncertainty-aware optimization workflow to design complex frequency-selective surfaces within the 20 - 30 GHz range, we increase the success rate of finding performant solutions from less than 10% to over 50%, while simultaneously reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude compared to the sole use of a high-fidelity solver. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine-learning-driven inverse design for high-dimensional problems, and establish physics-informed uncertainty as a viable alternative to quantifying uncertainty in surrogate models for physical systems, thereby setting the stage for autonomous scientific discovery systems that can efficiently and robustly explore and evaluate candidate designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u8868\u9762\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u8f85\u52a9\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u672a\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba120 - 30 GHz\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u590d\u6742\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u8868\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u627e\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece\u4e0d\u523010%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523050%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Rather than resolving the bulk mixture into discrete cell-type fractions, TwinPurify instead learns continuous, high-dimensional tumor embeddings by leveraging adjacent-normal profiles within the same cohort as \"background\" guidance, enabling the disentanglement of tumor-specific signals without relying on any external reference.\n  Benchmarked against multiple large cancer cohorts across RNA-seq and microarray platforms, TwinPurify outperforms conventional representation learning baselines like auto-encoders in recovering tumor-intrinsic and immune signals. The purified embeddings improve molecular subtype and grade classification, enhance survival model concordance, and uncover biologically meaningful pathway activities compared to raw bulk profiles.

This overlooks a common real-world scenario where data to be forgotten, such as a user's activity records, follows a long-tailed distribution. Our work is the first to investigate this critical research gap. We find that in such long-tailed settings, existing methods suffer from two key issues: \\textit{Heterogeneous Unlearning Deviation} and \\textit{Skewed Unlearning Deviation}. To address these challenges, we propose FaLW, a plug-and-play, instance-wise dynamic loss reweighting method. FaLW innovatively assesses the unlearning state of each sample by comparing its predictive probability to the distribution of unseen data from the same class. Based on this, it uses a forgetting-aware reweighting scheme, modulated by a balancing factor, to adaptively adjust the unlearning intensity for each sample. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaLW achieves superior performance.

The paper has been submitted to IEEE EMBC 2026 and copyright might be transferred without notice", "summary": "We investigate whether temporal embedding models trained on longitudinal electronic health records can learn clinically meaningful representations without compromising predictive performance, and how architectural choices affect embedding quality. Model-guided medicine requires representations that capture disease dynamics while remaining transparent and task agnostic, whereas most clinical prediction models are optimised for a single task. Representation learning facilitates learning embeddings that generalise across downstream tasks, and recurrent architectures are well-suited for modelling temporal structure in observational clinical data. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67). For in-ICU mortality prediction, embedding models consistently outperform end-to-end predictors, improving accuracy from 0.72-0.75 to 0.82-0.83, which indicates that learning embeddings as an intermediate step is more effective than direct end-to-end learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7eb5\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7528MIMIC - IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff0cT - LSTM\u5d4c\u5165\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5728ICU\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u533b\u5b66\u9700\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u75be\u75c5\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6570\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MIMIC - IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7814\u7a76\u6162\u6027\u80be\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4vanilla LSTM\u3001attention - augmented LSTM\u548cT - LSTM\u4e09\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CKD\u9636\u6bb5\u805a\u7c7b\u548cICU\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "T - LSTM\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0cCKD\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001DBI\u503c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5728ICU\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Unlike standard approaches, which rely on a learned encoder and variational lower bounds, QLVMs directly approximate the marginal likelihood by randomized quasi-Monte Carlo integration. While this brute force approach has drawbacks in higher-dimensional spaces, we find that it excels in fitting one, two, and three dimensional deep latent variable models. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that QLVMs consistently outperform conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs) and importance weighted autoencoders (IWAEs) with matched latent dimensionality. The resulting embeddings enable transparent visualization and post hoc analyses such as nonparametric density estimation, clustering, and geodesic path computation, which are nontrivial to validate in higher-dimensional spaces.

While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes.

Although federated learning (FL) is widely regarded as a privacy-aware training paradigm due to its decentralized nature, recent evidence shows that the final global model can still leak sensitive membership information through black-box access. In this paper, we introduce Res-MIA, a novel training-free and black-box membership inference attack that exploits the sensitivity of deep models to high-frequency input details. Res-MIA progressively degrades the input resolution using controlled downsampling and restoration operations, and analyzes the resulting confidence decay in the model's predictions. Our key insight is that training samples exhibit a significantly steeper confidence decline under resolution erosion compared to non-member samples, revealing a robust membership signal. Res-MIA requires no shadow models, no auxiliary data, and only a limited number of forward queries to the target model. We evaluate the proposed attack on a federated ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, where it consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines and achieves an AUC of up to 0.88 with minimal computational overhead. These findings highlight frequency-sensitive overfitting as an important and previously underexplored source of privacy leakage in federated learning, and emphasize the need for privacy-aware model designs that reduce reliance on fine-grained, non-robust input features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRes - MIA\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9891\u7387\u654f\u611f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u662f\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u7ec8\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6cc4\u9732\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRes - MIA\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6062\u590d\u64cd\u4f5c\u964d\u4f4e\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8054\u90a6ResNet - 18\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cAUC\u8fbe0.88\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9891\u7387\u654f\u611f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u662f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u6e90\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

These marketplaces often assert ownership over prompts, claiming them as intellectual property. This paper investigates whether concealed prompts sold on prompt marketplaces can be considered bona fide intellectual property, given that humans and AI tools may be able to infer the prompts based on publicly advertised sample images accompanying each prompt on sale. Specifically, our study aims to assess (i) how accurately humans can infer the original prompt solely by examining an AI-generated image, with the goal of generating images similar to the original image, and (ii) the possibility of improving upon individual human and AI prompt inferences by crafting combined human and AI prompts with the help of a large language model. Although previous research has explored AI-driven prompt inference and protection strategies, our work is the first to incorporate a human subject study and examine collaborative human-AI prompt inference in depth. Our findings indicate that while prompts inferred by humans and prompts inferred through a combined human and AI effort can generate images with a moderate level of similarity, they are not as successful as using the original prompt. Moreover, combining human- and AI-inferred prompts using our suggested merging techniques did not improve performance over purely human-inferred prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u751f\u6210\u827a\u672f\u63d0\u793a\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u539f\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u63d0\u793a\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u9690\u85cf\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u56e0\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5982\u539f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u539f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, continual fine-tuning on sequential tasks induces catastrophic forgetting, where newly acquired knowledge interferes with previously learned capabilities. Despite widespread observations of this phenomenon, the mechanistic understanding remains limited. Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based LLMs during sequential fine-tuning. Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility.

While LVLMs are known to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, existing methods either require access to input channels or depend on knowledge of user queries, assumptions that rarely hold in practical deployments. We propose the first Physical Prompt Injection Attack (PPIA), a black-box, query-agnostic attack that embeds malicious typographic instructions into physical objects perceivable by the LVLM. PPIA requires no access to the model, its inputs, or internal pipeline, and operates solely through visual observation. It combines offline selection of highly recognizable and semantically effective visual prompts with strategic environment-aware placement guided by spatiotemporal attention, ensuring that the injected prompts are both perceivable and influential on model behavior. We evaluate PPIA across 10 state-of-the-art LVLMs in both simulated and real-world settings on tasks including visual question answering, planning, and navigation, PPIA achieves attack success rates up to 98%, with strong robustness under varying physical conditions such as distance, viewpoint, and illumination.

Although existing deep learning-based watermarking systems can hide watermarks in images with minimal impact on image quality, they often lack robustness when encountering image corruptions during transmission, which undermines their practical application value. To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions.

In many scientific and imaging applications, however, clean samples are unavailable, and only noisy or linearly corrupted measurements can be observed. Moreover, latent structures, such as manifold geometries, present in the data are important to extract for further downstream scientific analysis. In this work, we introduce Riemannian AmbientFlow, a framework for simultaneously learning a probabilistic generative model and the underlying, nonlinear data manifold directly from corrupted observations. Building on the variational inference framework of AmbientFlow, our approach incorporates data-driven Riemannian geometry induced by normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of manifold structure through pullback metrics and Riemannian Autoencoders.

Using ReLE, we evaluate 304 models (189 commercial, 115 open-source) across a Domain $\\times$ Capability orthogonal matrix comprising 207,843 samples.

Our analysis reveals that aggregate rankings are highly sensitive to weighting schemes: models exhibit a Rank Stability Amplitude (RSA) of 11.4 in ReLE versus $\\sim$5.0 in traditional benchmarks, confirming that modern models are highly specialized rather than generally superior.

However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts.

Low contrast, motion, foreshortening, overlap, and catheter confounding degrade segmentation and contribute to domain shift across centers. Reliable segmentation, together with vessel-type labeling, enables vessel-specific coronary analytics and downstream measurements that depend on anatomical localization. From 670 cine sequences (407 subjects), we select a best frame near peak opacification using a low-intensity histogram criterion and apply joint super-resolution and enhancement. We benchmark classical Meijering, Frangi, and Sato vesselness filters under per-image oracle tuning, a single global mean setting, and per-image parameter prediction via Support Vector Regression (SVR). Neural baselines include U-Net, FPN, and a Swin Transformer, trained with coronary-only and merged coronary+catheter supervision. A second stage assigns vessel identity (LAD, LCX, RCA). External evaluation uses the public DCA1 cohort. SVR per-image tuning improves Dice over global means for all classical filters (e.g., Frangi: 0.759 vs. 0.741). Among deep models, FPN attains 0.914+/-0.007 Dice (coronary-only), and merged coronary+catheter labels further improve to 0.931+/-0.006.

IoT devices often operate under limited computational resources, lack robust physical safeguards, and are deployed in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, making them prime targets for cyberattacks and malware applications. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to automated malware detection and classification, but practical deployment requires models that are both effective and lightweight. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of four supervised learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) for malware detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. We evaluate model performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, assess sensitivity to training data volume, and analyze temporal robustness to simulate deployment in evolving threat landscapes.

Corresponding author: Maryam Abdolali (maryam.abdolali@kntu.ac.ir)", "summary": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) offers a promising alternative to explicit reward engineering by learning from pairwise trajectory comparisons. However, real-world preference data often comes from heterogeneous annotators with varying reliability; some accurate, some noisy, and some systematically adversarial. Existing PBRL methods either treat all feedback equally or attempt to filter out unreliable sources, but both approaches fail when faced with adversarial annotators who systematically provide incorrect preferences. We introduce TriTrust-PBRL (TTP), a unified framework that jointly learns a shared reward model and expert-specific trust parameters from multi-expert preference feedback. The key insight is that trust parameters naturally evolve during gradient-based optimization to be positive (trust), near zero (ignore), or negative (flip), enabling the model to automatically invert adversarial preferences and recover useful signal rather than merely discarding corrupted feedback. We provide theoretical analysis establishing identifiability guarantees and detailed gradient analysis that explains how expert separation emerges naturally during training without explicit supervision. Empirically, we evaluate TTP on four diverse domains spanning manipulation tasks (MetaWorld) and locomotion (DM Control) under various corruption scenarios. TTP achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining near-oracle performance under adversarial corruption while standard PBRL methods fail catastrophically. Notably, TTP outperforms existing baselines by successfully learning from mixed expert pools containing both reliable and adversarial annotators, all while requiring no expert features beyond identification indices and integrating seamlessly with existing PBRL pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTriTrust - PBRL (TTP) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u4fe1\u4efb\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\uff0c\u73b0\u6709PBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TriTrust - PBRL (TTP) \u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u4efb\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fe1\u4efb\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u635f\u574f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cTTP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6807\u51c6PBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "TTP\u80fd\u4ece\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c60\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709PBRL\u7ba1\u9053\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

We supplement these contextual principles with general principles surfaced from user statements of \\textit{values} regarding AI.

To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness.

On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT).

A central difficulty is that conventional scalar reward formulations, obtained by aggregating these competing objectives, often obscure the structure of their trade-offs. We present a Proximal Policy Optimization based multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that learns a continuous set of policies explicitly representing these trade-offs and evaluates it on a scalable simulation platform for tactical decision making in trucks. The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively. The resulting Pareto frontier is smooth and interpretable, enabling flexibility in choosing driving behavior along different conflicting objectives. This framework allows seamless transitions between different driving policies without retraining, yielding a robust and adaptive decision-making strategy for autonomous trucking applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePPO\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u91cd\u578b\u8f66\u8f86\u9ad8\u901f\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u516c\u5f0f\u96be\u4ee5\u4f53\u73b0\u91cd\u578b\u8f66\u8f86\u9ad8\u901f\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eProximal Policy Optimization\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5361\u8f66\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5178\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96be\u9898\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPrefixRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8131\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u96be\u9898\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5178\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u9898\u4e0a\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8131\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PrefixRL\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u529f\u8131\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8131\u7b56\u7565\u524d\u7f00\u957f\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u83b7\u53d6\u8131\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u63d0\u5347\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "PrefixRL\u5728\u96be\u9898\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb2\u500d\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u9ad83\u500d\uff0c\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u7684\u8131\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "PrefixRL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms a SPY buy-and-hold baseline by 69% in annualized returns and 119% in Sharpe ratio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f13\u89e3\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u60c5\u7eea\u6307\u6807\u548cLLM\u5bf9\u51b2\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddf\u968f\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548cLLM\u4e0b\u884c\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e74\u5316\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4SPY\u4e70\u5165\u6301\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad8\u51fa69%\uff0c\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa119%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u673a\u6784\u57fa\u91d1\u7ecf\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

Accepted at The Web Conference (WWW) 2026", "summary": "Adapter-based Federated Large Language Models (FedLLMs) are widely adopted to reduce the computational, storage, and communication overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning for web-scale applications while preserving user privacy. By freezing the backbone and training only compact low-rank adapters, these methods appear to limit gradient leakage and thwart existing Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs).\n  Contrary to this assumption, we show that low-rank adapters create new, exploitable leakage channels. We propose the Unordered-word-bag-based Text Reconstruction (UTR) attack, a novel GIA tailored to the unique structure of adapter-based FedLLMs. UTR overcomes three core challenges: low-dimensional gradients, frozen backbones, and combinatorially large reconstruction spaces by: (i) inferring token presence from attention patterns in frozen layers, (ii) performing sentence-level inversion within the low-rank subspace of adapter gradients, and (iii) enforcing semantic coherence through constrained greedy decoding guided by language priors. Extensive experiments across diverse models (GPT2-Large, BERT, Qwen2.5-7B) and datasets (CoLA, SST-2, Rotten Tomatoes) demonstrate that UTR achieves near-perfect reconstruction accuracy (ROUGE-1/2 > 99), even with large batch size settings where prior GIAs fail completely. Our results reveal a fundamental tension between parameter efficiency and privacy in FedLLMs, challenging the prevailing belief that lightweight adaptation inherently enhances security.

Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures.

Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce \"Noisomics\", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy.

Existing benchmarks for egocentric domain generalization often conflate covariate shifts with concept shifts, making it difficult to reliably evaluate a model's ability to generalize across input distributions. To address this limitation, we introduce Ego4OOD, a domain generalization benchmark derived from Ego4D that emphasizes measurable covariate diversity while reducing concept shift through semantically coherent, moment-level action categories. Ego4OOD spans eight geographically distinct domains and is accompanied by a clustering-based covariate shift metric that provides a quantitative proxy for domain difficulty. We further leverage a one-vs-all binary training objective that decomposes multi-class action recognition into independent binary classification tasks. This formulation is particularly well-suited for covariate shift by reducing interference between visually similar classes under feature distribution shift. Using this formulation, we show that a lightweight two-layer fully connected network achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art egocentric domain generalization methods on both Argo1M and Ego4OOD, despite using fewer parameters and no additional modalities.

Language models trained on human-generated text inevitably encounter these hierarchical patterns embedded in language, raising the question of whether they might reproduce such dynamics in multi-agent settings. This thesis investigates when and how language models form status hierarchies by adapting Berger et al.'s (1972) expectation states framework. I create multi-agent scenarios where separate language model instances complete sentiment classification tasks, are introduced with varying status characteristics (e.g., credentials, expertise), then have opportunities to revise their initial judgments after observing their partner's responses. The dependent variable is deference, the rate at which models shift their ratings toward their partner's position based on status cues rather than task information. Results show that language models form significant status hierarchies when capability is equal (35 percentage point asymmetry, p < .001), but capability differences dominate status cues, with the most striking effect being that high-status assignments reduce higher-capability models' deference rather than increasing lower-capability models' deference. The implications for AI safety are significant: status-seeking behavior could introduce deceptive strategies, amplify discriminatory biases, and scale across distributed deployments far faster than human hierarchies form organically. This work identifies emergent social behaviors in AI systems and highlights a previously underexplored dimension of the alignment challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u5730\u4f4d\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u5730\u4f4d\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u91cd\u73b0\u8be5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Berger\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u671f\u671b\u72b6\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8ba9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u4f4d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u4f4d\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u987a\u4ece\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u65f6\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u6210\u663e\u8457\u5730\u4f4d\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1b\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9ad8\u5730\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u987a\u4ece\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5730\u4f4d\u5bfb\u6c42\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9AI\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Here we introduce GenAI-Net, a generative AI framework that automates CRN design by coupling an agent that proposes reactions to simulation-based evaluation defined by a user-specified objective. GenAI-Net efficiently produces novel, topologically diverse solutions across multiple design tasks, including dose responses, complex logic gates, classifiers, oscillators, and robust perfect adaptation in deterministic and stochastic settings (including noise reduction).

This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of discrete tokens for SER. Using a fine-tuned WavLM-Large model, we systematically quantify performance degradation across different layer configurations and k-means quantization granularities. To recover the information loss, we propose two key strategies: (1) attention-based multi-layer fusion to recapture complementary information from different layers, and (2) integration of openSMILE features to explicitly reintroduce paralinguistic cues. We also compare mainstream neural codec tokenizers (SpeechTokenizer, DAC, EnCodec) and analyze their behaviors when fused with acoustic features.

Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case.

Submitted to ISIT 2026. This is a follow-up to the following paper: arXiv:2601.10678", "summary": "Due to the fundamental connection between next-symbol prediction and compression, modern predictive models, such as large language models (LLMs), can be combined with entropy coding to achieve compression rates that surpass those of standard compression algorithms. However, this approach relies on the assumption that the predictive model produces identical output distributions at both the encoder and decoder, since even small mismatches can cause the decoding to fail.

In this work, we propose a \\emph{Compress-and-Send Network (CaSNet)} for resource-constrained DMAs, where one microphone serves as the FC and reference. Each of other devices encodes the measured raw data into a feature matrix, which is then compressed by singular value decomposition (SVD) to produce a more compact representation. The received features at the FC are aligned via cross window query with respect to the reference, followed by neural decoding to yield spatially coherent enhanced speech.

FASTQ, the standard format for over two decades, stores one byte per base and one byte per quality score, leading to inefficient I/O, high storage costs, and redundancy. Existing compression tools can mitigate some issues, but often introduce costly decompression or complex dependency issues. Results: We introduce FASTR, a lossless, computation-native successor to FASTQ that encodes each nucleotide together with its base quality score into a single 8-bit value. FASTR reduces file size by at least 2x while remaining fully reversible and directly usable for downstream analyses. Applying general-purpose compression tools on FASTR consistently yields higher compression ratios, 2.47, 3.64, and 4.8x faster compression, and 2.34, 1.96, 1.75x faster decompression than on FASTQ across Illumina, HiFi, and ONT reads. FASTR is machine-learning-ready, allowing reads to be consumed directly as numerical vectors or image-like representations. We provide a highly parallel software ecosystem for FASTQ-FASTR conversion and show that FASTR integrates with existing tools, such as minimap2, with minimal interface changes and no performance overhead. By eliminating decompression costs and reducing data movement, FASTR lays the foundation for scalable genomics analyses and real-time sequencing workflows.

However, figurative language, such as sarcasm, humor, and metaphor, remains a significant challenge, as it conveys intent and emotion through subtle incongruities between expressed and intended meanings. In multimodal settings, accompanying images can amplify or invert textual meaning, demanding models that reason across modalities and account for subjectivity. We propose a three-step framework for developing efficient multimodal reasoning models that can (i) interpret multimodal figurative language, (ii) provide transparent reasoning traces, and (iii) generalize across multiple figurative styles. Experiments across four styles show that (1) incorporating reasoning traces substantially improves multimodal figurative understanding, (2) reasoning learned in one style can transfer to others, especially between related styles like sarcasm and humor, and (3) training jointly across styles yields a generalized reasoning VLM that outperforms much larger open- and closed-source models.

However, it is often challenging to implement interactions for existing static visualizations, since the underlying code and data for existing static visualizations are often not available, and it also takes significant time and effort to enable interactions for them even if the original code and data are available. To fill this gap, we propose Athanor, a novel approach to transform existing static visualizations into interactive ones using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and natural language instructions. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) an action-modification interaction design space that maps visualization interactions into user actions and corresponding adjustments, (2) a multi-agent requirement analyzer that translates natural language instructions into an actionable operational space, and (3) a visualization abstraction transformer that converts static visualizations into flexible and interactive representations regardless of their underlying implementation.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models.

This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u661f\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u5149\u7ea2\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u9002\u7528\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u7ea2\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6d4b\u5149\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684NN\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0cBNN\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u661f\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u5149\u7ea2\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u7ea2\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6d4b\u5149\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u590d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08NN\uff09\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08BNN\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u5206\u88c2\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684NN\u57280.3<z<1.5\u7ea2\u79fb\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6d4b\u5149\u7ea2\u79fb\u504f\u5dee\u4f4e4.5\u500d\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u4f4e1.1\u500d\u3001\u79bb\u7fa4\u7387\u4f4e1.4\u500d\uff1bBNN\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u771f\u503c\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u771f\u503c\u6765\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u591a\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6d4b\u5149\u7ea2\u79fb\uff0c\u5bf9Euclid\u548cLSST\u7b49\u8c03\u67e5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Although current research mostly emphasizes English, the linguistic and cultural biases inherent in Global South languages, like Bengali, are little examined. This research seeks to examine the characteristics and magnitude of gender bias in Bengali, evaluating the efficacy of current approaches in identifying and alleviating bias. We use several methods to extract gender-biased utterances, including lexicon-based mining, computational classification models, translation-based comparison analysis, and GPT-based bias creation. Our research indicates that the straight application of English-centric bias detection frameworks to Bengali is severely constrained by language disparities and socio-cultural factors that impact implicit biases. To tackle these difficulties, we executed two field investigations inside rural and low-income areas, gathering authentic insights on gender bias. The findings demonstrate that gender bias in Bengali presents distinct characteristics relative to English, requiring a more localized and context-sensitive methodology. Additionally, our research emphasizes the need of integrating community-driven research approaches to identify culturally relevant biases often neglected by automated systems. Our research enhances the ongoing discussion around gender bias in AI by illustrating the need to create linguistic tools specifically designed for underrepresented languages.

Large Language Models (LLMs) address this gap by translating natural language (NL) specifications into executable Structured Query Language (SQL) commands for specification-driven SFC management.

However, conflicting objectives across heterogeneous SFT tasks often induce the \"seesaw effect\": optimizing for one task may degrade performance on others, particularly when model parameters are updated indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages.

In this work, we propose a paradigm shift from conventional signal-based decoding by leveraging large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to analyze EEG waveform plots. By converting multivariate EEG signals into stacked waveform images and integrating neuroscience domain expertise into textual prompts, we demonstrate that foundational VLMs can effectively differentiate between different patterns in the human brain.

Experiments on EEG-based seizure detection indicate that state-of-the-art VLMs under RAICL achieved better or comparable performance with traditional time series based approaches.

Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields.\n  In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model.

The principal objective is to assess how artificial intelligence augments implementation of instruments grounded in IHR 2005 and the WHO FCTC while identifying doctrinal and infrastructural bottlenecks. Using comparative doctrinal analysis and legal-normative mapping, the study triangulates legislative instruments, WHO monitoring frameworks, AI systems including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu and EIOS, and compliance metrics. Preliminary results show that AI has improved early detection, surveillance precision and responsiveness in high-capacity jurisdictions, whereas LMICs face infrastructural deficits, data privacy gaps and fragmented legal scaffolding. The findings highlight the relevance of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and GDPR as regulatory prototypes for health-oriented algorithmic governance and contrast them with embryonic AI integration and limited internet penetration in many LMICs. The study argues for embedding AI within a rights-compliant, supranationally coordinated regulatory framework to secure equitable health outcomes and stronger compliance.

Recent works have gravitated towards processing in the spectral domain; however, spectrogram domains typically struggle with phase modeling, which is naturally complex-valued. Most frequency-domain neural codecs either disregard phase information or encode it as two separate real-valued channels, limiting spatial fidelity. This entails the need to introduce adversarial discriminators at the expense of convergence speed and training stability to compensate for the inadequate representation power of the audio signal. In this work we introduce an end-to-end complex-valued RVQ-VAE audio codec that preserves magnitude-phase coupling across the entire analysis-quantization-synthesis pipeline and removes adversarial discriminators and diffusion post-filters. Without GANs or diffusion, we match or surpass much longer-trained baselines in-domain and reach SOTA out-of-domain performance on phase coherence and waveform fidelity.

Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding.\n  In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors.\n  On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.\n  Project website: https://peafowlvla.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPEAfowl\u7528\u4e8e\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u56e0\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4ee4\u724c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u5fae\u52063D\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u90bb\u5c45\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u7528Perceiver\u98ce\u683c\u6587\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8bfb\u51fa\u66ff\u6362\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "\u5728RoboTwin 2.0\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad823.0 pp\uff0c\u5b9e\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u53ef\u9760\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "PEAfowl\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This study addresses lacunae in existing laws where India lacks AI-specific provisions, creating doctrinal inconsistencies and enforcement inefficacies. Global discourse on AI-IPR protections remains nascent. The research identifies gaps in Indian IP laws' adaptability to AI-generated outputs: trade secret protection is inadequate against AI threats; standardized inventorship criteria are absent. Employing doctrinal and comparative methodology, it scrutinizes legislative texts, judicial precedents and policy instruments across India, US, UK and EU. Preliminary findings reveal shortcomings: India's contract law creates fragmented trade secret regime; Section 3(k) of Indian Patents Act blocks AI invention patenting; copyright varies in authorship attribution.

Intriguingly, images differ in their attackability. Specifically, given an attack configuration, some images are easily corrupted, whereas others are more resistant. Evaluating image attackability has important applications in active learning, adversarial training, and attack enhancement. This prompts a growing interest in developing attackability measures. However, existing methods are scarce and suffer from two major limitations: (1) They rely on a model proxy to provide prior knowledge (e.g., gradients or minimal perturbation) to extract model-dependent image features. Unfortunately, in practice, many task-specific models are not readily accessible. (2) Extracted features characterizing image attackability lack visual interpretability, obscuring their direct relationship with the images. To address these, we propose a novel Object Texture Intensity (OTI), a model-free and visually interpretable measure of image attackability, which measures image attackability as the texture intensity of the image's semantic object. Theoretically, we describe the principles of OTI from the perspectives of decision boundaries as well as the mid- and high-frequency characteristics of adversarial perturbations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OTI is effective and computationally efficient. In addition, our OTI provides the adversarial machine learning community with a visual understanding of attackability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u5177\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5ea6\u91cfOTI\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faObject Texture Intensity (OTI)\uff0c\u4ece\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u89d2\u5ea6\u9610\u8ff0\u5176\u539f\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eOTI\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "OTI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Based on its adaptive-width shallow kernel network formulation, we further investigate its function-space characterization, operator evaluation, and computational algorithm. We provide a unified description of the solution space for a broad class of radial basis functions (RBFs). Under mild assumptions, this space admits a characterization as a Besov space, independent of the specific kernel choice. We further demonstrate how the explicit kernel-based structure enables quasi-analytical evaluation of both differential and nonlocal operators, including fractional Laplacians. On the computational end, we study the adaptive-width network and related three-phase training strategy through a comparison with variants concerning the modeling and algorithmic details. In particular, we assess the roles of second-order optimization, inner-weight training, network adaptivity, and anisotropic kernel parameterizations. Numerical experiments on high-order, fractional, and anisotropic PDE benchmarks illustrate the empirical insensitivity to kernel choice, as well as the resulting trade-offs between accuracy, sparsity, and computational cost.

The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline.

By constructing a monosemantic embedding space at the level of an LLM layer and optimizing the framework to explicitly reduce inter-method variability, our approach produces stable input-level importance scores and highlights salient features via a decompressed representation of the layer of interest, advancing the safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in cognitive health and neurodegenerative disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6574\u5408\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u673a\u5236\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u89e3\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6574\u5408\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u673a\u5236\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u5c42\u7684\u89e3\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Traditional augmentation improves robustness, but fails under substantial domain shifts. Recent advances in stylistic augmentation enhance domain generalization by varying image styles but fall short in terms of style diversity or by introducing artifacts into the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts. Additionally, we show that Stylizing ViT is effective beyond training, achieving a 17% performance improvement during inference when used for test-time augmentation.

This diversity reward is combined with outcome correctness and solution efficiency in a z-score-normalized multi-objective objective that stabilizes training.

Most state-of-the-art multi-channel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems extract spatial features only during the speech separation stage, followed by standard single-channel ASR on the separated speech.

Furthermore, most spatial feature extraction methods depend on the knowledge of speaker positions and microphone topology, making the systems reliant on specific settings and challenging to adapt to new equipment. In this work, we propose a solution to these issues with a lightweight embedding module named SpatialEmb, which extracts and encodes spatial information directly for the ASR model, supporting both fixed and arbitrary microphone topology.

Key-value (KV) caching scales linearly with context length, while external retrieval methods often return lexically similar but causally irrelevant passages.\n  We present S3-Attention, a memory-first inference-time framework that treats long-context processing as attention-aligned endogenous retrieval. S3-Attention decodes transient key and query projections into top-k sparse feature identifiers using lightweight sparse autoencoders, and constructs a CPU-based inverted index mapping features to token positions or spans during a single streaming scan.

Integrating topological properties, such as connectivity, improves segmentation accuracy and consistency. However, extracting and embedding such properties - especially from Persistence Diagrams (PD) - is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational cost. Existing approaches mostly encode topology through handcrafted loss functions, which generalize poorly across tasks. In this paper, we propose PIs-Regressor, a simple yet effective module that learns persistence image (PI) - finite, differentiable representations of topological features - directly from data. Together with Topology SegNet, which fuses these features in both downsampling and upsampling stages, our framework integrates topology into the network architecture itself rather than auxiliary losses. Unlike existing methods that depend heavily on handcrafted loss functions, our approach directly incorporates topological information into the network structure, leading to more robust segmentation. Our design is flexible and can be seamlessly combined with other topology-based methods to further enhance segmentation performance. Experimental results show that integrating topological features enhances model robustness, effectively handling challenges like overexposure and blurring in medical imaging. Our approach on three curvilinear benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and topological fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPIs - Regressor\u6a21\u5757\u548cTopology SegNet\uff0c\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u62d3\u6251\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u901a\u7528\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u5206\u5272\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPIs - Regressor\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u6301\u4e45\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Topology SegNet\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u96c6\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u66dd\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u62d3\u6251\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While Age of Information (AoI) quantifies temporal freshness, Version Age of Information (VAoI) captures semantic staleness by accounting for version evolution between transmitters and receivers. Existing VAoI scheduling approaches primarily focus on minimizing average VAoI, overlooking rare but severe staleness events that can compromise reliability under stochastic packet arrivals and unreliable channels. This paper investigates both average-oriented and tail-risk-sensitive VAoI scheduling in a multi-user status update system with long-term transmission cost constraints. We first formulate the average VAoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process and introduce a deep diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm. By generating actions through a diffusion-based denoising process, D2SAC enhances policy expressiveness and establishes a strong baseline for mean performance. Building on this foundation, we put forth RS-D3SAC, a risk-sensitive deep distributional diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. RS-D3SAC integrates a diffusion-based actor with a quantile-based distributional critic, explicitly modeling the full VAoI return distribution. This enables principled tail-risk optimization via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) while satisfying long-term transmission cost constraints. Extensive simulations show that, while D2SAC reduces average VAoI, RS-D3SAC consistently achieves substantial reductions in CVaR without sacrificing mean performance. The dominant gain in tail-risk reduction stems from the distributional critic, with the diffusion-based actor providing complementary refinement to stabilize and enrich policy decisions, highlighting their effectiveness for robust and risk-aware VAoI scheduling in multi-user wireless systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u7528\u6237\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u5c3e\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u7684VAoI\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faD2SAC\u548cRS - D3SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793aD2SAC\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747VAoI\uff0cRS - D3SAC\u964d\u4f4eCVaR\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5747\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VAoI\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u5747VAoI\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9648\u65e7\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5230\u8fbe\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e73\u5747VAoI\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53d7\u9650\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faD2SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51faRS - D3SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660eD2SAC\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747VAoI\uff0cRS - D3SAC\u6301\u7eed\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eCVaR\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5747\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5c3e\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u8d77\u8865\u5145\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684VAoI\u8c03\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, most evaluations rely on AI-human interrater reliability and lack a measurement framework for how cases, learners, and raters jointly shape scores. This leaves robustness uncertain and can expose learners to misguidance from unvalidated systems. We address this by using AI \"simulated learners\" to stress-test and psychometrically characterize assessment pipelines before human use.\n  Objective: Develop an open-source AI virtual patient platform and measurement model for robust competency evaluation across cases and rating conditions.\n  Methods: We built a platform with virtual patients, virtual learners with tunable ACGME-aligned competency profiles, and multiple independent AI raters scoring encounters with structured Key-Features items. Transcripts were analyzed with a Bayesian HRM-SDT model that treats ratings as decisions under uncertainty and separates learner ability, case performance, and rater behavior; parameters were estimated with MCMC.\n  Results: The model recovered simulated learners' competencies, with significant correlations to the generating competencies across all ACGME domains despite a non-deterministic pipeline. It estimated case difficulty by competency and showed stable rater detection (sensitivity) and criteria (severity/leniency thresholds) across AI raters using identical models/prompts but different seeds. We also propose a staged \"safety blueprint\" for deploying AI tools with learners, tied to entrustment-based validation milestones.\n  Conclusions: Combining a purpose-built virtual patient platform with a principled psychometric model enables robust, interpretable, generalizable competency estimates and supports validation of AI-assisted assessment prior to use with human learners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528AI\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u6e90AI\u865a\u62df\u60a3\u8005\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u90e8\u7f72AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u804c\u4e1a\u6559\u80b2\u4e2dAI\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e34\u5e8a\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u865a\u62df\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u865a\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acbAI\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afHRM - SDT\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MCMC\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5404\u9886\u57df\u6709\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6848\u4f8b\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u90e8\u7f72AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u7528\u865a\u62df\u60a3\u8005\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Moreover, an adaptive allocation module is developed to automatically assign the contribution weight of each view, thereby improving the adaptability to diverse datasets.

However, they exhibit critical vulnerabilities when processing malicious URLs: accepting a disguised malicious URL enables subsequent access to unsafe webpages, which can cause severe damage to service providers and users. Despite this risk, no benchmark currently targets this emerging threat. To address this gap, we propose MalURLBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' vulnerabilities to malicious URLs. MalURLBench contains 61,845 attack instances spanning 10 real-world scenarios and 7 categories of real malicious websites. Experiments with 12 popular LLMs reveal that existing models struggle to detect elaborately disguised malicious URLs.

Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u65e0\u75c7\u72b6\u96be\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLDCT\u7ed3\u5408AI\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f46DL\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLungCRCT\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u80ba\u764c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u96be\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u62df\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LungCRCT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "LungCRCT\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dAUC\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a93.91%\u3002", "conclusion": "LungCRCT\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Because privacy judgments are highly contextual, supporting users to engage in privacy-protective actions during chatbot interactions is essential. However, enabling meaningful engagement requires a deeper understanding of how users currently reason about and manage sensitive information during realistic chatbot use scenarios. To investigate this, we qualitatively examined computer science (undergraduate and masters) students' in-the-moment disclosure and protection behaviors, as well as the reasoning underlying these behaviors, across a range of realistic chatbot tasks. Participants used a simulated ChatGPT interface with and without a privacy notice panel that intercepts message submissions, highlights potentially sensitive information, and offers privacy protective actions. The panel supports anonymization through retracting, faking, and generalizing, and surfaces two of ChatGPT's built-in privacy controls to improve their discoverability. Drawing on interaction logs, think-alouds, and survey responses, we analyzed how the panel fostered privacy awareness, encouraged protective actions, and supported context-specific reasoning about what information to protect and how.

We offer an institutional perspective and identify three common fallacies in policy implementations of data disclosures for AI. First, many data transparency proposals exhibit a specification gap between the stated goals of data transparency and the actual disclosures necessary to achieve such goals. Second, reform attempts exhibit an enforcement gap between required disclosures on paper and enforcement to ensure compliance in fact.

This paper presents FARM (Few-shot Adaptive Recognition of Malware), a framework designed to detect and adapt to both covariate and label drift in Windows Portable Executable (PE) malware classification. FARM leverages a triplet autoencoder to project samples into a discriminative latent space, enabling unsupervised drift detection via DBSCAN clustering and dynamic thresholding. For rapid adaptation, it employs few-shot learning using prototype-based classification, requiring only a handful of labeled samples. FARM also supports full retraining when enough drifted samples accumulate, updating the latent space for long-term integration. Experiments on the BenchMFC dataset demonstrate that FARM improves classification performance under covariate drift by 5.6\\%, and achieves an average F1 score of 0.85 on unseen malware families using only few-shot adaptation, which further increases to 0.94 after retraining.

This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faTyphoon S\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u6cf0\u8bed\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u6743\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u4e2d\u6587\u7b49\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u4e3b\u6743\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u4f53\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u91c7\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u6743\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTyphoon S\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21RFT\uff1b\u7528InK - GRPO\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21RFT\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u9002\u914d\u4e3b\u6743\u548c\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u826f\u597d\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cf0\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u6743\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing explainers can only identify the topological information in social networks that significantly influences recommendations, failing to further explain the synergistic effects among this information. Inspired by existing findings that synergistic effects enhance mutual information between inputs and predictions to generate information gain, we extend this discovery to graph data. We quantify graph information gain to identify subgraphs embodying synergistic effects. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose SemExplainer, which explains synergistic effects by identifying subgraphs that embody them. SemExplainer first extracts explanatory subgraphs from multi-view social networks to generate preliminary importance explanations for recommendations. A conditional entropy optimization strategy to maximize information gain is developed, thereby further identifying subgraphs that embody synergistic effects from explanatory subgraphs. Finally, SemExplainer searches for paths from users to recommended items within the synergistic subgraphs to generate explanations for the recommendations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExplainer over baseline methods, providing superior explanations of synergistic effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u606f\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSemExplainer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u627e\u5230\u4f53\u73b0\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u5b50\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u8350\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u591a\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u606f\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u4ea7\u751f\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u8bc6\u522b\u4f53\u73b0\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSemExplainer\uff0c\u5148\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5728\u534f\u540c\u5b50\u56fe\u4e2d\u627e\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemExplainer\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "SemExplainer\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet analyses typically operationalize this set-level inquiry using item-level evidence: pairwise comparisons among exemplars. That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u521b\u610f\u4f5c\u54c1\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u53cc\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u63d2\u503c\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u521b\u610f\u4f5c\u54c1\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u65f6\u5355\u4f4d\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u53cc\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cd5\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u4e24\u4e2a\u521b\u610f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u5426\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u533a\u5206AI\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u827a\u672f\u8f93\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea658%\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u63d2\u503c\u5668\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u4f3c\u4eba\u4f46\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

We introduce FlowBoost, a closed-loop generative framework that learns to discover rare and extremal geometric structures by combining three components: (i) a geometry-aware conditional flow-matching model that learns to sample high-quality configurations, (ii) reward-guided policy optimization with action exploration that directly optimizes the generation process toward the objective while maintaining diversity, and (iii) stochastic local search for both training-data generation and final refinement. Unlike prior open-loop approaches, such as PatternBoost that retrains on filtered discrete samples, or AlphaEvolve which relies on frozen Large Language Models (LLMs) as evolutionary mutation operators, FlowBoost enforces geometric feasibility during sampling, and propagates reward signal directly into the generative model, closing the optimization loop and requiring much smaller training sets and shorter training times, and reducing the required outer-loop iterations by orders of magnitude, while eliminating dependence on LLMs. We demonstrate the framework on four geometric optimization problems: sphere packing in hypercubes, circle packing maximizing sum of radii, the Heilbronn triangle problem, and star discrepancy minimization. In several cases, FlowBoost discovers configurations that match or exceed the best known results. For circle packings, we improve the best known lower bounds, surpassing the LLM-based system AlphaEvolve while using substantially fewer computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFlowBoost\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u6781\u503c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b66\u4e2d\u6781\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u9762\u4e34\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u4e14\u975e\u51f8\u3001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u7528\u3001\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u968f\u673a\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u5efaFlowBoost\u95ed\u73af\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6848\u4f8b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5706\u586b\u5145\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6539\u8fdb\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowBoost\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u6781\u503c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods rely on reactive state-action mappings without explicitly modeling how actions causally transform subsequent visual observations. Lacking such vision-action causality, agents cannot anticipate the visual changes induced by its own actions, leading to unstable behaviors, weak generalization, and cumulative error along trajectory. To address these issues, we introduce \\textsc{NaVIDA} (\\textbf{Nav}igation with \\textbf{I}nverse \\textbf{D}ynamics \\textbf{A}ugmentation), a unified VLN framework that couples policy learning with action-grounded visual dynamics and adaptive execution. \\textsc{NaVIDA} augments training with chunk-based inverse-dynamics supervision to learn causal relationship between visual changes and corresponding actions. To structure this supervision and extend the effective planning range, \\textsc{NaVIDA} employs hierarchical probabilistic action chunking (HPAC), which organizes trajectories into multi-step chunks and provides discriminative, longer-range visual-change cues. To further curb error accumulation and stabilize behavior at inference, an entropy-guided mechanism adaptively sets the execution horizon of action chunks. Extensive experiments show that \\textsc{NaVIDA} achieves superior navigation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters (3B vs. 8B).

Performance was evaluated on NEMA IEC phantom data from three PET systems (GE Discovery MI, Siemens Biograph Vision 600, and Quadra) under varying reconstruction settings and acquisition times. On phantom data, MlPET achieved contrast recovery coefficients consistently higher than standard PET and close to 1.0 (including 10 mm spheres), while reducing background noise and improving spatial definition. Effective pointspread function full width at half maximum decreased from approximately 2 mm in standard PET to below 1 mm with MlPET, a 2.5 fold reduction in blur. Comparable image quality was obtained at 40-80 s acquisition time with MlPET versus 900 s with conventional PET. MlPET provides an efficient approach for quantitative probabilistic post-reconstruction PET analysis.

Although a considerable research effort has been made to automatically detect aim-assist cheats, existing works suffer from unreliable frameworks, limited generalizability, high overhead, low detection performance, and a lack of explainability of detection results. In this paper, we propose XGuardian, a server-side generalized and explainable system for detecting aim-assist cheats to overcome these limitations. It requires only two raw data inputs, pitch and yaw, which are all FPS games' must-haves, to construct novel temporal features and describe aim trajectories, which are essential for distinguishing cheaters and normal players. XGuardian is evaluated with the latest mainstream FPS game CS2, and validates its generalizability with another two different games. It achieves high detection performance and low overhead compared to prior works across different games with real-world and large-scale datasets, demonstrating wide generalizability and high effectiveness. It is able to justify its predictions and thereby shorten the ban cycle.

Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle. OrthoFoundation represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose AI for musculoskeletal imaging. By learning fundamental, joint-agnostic radiological semantics from large-scale multimodal data, it overcomes the limitations of conventional models, which provides a robust framework for reducing annotation burdens and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bOrthoFoundation\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9aa8\u79d1AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa120\u4e07\u5f20\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u819d\u5173\u8282X\u5c04\u7ebf\u548cMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528Dinov3\u9aa8\u5e72\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572814\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbeSOTA\uff0cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u8bca\u65ad\u548cMRI\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u4f24\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u6709\u9ad8\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8de8\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "OrthoFoundation\u662f\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u6210\u50cf\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Modern day VLMs have made tremendous progress in image understanding but they struggle when it comes to understanding technical diagrams. One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans). We introduce several new self-supervision tasks for training and perform extensive experiments with various baseline models and fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B-instruct model on synthetic images on these tasks to obtain LLama-VL-TUG, which significantly improves the ROUGE-L performance of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 2.14x and achieves the best all-round performance across all baseline models. On real-world images, human evaluation reveals that we achieve minimum compilation errors across all baselines in 7 out of 8 diagram types and improve the average F1 score of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 6.97x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u6599\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u83b7LLama - VL - TUG\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u624b\u7ed8\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0d\u4fbf\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3VLM\u7406\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u7ed8\u56fe\u50cf\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u6599\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03Llama 3.2 11B - instruct\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "LLama - VL - TUG\u4f7fLlama 3.2 11B - instruct\u7684ROUGE - L\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53472.14\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c7\u79cd\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u6700\u5c11\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53476.97\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u65b0\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLM\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing post-training quantization methods typically use small, English-only calibration sets; however, their impact on multilingual models remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate eight calibration settings (five single-language and three multilingual mixes) on two quantizers (GPTQ, AWQ) on data from 10 languages. Our findings reveal a consistent trend: non-English and multilingual calibration sets significantly improve perplexity compared to English-only baselines. Specifically, we observe notable average perplexity gains across both quantizers on Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, with multilingual mixes achieving the largest overall reductions of up to 3.52 points in perplexity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that tailoring calibration sets to the evaluation language yields the largest improvements for individual languages, underscoring the importance of linguistic alignment. We also identify specific failure cases where certain language-quantizer combinations degrade performance, which we trace to differences in activation range distributions across languages.

We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting \"Lava is Safe\"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning.

Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies.

CVT groups the use of the voice into so called vocal modes, namely Neutral, Curbing, Overdrive and Edge. Knowledge of the desired vocal mode can be helpful for singing students. Automatic classification of vocal modes can thus be important for technology-assisted singing teaching. Previously, automatic classification of vocal modes has been attempted without major success, potentially due to a lack of data. Therefore, we recorded a novel vocal mode dataset consisting of sustained vowels recorded from four singers, three of which professional singers with more than five years of CVT-experience. The dataset covers the entire vocal range of the subjects, totaling 3,752 unique samples. By using four microphones, thereby offering a natural data augmentation, the dataset consists of more than 13,000 samples combined. An annotation was created using three CVT-experienced annotators, each providing an individual annotation. The merged annotation as well as the three individual annotations come with the published dataset. Additionally, we provide some baseline classification results.

These drawbacks lead to larger data distribution shift, making features less stable for MI-EEG tasks.To address these problems, we introduce STGMFM, a tri-branch framework tailored for dry-electrode MI-EEG, which models complementary spatio-temporal dependencies via dual graph orders, and captures robust envelope dynamics with a multi-scale frequency mixing branch, motivated by the observation that amplitude envelopes are less sensitive to contact variability than instantaneous waveforms. Physiologically meaningful connectivity priors guide learning, and decision-level fusion consolidates a noise-tolerant consensus.

By modeling frame-to-frame variations as unified holistic actions, our method effectively learns inter-frame holistic gesture motion patterns and ensures both spatially and semantically coherent movement trajectories that adhere to realistic motion manifolds. To further bridge the gap in expressive alignment, we propose a Gesture-Audio-Phoneme (GAP) fusion module that can deeply integrate and refine multi-modal signals, ensuring structured and fine-grained alignment between speech semantics, body motion, and facial expressions.

Standard practice aligns all specimens via Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) prior to splitting data into training and test sets, potentially introducing statistical dependence and contaminating downstream predictive models. Here, the effects of GPA-induced contamination are formally characterised using controlled 2D and 3D simulations across varying sample sizes, landmark densities, and allometric patterns. A novel realignment procedure is proposed, whereby test specimens are aligned to the training set prior to model fitting, eliminating cross-sample dependency. Simulations reveal a robust \"diagonal\" in sample-size vs. landmark-space, reflecting the scaling of RMSE under isotropic variation, with slopes analytically derived from the degrees of freedom in Procrustes tangent space.

To address these gaps, we developed Fair-Eye Net, a fair, reliable multimodal AI system closing the clinical loop from glaucoma screening to follow-up and risk alerting.

A fairness constraint reduces missed diagnoses in disadvantaged subgroups. Experimental results show it achieved an AUC of 0.912 (96.7% specificity), cut racial false-negativity disparity by 73.4% (12.31% to 3.28%), maintained stable cross-domain performance, and enabled 3-12 months of early risk alerts (92% sensitivity, 88% specificity).

Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent.

Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm.

Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent.

We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks.

Foot slip is a major source of estimation error: when slip occurs, kinematic measurements violate the no-slip assumption and inject bias during the update step. Our objective is to estimate this slip-induced error and compensate for it. To this end, we augment an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) with a neural compensator that uses an attention mechanism to infer error conditioned on foot-slip severity and then applies this estimate as a post-update compensation to the InEKF state (i.e., after the filter update). The compensator is trained in a latent space, which aims to reduce sensitivity to raw input scales and encourages structured slip-conditioned compensations, while preserving the InEKF recursion.

However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment.

While fluency is often equated with credibility and competence, individuals with atypical speech patterns are routinely marginalized. Given the current state of the debate, this article focuses on the structural biases that shape perceptions of atypical speech and are now being encoded into artificial intelligence. Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems and voice interfaces, trained predominantly on standardized speech, routinely fail to recognize or respond to diverse voices, compounding digital exclusion. As AI technologies increasingly mediate access to opportunity, the study calls for inclusive technological design, anti-bias training to minimize the impact of discriminatory algorithmic decisions, and enforceable policy reform that explicitly recognize speech diversity as a matter of equity, not merely accessibility. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, the article advocates for a cultural and institutional shift in how we value voice, urging co-created solutions that elevate the rights, representation, and realities of atypical speakers in the digital age.

Among other results, we prove that proper PAC learning from positive information is equivalent to the limit operation on Baire space, whereas improper PAC learning from positive information is closely related to Weak K\u0151nig's Lemma and even equivalent to it, when we have some negative information about the admissible hypotheses. If arbitrary hypotheses are allowed, then improper PAC learning from positive information is still in a finitary DNC range, which implies that it is non-deterministically computable, but does not allow for probabilistic algorithms. These results can also be seen as a classification of the degree of constructivity of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning. All the aforementioned results hold if an upper bound of the VC dimension is provided as an additional input information. We also study the question of how these results are affected if the VC dimension is not given, but only promised to be finite or if concept classes are represented by negative or full information. Finally, we also classify the complexity of the VC dimension operation itself, which is a problem that is of independent interest.

Voice cloning in Nepali remains largely unexplored due to its low-resource nature. To address this, we constructed separate datasets: untranscribed audio for training a speaker encoder and paired text-audio data for training a Tacotron2-based synthesizer. The speaker encoder, optimized with Generative End2End loss, generates embeddings that capture the speaker's vocal identity, validated through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimension reduction visualizations. These embeddings are fused with Tacotron2's text embeddings to produce mel-spectrograms, which are then converted into audio using a WaveRNN vocoder. Audio data were collected from various sources, including self-recordings, and underwent thorough preprocessing for quality and alignment. Training was performed using mel and gate loss functions under multiple hyperparameter settings.

The learned harmonic mean estimator has been shown to provide accurate and robust estimates of the marginal likelihood simply using posterior samples. It is agnostic to the sampling strategy, meaning that the samples can be obtained using any method. This enables marginal likelihood calculation and model comparison with whatever sampling is most suitable for the task. However, the internal density estimators considered previously for the learned harmonic mean can struggle with highly multimodal posteriors. In this work we introduce flow matching-based continuous normalizing flows as a powerful architecture for the internal density estimation of the learned harmonic mean.

This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem.

Applying information design methods from Strack and Yang (2024), this paper provides decision problem agnostic conditions under which separation training preference free and applying preferences ex post is optimal. Unlike prior work that requires specifying downstream objectives, the welfare results here apply uniformly across decision problems. The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind, as documented in human AI decision-making, preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through post-processing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8fd0\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65e0\u504f\u597d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e8b\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u504f\u597d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5757\u5316AI\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u6307\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u798f\u5229\u7ed3\u679c\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528Strack\u548cYang\uff082024\uff09\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u9012\u51cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u504f\u597d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u671f\u671b\u6548\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u5f31\u5360\u4f18\uff1b\u5f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5360\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u9009\u6027\uff1b\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\u6469\u64e6\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5d4c\u5165\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

Our results demonstrate that \\textsc{reflect} significantly improves LLM conformance to diverse and complex principles, including principles quite distinct from those emphasized in the model's original parameter fine-tuning, without sacrificing factual reasoning. \\textsc{reflect} is particularly effective at reducing the rate of rare but significant violations of principles, thereby improving safety and robustness in the tail end of the distribution of generations.

To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5957\u4e8c\u5206\u878d\u5408\u7684SeNeDiF - OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728MonuMAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406OOD\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeNeDiF - OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u878d\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c42\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728MonuMAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0d\u540cOOD\u7c7b\u522b\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5957\u4e8c\u5206\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Traditional classification models struggle in this setting, as they assume a closed set of known categories and therefore fail to recognise or meaningfully group previously unseen Ragas. Recent works have tried categorizing unseen Ragas, but they run into a problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the knowledge of previously seen Ragas is diminished. To address this problem, we adopt a unified learning framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled audio, enabling the model to discover coherent categories corresponding to the unseen Ragas, while retaining the knowledge of previously known ones. We test our model on benchmark Raga Identification datasets and demonstrate its performance in categorizing previously seen, unseen, and all Raga classes.

While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.\n  We introduce $\u03b1^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $\u03b1^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $\u03b1^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).\n  We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making.

In this work, we align Large Language Models to embeddings of clinical trials using the recently reported Embedding Language Model (ELM) method. We develop an open-source, domain-agnostic ELM architecture and training framework, design training tasks for clinical trials, and introduce an expert-validated synthetic dataset. We then train a series of ELMs exploring the impact of tasks and training regimes. Our final model, ctELM, can accurately describe and compare unseen clinical trials from embeddings alone and produce plausible clinical trials from novel vectors. We further show that generated trial abstracts are responsive to moving embeddings along concept vectors for age and sex of study subjects. Our public ELM implementation and experimental results will aid the alignment of Large Language Models to embedding spaces in the biomedical domain and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528ELM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u6e90\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51factELM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u6210\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u53cd\u8f6c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ELM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u3001\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684ELM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217ELM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578bctELM\u80fd\u4ec5\u4ece\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ece\u65b0\u5411\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6458\u8981\u5bf9\u6cbf\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u79fb\u52a8\u5d4c\u5165\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5f00\u7684ELM\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}
