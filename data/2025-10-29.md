### [1] [Game-TARS: Pretrained Foundation Models for Scalable Generalist Multimodal Game Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23691)
*Zihao Wang,Xujing Li,Yining Ye,Junjie Fang,Haoming Wang,Longxiang Liu,Shihao Liang,Junting Lu,Zhiyong Wu,Jiazhan Feng,Wanjun Zhong,Zili Li,Yu Wang,Yu Miao,Bo Zhou,Yuanfan Li,Hao Wang,Zhongkai Zhao,Faming Wu,Zhengxuan Jiang,Weihao Tan,Heyuan Yao,Shi Yan,Xiangyang Li,Yitao Liang,Yujia Qin,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍通用游戏智能体Game - TARS，经大规模预训练，在多种游戏任务中表现出色，证明简单可扩展动作表征结合大规模预训练有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能在异构游戏领域进行大规模持续预训练的通用游戏智能体，解决现有API或GUI方法的局限性。

Method: 以人类键盘鼠标输入为统一可扩展动作空间，采用衰减持续损失减少因果混淆，使用高效稀疏思考策略平衡推理深度和推理成本，在超500B令牌上进行预训练。

Result: 在开放世界Minecraft任务成功率是之前SOTA模型约2倍；在未见过的网页3D游戏中接近新手人类通用性；在FPS基准测试中优于GPT - 5等模型；跨游戏和多模态数据扩展时统一动作空间能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 简单可扩展的动作表征与大规模预训练结合，是实现具备广泛计算机使用能力的通用智能体的有前景途径。

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

*Eamon Duede*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨人工智能在科学问题解决中的作用及其对学科创造力的影响，通过数学案例表明计算可拓展学科创造力，但某些人工智能方法会取代它，可能改变科学追求的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人工智能在科学问题解决中的作用以及其对学科创造力的影响。

Method: 借鉴创造力哲学的研究，区分创造性方法和创造性成果，引入学科创造力概念，并通过数学领域的两个案例进行分析。

Result: 计算能拓展学科创造力，某些人工智能方法会取代学科创造力。

Conclusion: 这种取代有改变（甚至降低）科学追求价值的可能性。

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

### [3] [Multi-Environment POMDPs: Discrete Model Uncertainty Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23744)
*Eline M. Bovy,Caleb Probine,Marnix Suilen,Ufuk Topcu,Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对多环境POMDPs，将其推广到对抗信念POMDPs，简化ME - POMDPs，设计算法计算鲁棒策略并在多环境基准测试中验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多环境POMDPs存在离散模型不确定性，需找到对集合内任意POMDP都鲁棒的策略，即最大化最坏情况奖励的策略。

Method: 将ME - POMDPs推广到AB - POMDPs；把任意ME - POMDPs简化为仅在转移和奖励函数或仅在观测和奖励函数上变化的ME - POMDPs；设计精确和近似（基于点）算法计算AB - POMDPs的鲁棒策略。

Result: 能够为扩展到多环境设置的标准POMDP基准计算策略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和算法可有效处理多环境POMDPs问题，计算鲁棒策略。

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

### [4] [Test-Time Tuned Language Models Enable End-to-end De Novo Molecular Structure Generation from MS/MS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23746)
*Laura Mismetti,Marvin Alberts,Andreas Krause,Mara Graziani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出框架利用测试时调优增强预训练transformer模型，实现从串联质谱和分子式端到端从头生成分子结构，在多个基准测试中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前串联质谱识别未知化合物方法依赖数据库匹配或多步骤流程，对参考数据库中不存在的化合物识别困难

Method: 引入框架，利用测试时调优增强预训练transformer模型，实现端到端分子结构生成，绕过手动注释和中间步骤

Result: 在NPLIB1和MassSpecGym基准测试中分别超越DiffMS 100%和20%，在MassSpecGym上测试时调优相对传统微调性能提升62%，预测偏差时生成的分子候选结构仍准确

Conclusion: 该框架能有效解决串联质谱识别未知化合物的难题，为人类解释和可靠识别提供有价值指导

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

### [5] [Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013)
*İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya,İ. Esra Büyüktahtakın,Parshin Shojaee,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究利用大语言模型（LLMs）为调度和组合优化问题发现新启发式算法，聚焦单机器总延迟（SMTT）问题，开发两种新启发式算法并评估性能，显示人类与LLM协作可产生高性能启发式算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为调度和组合优化文献引入新启发式算法，解决单机器总延迟问题。

Method: 开发基于LLM的EDD Challenger（EDDC）和MDD Challenger（MDDC）两种启发式算法，用混合整数规划（MIP）评估，与现有启发式和精确方法对比。

Result: 对于超过100个作业的实例，精确方法计算困难；EDDC在最多500个作业时优于经典EDD规则和其他算法；MDDC始终优于传统启发式，在大而复杂实例中与精确方法竞争。

Conclusion: 人类与LLM协作可针对NP难约束组合优化问题产生可扩展、高性能启发式算法，即使资源有限时也有效。

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

### [7] [Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807)
*Hamid R. Tizhoosh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 非医疗领域基础模型在计算病理学应用有不足，源于概念不匹配，需重新思考范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究基础模型在计算病理学中未达预期突破的原因。

Method: 分析近期系统评估结果，找出基础模型在计算病理学应用中的不足及七项相关成因。

Result: 发现基础模型在计算病理学应用有低诊断准确率等弱点，源于与人体组织内在复杂性的概念不匹配。

Conclusion: 当前病理学基础模型与组织形态本质概念不一致，需重新思考范式。

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ReCAP框架解决大语言模型长时任务推理和规划难题，实验显示能显著提升子目标对齐和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时多步推理和动态重新规划任务对大语言模型是挑战，现有顺序和分层提示方法有缺陷。

Method: 引入ReCAP框架，结合提前规划分解、父计划结构化重新注入、内存高效执行三种机制。

Result: 在多个长时推理基准测试中显著提高子目标对齐和成功率，如同步和异步Robotouille分别提升32%和29%。

Conclusion: ReCAP能将高层目标与低层动作对齐，减少冗余提示，在递归中保持连贯上下文更新。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在分散条件下多智能体在共享环境中的协调难题，具体为多智能体路径规划的分散式目标分配问题。

Method: 智能体基于环境结构化表示生成目标偏好排名，交换排名后用固定确定性冲突解决规则确定分配，在全可观测网格世界环境中系统比较贪心启发式、最优分配和大语言模型智能体。

Result: 大语言模型智能体在设计良好提示和相关定量信息下，能实现接近最优的完成时间，且持续优于传统启发式方法。

Conclusion: 语言模型在多智能体路径规划的分散式目标分配中有潜力，信息结构在这类系统中很重要。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: While Generative AI rapidly advances in various domains, generating truly
creative, aesthetic, and counter-intuitive outputs remains a challenge. This
paper presents an approach to tackle these difficulties in the domain of chess
puzzles. We start by benchmarking Generative AI architectures, and then
introduce an RL framework with novel rewards based on chess engine search
statistics to overcome some of those shortcomings. The rewards are designed to
enhance a puzzle's uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, diversity, and realism.
Our RL approach dramatically increases counter-intuitive puzzle generation by
10x, from 0.22\% (supervised) to 2.5\%, surpassing existing dataset rates
(2.1\%) and the best Lichess-trained model (0.4\%). Our puzzles meet novelty
and diversity benchmarks, retain aesthetic themes, and are rated by human
experts as more creative, enjoyable, and counter-intuitive than composed book
puzzles, even approaching classic compositions. Our final outcome is a curated
booklet of these AI-generated puzzles, which is acknowledged for creativity by
three world-renowned experts.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of digital twins for dynamical system modeling
and control, integrating physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid approaches with
both traditional and AI-driven controllers. Using a miniature greenhouse as a
test platform, four predictive models Linear, Physics-Based Modeling (PBM),
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) are
developed and compared under interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Three
control strategies Model Predictive Control (MPC), Reinforcement Learning (RL),
and Large Language Model (LLM) based control are also implemented to assess
trade-offs in precision, adaptability, and implementation effort. Results show
that in modeling HAM provides the most balanced performance across accuracy,
generalization, and computational efficiency, while LSTM achieves high
precision at greater resource cost. Among controllers, MPC delivers robust and
predictable performance, RL demonstrates strong adaptability, and LLM-based
controllers offer flexible human-AI interaction when coupled with predictive
tools.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

TL;DR: 传统大语言模型对齐方法易受人类偏好异质性影响，提出符号估计器方法，在模拟中表现良好且实现简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型对齐方法在处理人类偏好异质性时存在问题，对成对比较数据拟合朴素概率模型会产生不一致的总体平均效用估计。

Method: 提出符号估计器方法，在聚合步骤用二元分类损失替代交叉熵。

Result: 在使用数字双胞胎的大语言模型对齐模拟中，符号估计器大幅减少偏好扭曲，与标准RLHF相比，角度估计误差减少近35%，与真实总体偏好的分歧从12%降至8%。

Conclusion: 该方法优于明确建模用户异质性的面板数据启发式方法，同时保持现有大语言模型对齐管道的实现简单性。

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测破坏性事件前个体移动模式转变具有挑战性，缺乏个体SIR衡量方法、未充分捕捉移动模式与空间上下文复杂交互、个体移动数据不适合传统预测方法。

Method: 将个体SIR融入条件深度学习模型，利用大规模稀疏个体数据捕捉个体移动模式与本地空间上下文的复杂关系。

Result: 融入个体SIR和空间上下文能增强模型预测事件后个体移动模式的能力，模型可捕捉SIR不同但事件前模式相似个体的移动模式差异。

Conclusion: 将个体SIR和空间上下文融入模型可有效提升对事件后个体移动模式的预测能力。

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

Result: 在八个领域的广泛实验表明OneCast大多优于现有基线。

Conclusion: OneCast框架在跨域时间序列预测中有效，能捕捉季节模式并跟踪特定领域趋势。

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 引入模式语言，提出 DOM 转换模式和超媒体可用性识别模式。

Result: 两种模式为构建和维护准确世界模型提供强大框架。

Conclusion: 该模式语言可实现可扩展、自适应和互操作的跨网络自动化。

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

Method: 对比经典模型（IDM、OVM、OVRV、简化CACC模型）和机器学习模型（随机森林回归器），用真实数据集校准经典模型参数，随机森林模型用间距、速度和间隙类型预测加速度。

Result: 随机森林模型精度更高，不同间隙下RMSE分别为0.0046（中等间隙）、0.0016（长间隙）和0.0025（超长间隙）；基于物理的模型中CACC表现最佳，长间隙RMSE为2.67。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在各场景下表现出色，对模拟电动汽车行为和分析混合自动驾驶交通动态有价值。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Conclusion: OpsAgent是适用于现实世界云系统长期运行的可实际部署且可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Conclusion: 该框架能在保留评估基准难度的同时，有效解决多跳问答数据瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform
complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding
Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP
research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks
training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven
pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training.
MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing
68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far
exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MCTS样本效率问题，改进现有抽象算法在多动作同属抽象节点时随机策略的不足。

Method: 提出并实证评估几种替代的抽象内策略。

Result: 部分替代策略在多数环境和参数设置下优于随机策略。

Conclusion: 提出的替代策略可有效改进MCTS中抽象算法的性能。

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Self - Indicator方法简单、即插即用，计算开销少，能有效提高大语言模型推理准确性。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在传播研究方法工具包中应用不足，需解决相关挑战以推广应用。

Method: 综合新兴研究，提出应对七大挑战的最佳实践指南。

Result: 得到了应对七大挑战的最佳实践指南。

Conclusion: 该指南能让更多传播研究者使用大语言模型进行内容分析，并符合学科质量标准。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型驱动的数据科学系统仅依赖内部推理，缺乏科学理论指导，导致可信度和鲁棒性受限。

Method: 提出基于VDS框架中PCS原则的多智能体系统VDSAgents，实现模块化工作流，各阶段由智能体处理，并结合扰动分析、单元测试和模型验证。

Result: 在九个不同特征的数据集上评估，VDSAgents的结果始终优于AutoKaggle和DataInterpreter。

Conclusion: 将PCS原则嵌入大语言模型驱动的数据科学自动化是可行的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

Motivation: 当前医学人工智能以服务平均患者为目标，在处理边缘患者时表现不佳，导致公平性和信任受损，需要新的设计。

Method: 构建多智能体生态系统，智能体按器官系统、患者群体和分析方式聚类，利用共享模型和证据综合工具，结果在协调层汇聚，进行可靠性、不确定性和数据密度权衡后提供决策支持包。

Result: 未提及明确具体结果。

Conclusion: 从单一模型转向编排智能的方法能使医学AI符合医学的首要原则，实现透明、公平且以个体为中心的医疗。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为AI代理提供表达操作、监管和道德约束的方式，实现可验证合规和分布式保证。

Method: 引入Policy Cards，定义规范层，编码规则等，并可自动验证、版本控制和链接到执行或审计管道。

Result: Policy Cards可使自主代理实现可验证合规，为多代理生态系统的分布式保证奠定基础。

Conclusion: Policy Cards是将高层治理与工程实践结合、实现大规模责任自治的实用机制。

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

Motivation: 大语言模型集成到实时Web应用时，现有推理方法难以兼顾效率和质量，无法满足现代Web平台需求。

Method: 提出Orion框架，将查询推理过程分为关键点生成和内容并行扩展两个阶段，引入管道调度机制实现跨查询并行。

Result: 在不同基准测试中，Orion比基线模型的token生成速度最高提升4.33倍，答案延迟降低3.42倍，推理质量提升18.75%。

Conclusion: Orion框架能有效解决大语言模型在实时Web应用中的推理瓶颈，兼顾推理效率和质量。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

Result: 与现有通用基准相比，APTBench能更有效预测模型作为代理的下游性能，且比全规模端到端代理评估更轻量、成本更低。

Conclusion: APTBench可在预训练阶段评估代理潜力，有效指导模型训练。

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

TL;DR: 本文提出以数据为中心的范式用于医疗领域生成式AI系统的设计与部署，该范式以医疗数据生态系统为基础，可支持高质量医疗服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在医疗领域有巨大潜力，但部署需要深入理解医疗任务，故提出以数据为中心的范式。

Method: 重新定位数据生命周期，以医疗数据生态系统为基础，构建有效数据处理管道，为模型和临床应用提供支持。

Result: 该生态系统能为基础模型提供高质量多模式数据，也可作为知识检索后端支持特定任务推理。

Conclusion: 该生态系统可实现生成式AI在医疗领域的高质量有效部署。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

TL;DR: 现有数据合成方法难以生成高质量多轮函数调用训练数据，提出FunReason - MT框架解决问题，在排行榜评估中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数调用对高级AI系统至关重要，但现有数据合成方法在现实环境中无法生成高质量多轮训练数据，存在结构缺陷。

Method: 提出FunReason - MT框架，通过环境 - API图交互、高级工具查询合成、引导迭代链进行多轮函数调用数据合成。

Result: 基于FunReason - MT生成数据构建的4B模型在BFCLv3排行榜上达到同规模模型的最优性能，在BFCLv4上进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: FunReason - MT为智能体学习提供了可靠且强大的数据源。

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable
complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a
graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset
presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools

constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Result: 联合训练的模型通常表现更好，表明不同领域数据互补，有助于模型学习更好的流场表示。

Conclusion: UniField有潜力成为通用流场表示模型，为神经网络在空气动力学分析中的广泛应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Aerodynamic simulation of the surface pressure field around objects is
crucial for many engineering problems. In recent years, deep neural networks
have emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional, computationally
expensive CFD simulations for modeling surface pressure fields. However, data
scarcity remains a fundamental challenge, limiting the application of neural
networks. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate aerodynamic data
from multiple subfields and conduct joint training to learn more general field
representations. We consolidate five different datasets covering various
fields, including automobiles, trains, aircraft, and general shapes. Facing
significant data differences across different domains, we propose UniField,
which employs a domain-agnostic Transformer module to extract general point
cloud features and customizes domain-specific flow-conditioned adapters to
adapt to the flow information in different subfields. Despite the fact that
aerodynamic data from different subfields are typically governed by different
equations, we compare models trained jointly on all data with those trained
separately on individual datasets and find that the jointly-trained model
commonly demonstrates better performance. This indicates that these data
complement each other to help the model learn better flow field
representations. These results highlight the potential of UniField as a
universal flow field representation model and lay the foundation for broader
applications of neural networks in aerodynamic analysis.

Conclusion: 所提模型可用于研究宏观球形MRE样品的磁致伸缩行为，样品在磁场与材料优选方向一致时沿磁场方向收缩。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a neural network-based, data-driven, decoupled
multiscale scheme for the modeling of structured magnetically soft
magnetorheological elastomers (MREs). On the microscale, sampled
magneto-mechanical loading paths are imposed on a representative volume element
containing spherical particles and an elastomer matrix, and the resulting
boundary value problem is solved using a mixed finite element formulation. The
computed microscale responses are homogenized to construct a database for the
training and testing of a macroscopic physics-augmented neural network model.
The proposed model automatically detects the material's preferred direction
during training and enforces key physical principles, including objectivity,
material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, and the normalization of free
energy, stress, and magnetization. Within the range of the training data, the
model enables accurate predictions of magnetization, mechanical stress, and
total stress. For larger magnetic fields, the model yields plausible results.
Finally, we apply the model to investigate the magnetostrictive behavior of a
macroscopic spherical MRE sample, which exhibits contraction along the magnetic
field direction when aligned with the material's preferred direction.

Conclusion: Odyssey可有效平衡成本和性能，为无服务器数据分析提供更好方案。

Abstract: Running data analytics queries on serverless (FaaS) workers has been shown to
be cost- and performance-efficient for a variety of real-world scenarios,
including intermittent query arrival patterns, sudden load spikes and
management challenges that afflict managed VM clusters. Alas, existing
serverless data analytics works focus primarily on the serverless execution
engine and assume the existence of a "good" query execution plan or rely on
user guidance to construct such a plan. Meanwhile, even simple analytics
queries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast
differences in both performance and cost among plans.
  This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics
pipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine.
Odyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing
state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify
Pareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even
for complex queries. Our evaluations demonstrate that Odyssey accurately
predicts both monetary cost and latency, and consistently outperforms AWS
Athena on cost and/or latency.

Abstract: Joinable Column Discovery is a critical challenge in automating enterprise
data analysis. While existing approaches focus on syntactic overlap and
semantic similarity, there remains limited understanding of which methods
perform best for different data characteristics and how multiple criteria
influence discovery effectiveness. We present a comprehensive experimental
evaluation of joinable column discovery methods across diverse scenarios. Our
study compares syntactic and semantic techniques on seven benchmarks covering
relational databases and data lakes. We analyze six key criteria -- unique
values, intersection size, join size, reverse join size, value semantics, and
metadata semantics -- and examine how combining them through ensemble ranking
affects performance. Our analysis reveals differences in method behavior across
data contexts and highlights the benefits of integrating multiple criteria for
robust join discovery. We provide empirical evidence on when each criterion
matters, compare pre-trained embedding models for semantic joins, and offer
practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods based on dataset
characteristics. Our findings show that metadata and value semantics are
crucial for data lakes, size-based criteria play a stronger role in relational
databases, and ensemble approaches consistently outperform single-criterion
methods.

Motivation: 解决分布式环境资源分配挑战，分析SAP云平台虚拟机的调度和放置以改进工作负载管理。

Method: 通过可观测性工具测量约1800个Hypervisor和48000个VM在30天内的数据，获取资源使用和性能指标。

Result: 发现多种次优调度情况，如CPU资源争用超40%、CPU就绪时间达220秒等。

Conclusion: 推导新的放置和调度算法设计与实现的需求，提供资源分配优化指导，公开数据集供未来研究。

Abstract: Allocating resources in a distributed environment is a fundamental challenge.
In this paper, we analyze the scheduling and placement of virtual machines
(VMs) in the cloud platform of SAP, the world's largest enterprise resource
planning software vendor. Based on data from roughly 1,800 hypervisors and
48,000 VMs within a 30-day observation period, we highlight potential
improvements for workload management. The data was measured through
observability tooling that tracks resource usage and performance metrics across
the entire infrastructure. In contrast to existing datasets, ours uniquely
offers fine-grained time-series telemetry data of fully virtualized
enterprise-level workloads from both long-running and memory-intensive SAP
S/4HANA and diverse, general-purpose applications. Our key findings include
several suboptimal scheduling situations, such as CPU resource contention
exceeding 40%, CPU ready times of up to 220 seconds, significantly imbalanced
compute hosts with a maximum CPU~utilization on intra-building block hosts of
up to 99%, and overprovisioned CPU and memory resources resulting into over 80%
of VMs using less than 70% of the provided resources. Bolstered by these
findings, we derive requirements for the design and implementation of novel
placement and scheduling algorithms and provide guidance to optimize resource
allocations. We make the full dataset used in this study publicly available to
enable data-driven evaluations of scheduling approaches for large-scale cloud
infrastructures in future research.

Abstract: High-speed chemically active flows present significant computational
challenges due to their disparate space and time scales, where stiff chemistry
often dominates simulation time. While modern supercomputing scientific codes
achieve exascale performance by leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs),
existing GPU-based compressible combustion solvers face critical limitations in
memory management, load balancing, and handling the highly localized nature of
chemical reactions. To this end, we present a high-performance compressible
reacting flow solver built on the AMReX framework and optimized for multi-GPU
settings. Our approach addresses three GPU performance bottlenecks: memory
access patterns through column-major storage optimization, computational
workload variability via a bulk-sparse integration strategy for chemical
kinetics, and multi-GPU load distribution for adaptive mesh refinement
applications. The solver adapts existing matrix-based chemical kinetics
formulations to multigrid contexts. Using representative combustion
applications including hydrogen-air detonations and jet in supersonic crossflow
configurations, we demonstrate $2-5\times$ performance improvements over
initial GPU implementations with near-ideal weak scaling across $1-96$ NVIDIA
H100 GPUs. Roofline analysis reveals substantial improvements in arithmetic
intensity for both convection ($\sim 10 \times$) and chemistry ($\sim 4
\times$) routines, confirming efficient utilization of GPU memory bandwidth and
computational resources.

global protocols of interactions by capturing valid patterns of interactions
between participants. Many variations of MPST exist, each one with its rather
specific features and idiosyncrasies. Here we propose a tool (CoMPSeT) that
provides clearer insights over different features in existing MPST. We select a
representative set of MPST examples and provide mechanisms to combine different
features and to animate and compare the semantics of concrete examples. CoMPSeT
is open-source, compiled into JavaScript, and can be directly executed from any
browser, becoming useful both for researchers who want to better understand the
landscape of MPST and for teachers who want to explain global choreographies.

Conclusion: ARIMA_PLUS框架有效克服了时间序列预测和异常检测中的两个挑战，具有高准确性、可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting and anomaly detection are common tasks for
practitioners in industries such as retail, manufacturing, advertising and
energy. Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately
forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically;
and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate
business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these
two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time
series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The
model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of
the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies,
which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made
to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both
forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy,
its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting
repository shows superior performance over not only well-established
statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer
neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms
of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in
Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious
technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically
scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it
possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a
throughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of
interpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series
insights it generates and customizability it offers.

Abstract: A $(\phi,\epsilon)$-expander-decomposition of a graph $G$ (with $n$ vertices
and $m$ edges) is a partition of $V$ into clusters $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ with
conductance $\Phi(G[V_i]) \ge \phi$, such that there are at most $\epsilon m$
inter-cluster edges. Such a decomposition plays a crucial role in many graph
algorithms. [ADK23] gave a randomized $\tilde{O}(m)$ time algorithm for
computing a $(\phi, \phi\log^2 {n})$-expander decomposition.
  In this paper we generalize this result for a broader notion of expansion.
Let $\mu \in {\mathbb{R}}_{\ge 0 }^n$ be a vertex measure. A standard
generalization of conductance of a cut $(S,\bar{S})$ is its $\mu$-expansion
$\Phi^{\mu}_G(S,\bar{S}) = |E(S,\bar{S})|/\min \mu(S)),\mu(\bar{S})\}$, where
$\mu(S) = \sum_{v\in S} \mu(v)$. We present a randomized $\tilde{O}(m)$ time
algorithm for computing a $(\phi, \phi \log^2
{n}\left(\frac{\mu(V)}{m}\right))$-expander decomposition with respect to
$\mu$-expansion.

Conclusion: 解决了分布式存储与访问的在线成本优化问题，新算法有较好的竞争比表现。

Abstract: This paper studies an online cost optimization problem for distributed
storage and access. The goal is to dynamically create and delete copies of data
objects over time at geo-distributed servers to serve access requests and
minimize the total storage and network cost. We revisit a recent algorithm in
the literature and show that it does not have a competitive ratio of $2$ as
claimed by constructing a counterexample. We further prove that no
deterministic online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio bounded by $2$
for the general cost optimization problem. We develop an online algorithm and
prove that it achieves a competitive ratio of $\max\{2, \min\{\gamma, 3\}\}$,
where $\gamma$ is the max/min storage cost ratio among all servers. Examples
are given to confirm the tightness of competitive analysis. We also empirically
evaluate algorithms using real object access traces.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the robust geometric median problem in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, with a focus on coreset construction.A coreset is a compact
summary of a dataset $P$ of size $n$ that approximates the robust cost for all
centers $c$ within a multiplicative error $\varepsilon$. Given an outlier count
$m$, we construct a coreset of size $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} \cdot
\min\{\varepsilon^{-2}, d\})$ when $n \geq 4m$, eliminating the $O(m)$
dependency present in prior work [Huang et al., 2022 & 2023]. For the special
case of $d = 1$, we achieve an optimal coreset size of
$\tilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-1/2} + \frac{m}{n} \varepsilon^{-1})$, revealing
a clear separation from the vanilla case studied in [Huang et al., 2023;
Afshani and Chris, 2024]. Our results further extend to robust
$(k,z)$-clustering in various metric spaces, eliminating the $m$-dependence
under mild data assumptions. The key technical contribution is a novel
non-component-wise error analysis, enabling substantial reduction of outlier
influence, unlike prior methods that retain them.Empirically, our algorithms
consistently outperform existing baselines in terms of size-accuracy tradeoffs
and runtime, even when data assumptions are violated across a wide range of
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将非结构化法律合同转化为标准化、机器可读格式对金融工作流自动化至关重要，但复杂法律文件转换为CDM表示有挑战。

Method: 提出扩展的CDMizer框架，应用于实际任务并与ISDA的基准进行比较。

Result: CDMizer结合小的开源大语言模型在准确性和效率上与大的专有模型有竞争力。

Conclusion: 资源高效的解决方案有自动化法律合同转换的潜力，可满足资源受限或有严格数据隐私要求的金融机构需求。

Abstract: The transformation of unstructured legal contracts into standardized,
machine-readable formats is essential for automating financial workflows. The
Common Domain Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for this purpose,
but converting complex legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into
CDM representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
an extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven solution that ensures
syntactic correctness and adherence to the CDM schema during contract-to-CDM
conversion. We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing
its performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that
CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large
Language Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and
efficiency against larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the
potential of resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract
transformation, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet
the needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or strict data
privacy requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模推荐系统预排序阶段存在模型表达能力和计算效率的权衡，双塔架构能力有限且会放大样本选择偏差问题。

Method: 提出DUET框架，进行集合级预测，采用双模型协同训练机制通过相互伪标签细化扩展对未曝光物品的监督。

Result: 通过大量离线实验和在线A/B测试，DUET始终优于现有基线模型，多个核心业务指标有提升。

Conclusion: DUET能在计算预算紧张情况下实现表达性建模，缓解样本选择偏差，可有效应用于实际推荐系统。

Abstract: The pre-ranking stage plays a pivotal role in large-scale recommender systems
but faces an intrinsic trade-off between model expressiveness and computational
efficiency. Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,
industry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are
computationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,
they struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships
among candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent
and diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies
the Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on
biased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with
distinct distributions.
  To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DUET} (\textbf{DU}al Model
Co-Training for \textbf{E}ntire Space C\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise
pre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight
computational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs
set-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,
enabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the
computational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism
extends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,
effectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and
online A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
and achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present,
DUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the
main traffic for hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles on long, structured financial
filings where relevant evidence is sparse and cross-referenced. This paper
presents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a
novel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata. We
introduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich
document chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements, including
pre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings,
benchmarked on the FinanceBench dataset. Our results reveal that while a
powerful reranker is essential for precision, the most significant performance
gains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text ("contextual
chunks"). Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval
optimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance.
Additionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling,
cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical
trade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency. This study
provides a blueprint for building robust, metadata-aware RAG systems for
financial document analysis.

Motivation: 多数推荐系统忽略时间戳的现实世界上下文，如节假日、事件和季节模式。

Method: 使用大语言模型从时间戳和粗略位置生成地理时间嵌入，引入信息性测试，通过直接特征融合或辅助损失将嵌入融入顺序模型。

Result: 在MovieLens、LastFM和生产数据集上证明嵌入能提供与完整模型集成结果一致的预测信号。

Conclusion: 需要自适应或混合推荐策略，并发布上下文丰富的MovieLens数据集。

Abstract: Most recommender systems treat timestamps as numeric or cyclical values,
overlooking real-world context such as holidays, events, and seasonal patterns.
We propose a scalable framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate geo-temporal embeddings from only a timestamp and coarse location,
capturing holidays, seasonal trends, and local/global events. We then introduce
a geo-temporal embedding informativeness test as a lightweight diagnostic,
demonstrating on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset that these
embeddings provide predictive signal consistent with the outcomes of full model
integrations. Geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential models
through (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings or (2) an auxiliary
loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. Our findings highlight
the need for adaptive or hybrid recommendation strategies, and we release a
context-enriched MovieLens dataset to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究生成式推荐系统能否有类似大语言模型的扩展优势，解决公共基准上的扩展定律及最小后训练配方问题。

Method: 构建MiniOneRec框架，用Residual Quantized VAE生成SIDs，在Amazon Review数据集上对Qwen骨干模型后训练，提出后训练管道。

Result: 实验显示训练和评估损失随模型大小增加呈下降趋势，后训练技术提升了排名准确性和候选多样性。

Conclusion: 生成式推荐方法具有参数效率，提出的后训练管道有效。

Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has renewed interest in
whether recommender systems can achieve similar scaling benefits. Conventional
recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as
embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm
replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by
autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain
proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected
scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training
recipe that enables competitive performance?
  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully
open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end
workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and
recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual
Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward
trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,
validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further
enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training
pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies
reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together,
these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and
candidate diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析比单模态方法能更丰富准确理解人类情感，需开发有效模型。

Method: 提出BERT - ViT - EF模型，通过早期融合策略结合BERT和ViT；提出扩展DTCN，在BERT后增加Transformer层并采用对比学习。

Result: DTCN在TumEmo上准确率78.4%、F1分数78.3%，在MVSA - Single上准确率76.6%、F1分数75.9%。

Conclusion: 早期融合和深度上下文建模在基于Transformer的多模态情感分析中有优势。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

TL;DR: 本文研究降低MACE计算成本同时保持精度的方法，发现融合等变核和混合精度推理可显著加速力场计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究降低SO(3)等变模型MACE计算成本且不损害物理保真度的方法。

Method: 对MACE进行端到端和逐块分析，比较e3nn和NVIDIA cuEquivariance后端，评估不同精度设置。

Result: cuEquivariance使推理延迟降低约3倍；FP32模型中仅将线性层转换为BF16/FP16可额外加速约4倍；训练时半精度权重会降低力的RMSE；混合模块会导致表示不匹配。

Conclusion: 融合等变核和混合精度推理可大幅加速力场计算，建议默认使用cuEquivariance和FP32，线性层用BF16/FP16以实现最大吞吐量，训练用FP32。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

Method: 在皮肤病数据集上进行实证实验，通过详细威胁建模、实验基准测试和模型评估。

Result: 防御措施能降低攻击成功率，但需与模型在干净数据上的性能平衡。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用综合技术、伦理和政策的方法构建更具弹性和公平性的医疗AI。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在拓扑优化中存在局限，受固定网格、少量边界条件和事后优化限制，无法广泛应用。

Method: 引入OAT框架，结合分辨率和形状无关的自动编码器、隐式神经场解码器和条件潜扩散模型，在新的OpenTO数据集上训练。

Result: 在四个公共基准和两个具有挑战性的未见过测试中，OAT比最佳先前模型平均柔度降低达90%，在单GPU上推理时间不到1秒。

Conclusion: OAT是一个通用、快速且与分辨率无关的物理感知拓扑优化框架，提供的数据集可促进逆向设计生成建模研究。

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

Motivation: 随机森林在表格预测任务中推理延迟和内存需求高，限制在对延迟敏感或资源受限环境的部署，因此需新方法。

Method: 引入DiNo（通过观察对最近共同祖先测量共表型距离）和RanBu（对Breiman经典邻近度量应用核平滑）两种浅森林方法，在森林训练后操作，仅需调整单带宽参数h。

Result: RanBu在高噪声环境匹配或超越全深度随机森林准确性，减少高达95%训练和推理时间；DiNo在低噪声环境实现最佳偏差 - 方差权衡。两种方法可扩展到分位数回归。

Conclusion: DiNo和RanBu是有效的浅森林方法，能提升表格预测效率和准确性，代码开源，未来可扩展到其他模式。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

Conclusion: 将预测和学习视为相互强化的过程，推动了预测分析的方法和理论理解，为自适应、数据驱动的知识系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Motivation: 代码推理隐式且含噪声，直接训练原始代码效果不佳，需更好的训练资源提升大语言模型推理能力。

Method: 引入TracePile语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的逐步推理链，采用继续预训练、预训练后指令调优和两阶段微调三种训练设置。

Result: 在四个基础模型和20个基准测试中均有一致提升，如TracePile使LLaMA3.1 - 8B在九个数学数据集上平均提升7.1%，在多个基准测试有明显增益。

Conclusion: TracePile能有效提升大语言模型在数学、代码、逻辑和算法等方面的推理能力。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

Result: 在多领域数据集实验中，该方法在事件级精度和召回率上大幅优于强LLM基线。

Conclusion: 为连接定量推理和语义理解提供新方向，使大语言模型能直接从数值动态解释和预测事件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文提出数据驱动框架学习航空航天复合材料结构健康指标，用两种学习方法结合多域信号处理，实验表明方法有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提取可靠健康指标面临材料特性多变、损伤模式多样等挑战，制造缺陷和服役事件使过程更复杂。

Method: 提出半监督的Diversity - DeepSAD和无监督的DTC - VAE两种方法，用多激励频率导波监测结构，探索多域表征，通过无监督集成学习融合各频率健康指标。

Result: 增强的Diversity - DeepSAD模型性能达81.6%，DTC - VAE性能达92.3%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 所提数据驱动框架有效，能学习到可靠的健康指标。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Motivation: 联邦学习易受梯度泄露攻击，研究DP机制抵御此类攻击的有效性。

Method: 在简单分类任务上评估不同隐私级别下训练的计算机视觉模型性能，在模拟联邦学习环境分析截获梯度的私有数据重建质量。

Result: DP - SGD显著缓解梯度泄露风险，但有模型效用损失；PDP - SGD分类性能好，抗重建攻击无效。

Conclusion: 在分布式学习场景中，需超越理论保证对隐私机制进行实证评估。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

TL;DR: 提出RCPO框架用于大语言模型对齐，结合偏好优化与选择建模，在多个基准测试中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型对齐主要依赖成对偏好优化，忽略了从更丰富人类反馈中学习的机会。

Method: 提出Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO)框架，通过最大似然估计将偏好优化与（排序）选择建模相结合，用两种代表性排序选择模型实例化该框架。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2和Arena - Hard基准测试中，RCPO始终优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: 直接利用排序偏好数据并结合合适的选择模型可实现更有效的对齐，RCPO为将（排序）选择建模纳入大语言模型训练提供了通用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生大量时空数据集，需要高效、有误差界的压缩方法，且仅解码器大语言模型在处理复杂序列数据方面表现出色。

Method: LLMCOMP先将3D场量化为离散令牌，通过Z序曲线排列，采用覆盖引导采样提高训练效率，用时空嵌入训练自回归变压器建模令牌转换，压缩时进行top - k预测，存储排名索引和回退校正确保误差界。

Result: 在多个再分析数据集实验中，LLMCOMP始终优于现有压缩器，在严格误差界下压缩比最高提高30%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型有潜力成为高保真科学数据的通用压缩器。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Conclusion: 提出的SPEAR++攻击解决了SPEAR攻击实用性受限问题，增强了梯度反转攻击在实际中的应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

Result: 方法可用于多种逆问题求解器，在生成步骤数T较小时性能优越，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法能将条件信息自然嵌入生成过程，无需逐步调整超参数，显著提高鲁棒性和稳定性。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Motivation: 解决有限适应性约束下的广义线性上下文老虎机问题，处理两种常见的有限适应性设置。

Method: 设计了B - GLinCB和RS - GLinCB两个算法，分别针对不同的有限适应性设置。

Result: B - GLinCB在M = Ω( log log T )且臂特征向量随机生成时遗憾为O(√T)；RS - GLinCB更新策略O(log²T)次，即使臂特征向量对抗生成时遗憾也为O(√T)，且消除了对关键参数κ的依赖。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效解决有限适应性约束下的广义线性上下文老虎机问题，消除对κ的依赖的方法有独立研究价值。

Abstract: We study the generalized linear contextual bandit problem within the
constraints of limited adaptivity. In this paper, we present two algorithms,
$\texttt{B-GLinCB}$ and $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$, that address, respectively, two
prevalent limited adaptivity settings. Given a budget $M$ on the number of
policy updates, in the first setting, the algorithm needs to decide upfront $M$
rounds at which it will update its policy, while in the second setting it can
adaptively perform $M$ policy updates during its course. For the first setting,
we design an algorithm $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$, that incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
regret when $M = \Omega( \log{\log T} )$ and the arm feature vectors are
generated stochastically. For the second setting, we design an algorithm
$\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$ that updates its policy $\tilde{O}(\log^2 T)$ times and
achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ even when the arm feature vectors
are adversarially generated. Notably, in these bounds, we manage to eliminate
the dependence on a key instance dependent parameter $\kappa$, that captures
non-linearity of the underlying reward model. Our novel approach for removing
this dependence for generalized linear contextual bandits might be of
independent interest.

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Result: 凸显了平衡用户投入与数据质量的挑战，以及SKEL减少标注投入和提高数据收集质量的潜在好处。

Conclusion: SKEL在真实场景中有一定优势，但需平衡用户投入和数据质量。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Conclusion: 通过评估和提出改进方法，能更好应对异构数据环境下联邦学习的问题。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation
model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data
modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic
health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us
(AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex
relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The
methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model
space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on
AoU data demonstrates the model's predictive value for the onset of various
conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay
between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom
classification tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility and efficiency.
This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction,
proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment
strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and
actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare.

Motivation: 解决多模态分子模型3D构象不可靠和模态崩溃问题，提升其鲁棒性和泛化能力

Method: 设计结构化融合管道SFP结合2D拓扑和3D几何，引入渐进注入机制PI将先验信息融入序列流，基于状态空间骨干网络

Conclusion: MuMo对3D构象噪声鲁棒，多模态融合在分子表示中有效

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型对齐技术中奖励模型常利用虚假相关性，引发关注，需减轻奖励模型中的偏差。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减轻了虚假相关问题，得到更稳健的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 所提框架能在保留反映预期偏好的潜在因素的同时，减轻奖励模型中的偏差。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Motivation: 大语言模型作为自主决策代理在高风险领域部署有风险，无架构保障时受提示框架影响大。

Method: 提出Chimera架构，包含LLM策略师、形式验证符号约束引擎和因果推理模块，在电商环境中对其与基线架构进行52周模拟对比。

Result: LLM-only代理表现极差，添加符号约束有改善但利润不如Chimera，Chimera回报最高且提升品牌信任，TLA+形式验证无约束违规。

Conclusion: 架构设计而非提示工程决定生产环境中自主代理的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

Motivation: transformer在高数据吞吐量环境存在部署挑战，其二次复杂度需大量资源且推理延迟高。

Method: 引入受物理学启发的SAL - T，对粒子基于运动学特征进行空间感知分区计算注意力，用卷积层捕捉局部相关性。

Conclusion: SAL - T是解决transformer部署问题的有效方案，代码开源。

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at
https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.

Conclusion: 所提出的物理信息算子学习方法能有效处理多分辨率数据，解决数据获取难和分辨率不同的问题。

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Method: 提出测量可监控性的两个组件（可读性和覆盖率）的方法，用自动评级器提示让大语言模型计算现有CoT的指标。

Result: 应用于前沿模型，发现其具有高可监控性。

Conclusion: 该方法是测量CoT默认可监控性的工具，是对抗性压力测试的补充而非替代。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中KV缓存随着输入文本长度增加带来高昂GPU内存成本，现有方法有数值精度损失或键值对保留不佳问题。

Method: 引入两阶段LRQK框架，在预填充阶段将全精度查询和键矩阵分解为紧凑因子，解码时用低维投影计算代理注意力分数；采用混合GPU - CPU缓存与命中 - 未命中机制。

Result: 在RULER和LongBench基准测试中，LRQK与领先稀疏注意力方法相当或更优，能显著节省内存且精度损失极小。

Conclusion: LRQK是一种有效解决长上下文推理中内存成本问题的方法。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Conclusion: CLP是有效的大语言模型层剪枝框架，能减少计算开销，提升性能保留率，还能与量化结合进一步压缩模型。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

Conclusion: SAEA框架能有效调整交通预测中的自相关误差，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

Conclusion: 未配对偏好优化是扩散语言模型中配对对齐的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出用混合量子 - 经典模型进行肺炎检测，对比经典CNN，QNN有更高准确率，为量子计算融入医疗诊断系统奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在肺炎检测的医学图像分析中存在计算成本高、特征表示有限和小数据集泛化难等问题，需新方法解决。

Method: 使用PneumoniaMNIST数据集，采用带参数化量子电路的量子卷积层处理2x2图像块，将量子提取的特征输入经典神经网络分类。

Result: 提出的QNN验证准确率达83.33%，高于经典CNN的73.33%。

Conclusion: QNN在医学图像分析，尤其在标签数据有限的场景有潜力，为量子计算融入医疗诊断系统提供了计算高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Motivation: 准确绘制农业景观中XCO2分布图对指导减排策略至关重要。

Method: 提出Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST - ViWT)框架，融合小波时频表示与Transformer注意力机制处理多源数据。

Result: 在2024年OCO - 2数据上R2 = 0.984，RMSE = 0.468 ppm；92.3%预测值在+/-1 ppm内；与TCCON独立验证表现好；揭示家禽设施密度与XCO2正相关等。

Conclusion: 该方法能实现无缝CO2表面重建，支持碳排放核算、热点识别和政策评估。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Result: 通过大量实验表明，TEMPEST在准确性上与现有技术相当，同时在内存和计算方面提高了效率。

Conclusion: TEMPEST方法能有效从压缩数据中学习语义表示，降低计算复杂度和内存使用。

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

Result: 在合成核上验证方法，在真实图像数据集上表明恢复的特征值可作为特征选择的有效重要性分数。

Conclusion: 该方法能通过自适应维度表征实现效率 - 准确性的权衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

Motivation: 现有对RLHF的理论理解有限，且现有工作多研究基于奖励的Bradley - Terry偏好模型，本文想研究通用偏好模型。

Method: 考虑通用偏好模型，使用直接基于经验估计的算法（贪婪采样）。

Result: 获得了性能保证，相比现有结果有重大的阶数改进。

Conclusion: 贪婪采样在RLHF中具有令人惊讶的充分性，这源于KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构属性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

Conclusion: 分解策略有效分离时间特征，使各模型专长发挥，提高预测准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

Motivation: MoE模型成为扩展大语言模型核心，但与密集网络的机制差异理解不足，且无法用相同视角解释。

Method: 研究特征稀疏性、特征重要性对MoE的影响，开发衡量专家间叠加的新指标，提出基于单语义特征表示的专家专业化新定义。

Result: 特征稀疏性和特征重要性不会导致不连续相变，网络稀疏性更好表征MoE；网络稀疏性高的模型单语义性更强；专家在适当初始化时会围绕连贯特征组合自然组织。

Conclusion: MoE中的网络稀疏性可在不牺牲性能的情况下使模型更易解释，挑战了可解释性和能力相悖的常见假设。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

Motivation: 现有MSE损失函数有时无法准确捕捉预测范围内的季节性或趋势，即使使用分解模块。

Method: 使用指数移动平均将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，分别计算损失并加权，可与任何深度学习预测模型结合。

Result: 在不同真实世界数据集上显著提升了现有模型的性能。

Conclusion: DBLoss为时间序列损失函数设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

Result: 通过实验表明HIPE在预测准确性、超参数识别和后续优化性能方面优于标准初始化策略，在大批次、少样本场景效果更好。

Conclusion: HIPE策略能有效解决现有贝叶斯优化初始化问题，在实际应用中有良好表现。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

Result: 提出的混合框架在各任务中均优于单分支架构。

Conclusion: 该混合框架在混沌系统预测中稳健且有效。

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未明确提及最终结论，但旨在通过新基准和框架解决VideoLMs在讽刺检测中的问题。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

Conclusion: 研究揭示缓解灾难性遗忘的机制，凸显基于概念、信息论方法构建稳定自适应持续学习系统的潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

Result: 在计算机模拟蛋白质结合剂设计任务中，RSS产生的可设计结构是RSO基线的5倍，结构多样性是2 - 3倍，且计算成本相同。

Conclusion: RSS是有效探索蛋白质设计领域的原则性方法。

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

Method: 系统比较FuXi - ENS和ECMWF - ENS对2018年90个全球热带气旋在相关物理变量、路径和强度预报及相关动力和热力场方面的表现。

Result: FuXi - ENS在预测热带气旋相关物理变量上有明显优势，路径预报更准确且集合离散度降低，但仍低估强度；能更好捕捉大尺度环流，水汽湍能更集中。

Conclusion: 可学习扰动有提升热带气旋预报技能的潜力，为推进基于AI的极端天气集合预报提供见解。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器应用于音频生成存在挑战，如音频压缩会模糊语义且特征表征有限，需对音频生成模型进行可解释分析。

Conclusion: 提出的框架可用于可控操作和分析AI音乐生成过程，且可扩展到视觉潜在空间生成模型的可解释分析。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

*Adela DePavia,Vasileios Charisopoulos,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 自适应梯度方法如Adam和Adagrad在机器学习中广泛使用，但对其泛化效果理解不足。研究指出Adam对特征空间正交变换敏感，会使其优势反转，提出的重参数化方法可恢复其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自适应梯度方法（如Adam）相对梯度下降法在模型泛化上的效果，解决Adam对特征空间正交变换敏感导致优势丧失的问题。

Method: 理论分析Adam对特征空间正交变换的敏感性，采用重参数化方法（对优化目标应用正交变换）并进行实验验证。

Result: 发现即使数据分布小旋转也会使Adam丧失优势，重参数化方法能恢复Adam对复杂决策边界的偏好。

Conclusion: 重参数化方法可赋予一阶方法对数据旋转的等变性，恢复Adam在学习复杂决策边界上的优势。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Motivation: 工业过程产生的复杂数据对故障检测系统构成挑战，现有机器学习技术结果不佳，需开发更好的故障检测框架。

Method: 使用田纳西 - 伊斯曼过程，先尝试标准模型，后采用SHAP转换问题，再通过多种算法生成有向无环图进行因果分析。

Result: 因果结构与SHAP结果一致，突出关键过程元素，提升检测精度。

Conclusion: 这种结合预测能力和因果理解的方法为工业系统故障检测提供了强大工具，开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型微调计算开销大问题，提出从连续低秩增量累积高秩权重更新方法，测试显示性能提升和收敛快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型微调计算开销大，现有低秩适配方法有效果和收敛限制。

Method: 从连续低秩增量累积高秩权重更新，确定每次更新的最优低秩矩阵，通过缩放原低秩矩阵列实现高效优化。

Result: 在多种流行大语言模型和任务测试中，相对现有低秩适配变体有一致性能提升和快速收敛。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能解决现有低秩适配局限，有效提升大语言模型微调性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Motivation: 构建能用于大气数据降尺度且保证物理一致性的模型来重建高分辨率2 - m温度场。

Method: 基于现有扩散架构，采用残差公式，在模型训练目标中加入PDE损失项，通过有限差分近似有效平流 - 扩散平衡来保证物理一致性。

Result: 常规扩散训练已产生低PDE残差，额外损失微调可进一步规范模型，增强生成场的物理合理性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在大气数据降尺度方面显示出有效性，代码开源利于后续研究。

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出新的强化学习框架以更好地对齐大语言模型，解决现有方法存在的问题。

Method: GIFT框架结合GRPO的在线多响应生成和归一化、DPO的隐式奖励公式、UNA的隐式 - 显式奖励对齐原则，联合归一化隐式和显式奖励。

Result: 将复杂奖励最大化目标转化为简单MSE损失，使非凸优化问题变为凸且稳定可微的形式，在数学基准上取得优越推理和对齐性能，计算高效。

Conclusion: GIFT框架有效，相比其他方法有更少超参数、更快收敛、更好泛化性和更少过拟合问题。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Motivation: 电动公交车复杂系统给预测性维护带来挑战，传统维护难以捕捉多维实时CAN总线数据异常，需要新方法进行预测性维护。

Method: 采用基于图的特征选择方法分析CAN总线参数关系，结合统计过滤和基于优化的社区检测算法开发混合特征选择工具，用网格和随机搜索优化机器学习模型，通过SMOTEEN和基于二分搜索的下采样进行数据平衡，用LIME实现模型可解释性。

Result: 所开发系统能有效预测车辆警报，增强特征可解释性。

Conclusion: 该系统支持符合工业4.0原则的主动维护策略。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

Method: 将最优回归树训练重铸为两阶段优化问题，提出RS - ORT算法，分支仅基于树结构变量，引入多种边界收紧技术和可分解上下界策略，采用BB节点分解实现并行执行。

Result: 在多个含二元和连续特征的回归基准测试中，RS - ORT训练和测试性能优于现有方法，在含200万个连续特征样本的数据集上4小时可获保证的训练性能。

Conclusion: RS - ORT算法有效，能缓解计算难题，在回归任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

Method: 利用对训练好的深度神经网络进行组级干预，采用模型不变性测试推断因果关系，分三步：用深度学习联合建模、进行组级干预、开展模型不变性测试。

Result: 在模拟数据集上表现优于现有方法，在真实数据集（脑网络和气候生态系统）上得到验证。

Conclusion: 对深度学习模型应用组级干预结合不变性测试，能有效揭示复杂因果结构，为相关领域提供见解。

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Conclusion: 研究结果推动大规模查询权重冗余研究。

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

Motivation: 学习低精度量化参数时，STE有偏差，ZO梯度计算成本高，需更好方法。

Method: 提出First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (FOGZO)方法，减少STE偏差和ZO计算量。

Result: 在不同模型上有精度或困惑度提升，相同损失下在MNIST的2层MLP上相比n - SPSA计算量减少796倍。

Conclusion: FOGZO在量化感知预训练中有效，改进了质量与训练时间的权衡。

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Conclusion: ChessQA能全面评估模型国际象棋能力和理解，其设置可控、一致，且具有动态性，将提供代码、更新数据集和公开排行榜支持后续研究。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized

analysis indicates that devices based on our architecture could achieve
performance parity with GPUs on a simple image benchmark using approximately

Result: DATE在多种任务中保持模型生成能力，相比固定文本嵌入实现更好的文本图像对齐。

Conclusion: DATE可在不额外训练模型情况下，动态适应文本条件到反向扩散图像，提升文本图像对齐。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

TL;DR: 提出SynCast模型，结合气象和空气成分数据，比现有方法更准确预测PM浓度，为下一代空气质量预警系统提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球健康和环境风险，准确预测PM浓度很重要，但现有模型常低估罕见污染事件。

Method: 构建基于区域适应变压器骨干和扩散随机细化模块的SynCast模型，利用ERA5和CAMS数据集，结合领域目标和极值理论。

Result: 模型在多个PM变量预测上有显著提升，尤其在极端条件下，且不影响全球准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代空气质量预警系统提供可扩展基础，支持脆弱地区气候健康风险缓解。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Motivation: 数值方法解决算子特征值问题受维数灾难阻碍，现有深度学习方法性能依赖算子光谱分布，需提升。

Method: 提出STNet，每次迭代用近似特征值和特征函数对原算子进行光谱变换，采用放缩投影排除已求解子空间，用滤波器变换放大期望区域特征值。

Result: 大量实验表明STNet始终优于现有基于学习的方法，在精度上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: STNet是解决算子特征值问题的有效方法，性能优越。

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: STG能使底层模型分布与安全约束对齐，在实现更安全输出同时最小化对生成质量的影响。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Motivation: PINNs精度依赖配点放置，全局采样稳定但计算成本高，局部采样高效但鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出GLF采样策略，通过对训练点加与残差成反比的高斯噪声生成新配点，引入轻量级线性代理近似全局残差分布。

Result: 在基准PDEs上的大量实验表明，GLF比全局和局部采样策略在准确性和效率上都有提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升PINNs求解复杂高维PDEs的可靠性和效率提供实用可扩展框架。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

Result: 实验结果证实RED能有效缓解负迁移问题，并取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: RED方法能有效缓解负迁移问题，在无监督域自适应中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

Conclusion: RAP框架能生成更符合物理现实的预测，解决了长期预测误差累积问题。

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Conclusion: FolDE方法能有效提高蛋白质优化效率，其开源工作流让实验室均可使用。

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any

### [150] [FALQON: Accelerating LoRA Fine-tuning with Low-Bit Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24061)
*Kanghyun Choi,Hyeyoon Lee,SunJong Park,Dain Kwon,Jinho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出FALQON框架解决FP8量化在低秩自适应（LoRA）中速度提升受限问题，实现约3倍训练加速且无需后训练量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8量化在低秩自适应（LoRA）中因固有量化开销无法有效提速，需解决该局限。

Method: 提出FALQON框架，在微调时将LoRA适配器直接合并到FP8量化主干中，重新制定前向和反向计算，引入行式代理更新机制。

Result: FALQON比现有量化LoRA方法实现约3倍训练加速，精度相近，且端到端FP8工作流无需后训练量化。

Conclusion: FALQON为高效大规模模型微调提供实用解决方案，便于高效部署。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

TL;DR: 提出离散扩散模型的信息论框架，用得分匹配损失得到对数似然的原则性估计，实验验证了估计器的准确性等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为离散扩散模型建立信息论框架，得到对数似然的有效估计。

Method: 受高斯设置的I - MMSE恒等式启发，推导离散设置的类似结果，引入I - MDSE和I - MDCE关系。

Result: 实验表明估计器具有准确性、方差稳定性和实用性。

Conclusion: 常用损失如DSE和DCE是对数似然的紧密且有原则的估计，I - MDCE分解有实际扩展应用。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

Result: 在LIBERO和MetaWorld基准测试中优于多任务和技能学习基线，发现可解释的参数化技能。

Conclusion: 从多任务专家演示中学习参数化技能能显著提高对未见任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

TL;DR: 提出Graph - Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS)方法优化基于图的RAG，在多方面优于基线。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的RAG构建知识图谱时需大量调用LLM，成本高昂，需要优化。

Method: 提出G2ConS，包括选择显著文档块的方法和独立于LLM的概念图。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，G2ConS在构建成本、检索效果和回答质量上都优于所有基线。

Conclusion: G2ConS能有效降低基于图的RAG构建成本，提升检索和回答质量。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Result: 网络类似FIR滤波器，可捕捉频谱特征，有更好可解释性，能简化为等效单层滤波器。

Conclusion: 该方法在模拟和真实数据集上有效，对建模和识别动态响应物理系统有意义。

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

<details>

Motivation: 传统元启发式方法计算成本高、收敛慢，机器学习方法依赖恒定电流数据，需新方法进行锂离子电池参数识别。

Method: 结合NeuralSPMe和基于深度学习的定点迭代方法，NeuralSPMe在真实EV负载曲线训练，PUNet进行定点迭代更新。

Result: 框架使参数识别加速超2000倍，样本效率高，精度比传统元启发式算法高超10倍。

Conclusion: 所提框架在实际应用动态负载场景下表现优异，能有效解决现有方法的问题。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

<details>

Motivation: 复杂耗散系统远离平衡态，其能量耗散和时间不可逆性难从数据量化，学习准确且可解释的动力学模型是主要挑战。

Method: 引入I - OnsagerNet，扩展Onsager原理，保证学习的势能来自平稳密度，漂移可分解为时间可逆和不可逆分量。

Result: 能计算熵产生和量化不可逆性，应用于聚合物拉伸和随机梯度朗之万动力学有新见解，如势垒高度超线性缩放等。

Conclusion: I - OnsagerNet建立了发现和解释非平衡动力学的通用数据驱动框架。

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Conclusion: EddyFormer在大规模湍流模拟中具有良好性能和领域泛化能力，能有效解决复杂湍流问题。

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

Conclusion: V - SAT提供了首个全面且鲁棒的字幕标注解决方案，有人在环验证确保了高质量结果。

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

Conclusion: 物理引导的增强范式有效。

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

Result: PRIVET能在多种数据模态中可靠检测记忆和隐私泄露情况，在有控制的设置下对比现有方法，能提供数据集和样本级评估。

Conclusion: PRIVET算法在隐私泄露检测和评估上有优势，现有计算机视觉嵌入在识别近重复样本时存在局限。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

Result: SOIDS能在数据丰富和匮乏场景同时达到最优最坏情况后悔率，扩展了IDS理论保证。

Conclusion: SOIDS算法可在无贝叶斯假设下，在最坏情况的两种场景实现最优后悔率，且实证表现良好。

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

Result: 在RewardBench和RMBench上平均相对提升4.7%，在下游RLHF性能上平均提升13.6%。

Conclusion: PaTaRM设计有效，能实现高效、可泛化和可解释的奖励建模，代码开源。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及具体结论。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

Method: 提出Sparse Attention in Latent Space (SALS)框架，将KV缓存投影到紧凑潜在空间，进行无RoPE的查询-键交互和稀疏令牌选择，仅重构重要令牌子集。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上评估，SALS实现6.4倍KV缓存压缩和5.7倍注意力算子加速，端到端吞吐量在不同序列长度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: SALS框架在保持竞争力的准确性下达到SOTA性能，能有效解决大语言模型长上下文推理的KV缓存难题。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于方程发现（ED）的二元分类框架EDC，实验显示其优于现有ED分类方法，性能与二元分类的最先进方法相当，还给出适用的语法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方程发现技术多用于回归任务，本文旨在提出基于ED的二元分类框架。

Method: 提出EDC方法寻找可管理大小的解析函数确定决策边界，设计复杂度适中的语法。

Result: 在人工和真实数据实验中，EDC能发现目标方程结构和参数值，优于现有ED分类方法，性能与最先进方法相当，语法可避免过拟合。

Conclusion: EDC是有效的二元分类方法，语法复杂度可配置，能包含特定领域表达式。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯聚类大规模计算需求高，且现实数据有缺失值，简单插补忽略不确定性导致结果不佳。

Method: 将Prior - Data Fitted Networks扩展到无监督贝叶斯聚类，在有限高斯混合模型先验生成的合成数据集上训练。

Result: 比AIC、BIC和变分推理更准确估计簇数量，聚类质量与变分推理相当且速度更快，在高缺失率的真实基因组数据集上优于基于插补的基线。

Conclusion: Cluster - PFN可提供可扩展和灵活的贝叶斯聚类。

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

Motivation: ICL在大语言模型中被广泛研究，但在VLMs中的有效性尚未充分探索，故进行系统研究。

Method: 对涵盖四种架构的七个模型在三个图像字幕基准上进行评估，分析提示设计、架构选择和训练策略对多模态ICL的影响，分析注意力模式变化。

Result: 图像-文本交错数据训练可提升ICL性能，但未有效整合示范信息；指令调优增强指令遵循但降低对上下文示范的依赖；当前VLMs主要关注文本线索，多模态整合能力有限。

Conclusion: 指出当前VLMs的ICL能力存在关键局限，为提升其从多模态上下文示例中学习的能力提供见解。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险领域常未考虑不确定性，需提升预测可靠性

Method: 第一步用实例硬度过滤训练数据，第二步推理时用基于置信度的拒绝机制

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上验证能提升模型可靠性，平衡预测性能与拒绝率，集成方法有效且保留大部分实例

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键应用中部署机器学习系统提供实用方案

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

Method: 提出Representativeness - Privacy - Utility (RPU)框架，从三个互补维度和三个层次评估合成出行数据，并用该框架对比12种生成方法。

Result: 合成数据不天然保证隐私，无通用模型，隐私与代表性/效用权衡明显，CTGAN权衡最平衡。

Conclusion: RPU框架为研究者和从业者在公交应用中比较合成数据生成技术和选择合适方法提供系统、可重复的基础。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

Motivation: 当前CSL规模大，常规虚拟筛选只能评估少量化合物，且现有算法难以适应筛选过程中约束和目标的变化。

Method: 提出APEX协议，利用神经网络代理预测目标和约束，在消费级GPU上实现全枚举；开发包含超1000万化合物的基准CSL。

Result: APEX在检索准确性和运行时间上相比其他方法表现出色。

Conclusion: APEX能有效解决大规模CSL虚拟筛选的难题，具有良好的性能。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的混合离线到在线范式能有效减少稀疏奖励环境的探索负担，提高样本效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Conclusion: COMBRL是一种可扩展且样本高效的连续时间基于模型的强化学习方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet

fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock

treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

Method: 基于渐近分析建立数据感知的LoRA初始化理论框架，推导含偏差项和方差项的优化问题，开发算法LoRA - DA从少量目标域样本估计优化问题的项。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LoRA - DA持续提高最终准确率，收敛更快更稳定，跨秩鲁棒性好，初始化开销小。

Conclusion: LoRA - DA是一种有效的LoRA初始化方法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Result: DistDF改善了多种预测模型的性能，达到了最先进的预测水平。

Conclusion: DistDF是一种有效的时间序列预测方法，能提升预测模型性能。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing

propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable

Motivation: 多数ILP算法单次训练学习单个假设，集成方法需多次训练，本文旨在探索更高效方法。

Method: 仅训练一次ILP算法，保存中间假设，用最小描述长度加权方案组合假设。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法将预测准确率提高4%，计算开销小于1%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能在较少计算开销下提高预测准确率。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出DOTS方法解决时间序列因果发现问题，集成多个因果顺序，实验证明其优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列因果发现受组合复杂性阻碍，传统排序方法限制模型表示能力。

Method: 提出DOTS方法，利用基于扩散的因果发现，集成多个有效因果顺序，在标准假设下形式化问题，利用得分匹配和扩散过程进行高效Hessian估计。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DOTS优于现有基线，在合成基准上提高mean window - graph F1，在真实基准上获得最高平均summary - graph F1并减少运行时间。

Conclusion: DOTS是时间序列因果发现的可扩展且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Method: 对鲁棒性比率ρ在(0,1)的整个范围进行细粒度分析，给出参数数量作为ρ的函数的上下界。

Result: 得到比现有结果更严格的上下界，发现ρ较小时鲁棒记忆与非鲁棒记忆参数复杂度匹配，ρ增大时参数复杂度增长。

Conclusion: 明确了ReLU网络鲁棒记忆参数复杂度与鲁棒性比率的变化关系。

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Conclusion: Pearl模型有效解决现有问题，提升蛋白质 - 配体复合物结构预测性能。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Motivation: 在众多自动驾驶的深度强化学习方法中，很少使用选项框架，而该框架适合分层控制和自动驾驶任务，因此将其应用于高速公路自动驾驶。

Method: 定义纵向和横向操作的专用选项，嵌入安全和舒适约束；提出分层控制设置，采用先进强化学习技术推导实用算法。

Result: 通过分别选择纵向和横向控制动作，组合和混合选项的策略具有与人类驾驶员相同的表达性和灵活性，且比传统连续动作策略更易解释；混合选项的灵活策略在不同交通条件下表现最佳，优于基于动作的基线策略。

Conclusion: 将选项框架应用于高速公路自动驾驶任务是有效的，混合选项策略在自动驾驶中具有优势。

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

TL;DR: 提出CG - ALR方法动态调整学习率，受大脑连接组启发，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑功能连接可自适应重配置，而人工神经网络学习率通常手动调整或使用通用优化器，对模型内部动态不敏感，因此需要设计更自适应的学习率调整方法。

Method: 提出Connectome - Guided Automatic Learning Rate (CG - ALR)，在每次训练迭代中从神经元共激活构建神经网络的功能连接组，并根据连接组重配置在线调整学习率。

Result: 基于大脑连接组原理设计的自适应学习率方法通常优于传统基于SGD的调度和近期方法。

Conclusion: 大脑连接组原理可用于指导深度学习中自适应学习率的设计。

Abstract: The human brain is highly adaptive: its functional connectivity reconfigures
on multiple timescales during cognition and learning, enabling flexible
information processing. By contrast, artificial neural networks typically rely
on manually-tuned learning-rate schedules or generic adaptive optimizers whose
hyperparameters remain largely agnostic to a model's internal dynamics. In this
paper, we propose Connectome-Guided Automatic Learning Rate (CG-ALR) that
dynamically constructs a functional connectome of the neural network from
neuron co-activations at each training iteration and adjusts learning rates
online as this connectome reconfigures. This connectomics-inspired mechanism
adapts step sizes to the network's dynamic functional organization, slowing
learning during unstable reconfiguration and accelerating it when stable
organization emerges. Our results demonstrate that principles inspired by brain
connectomes can inform the design of adaptive learning rates in deep learning,
generally outperforming traditional SGD-based schedules and recent methods.

Motivation: 传统脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的二进制脉冲特性导致信息损失和精度下降，需改进。

Method: 提出多级脉冲神经元模型，提出新的残差架构Sparse - ResNet。

Result: 多级SNNs在图像分类中降低2到3倍能耗，在神经形态数据上推理延迟降至1个时间步；Sparse - ResNet在图像分类有先进精度，网络活动降低超20%。

Conclusion: 多级脉冲神经元模型和Sparse - ResNet架构能有效提升SNNs性能。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are one of the most promising bio-inspired
neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The
event-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and
theoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However,
the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable
information loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both
low-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the
performance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental
results with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level
spiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a
reduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on
image classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to
3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization
intervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce
the inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor
of 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we
propose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a
careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight
a spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures.
Using our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy
results in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network
activity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.

TL;DR: 文章引入三个资源推进可视化编码代理，实验显示VisCoder2表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可视化编码代理模型在实际工作流中因语言覆盖有限、执行不可靠和缺乏迭代修正机制而失败，且受窄数据集和基准测试限制。

Method: 引入VisCode - Multi - 679K数据集、VisPlotBench基准测试，训练VisCoder2多语言可视化模型。

Result: VisCoder2显著优于开源基线，接近GPT - 4.1性能，迭代自调试后执行通过率达82.4%。

Conclusion: 所提出的资源有助于推进可视化编码代理的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of
generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing
models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage,
unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has
been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round
generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents.
VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K
validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction
dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for
systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and
protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we
present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on
VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms
strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary
models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching
82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or
compiler-dependent languages.

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic AI is fundamentally transforming how software is
designed, developed, and maintained. Traditional software development
methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for
human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where
autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous
learning. To address this methodological gap, we present "Agentsway" a novel
software development framework designed for ecosystems where AI agents operate
as first-class collaborators. Agentsway introduces a structured lifecycle
centered on human orchestration, and privacy-preserving collaboration among
specialized AI agents. The framework defines distinct roles for planning,
prompting, coding, testing, and fine-tuning agents, each contributing to
iterative improvement and adaptive learning throughout the development process.
By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from
different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective
learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable
decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible
AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated
use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring
balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances
software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating
privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity
and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation
of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first research effort to introduce a dedicated
methodology explicitly designed for AI agent-based software engineering teams.

Conclusion: 提高模型自我反思质量是加强AI生成代码安全性的有效实用策略。

Abstract: Security in code generation remains a pivotal challenge when applying large
language models (LLMs). This paper introduces RefleXGen, an innovative method
that significantly enhances code security by integrating Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques with guided self-reflection mechanisms inherent in
LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fine-tuning LLMs or developing
specialized secure code datasets - processes that can be resource-intensive -
RefleXGen iteratively optimizes the code generation process through
self-assessment and reflection without the need for extensive resources. Within
this framework, the model continuously accumulates and refines its knowledge
base, thereby progressively improving the security of the generated code.
Experimental results demonstrate that RefleXGen substantially enhances code
security across multiple models, achieving a 13.6% improvement with GPT-3.5
Turbo, a 6.7% improvement with GPT-4o, a 4.5% improvement with CodeQwen, and a
5.8% improvement with Gemini. Our findings highlight that improving the quality
of model self-reflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for
strengthening the security of AI-generated code.

Motivation: 解决仓库级软件工程问题，提升软件工程中测试解决的效率和质量。

Method: TDFlow工作流将软件程序修复分解为四个组件，由各自子代理控制，反复提出、修订和调试仓库级补丁。

Result: TDFlow在SWE - Bench Lite上通过率达88.8%，SWE - Bench Verified上达94.3%，800次运行中仅7例测试作弊。

Conclusion: 现代大语言模型嵌入测试驱动工作流可实现人类级测试解决，全自主仓库修复的关键是准确生成有效重现测试。

Abstract: We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames
repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically
designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly
proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely
engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes
software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective
sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch
revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any
individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined
sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific
sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on
SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and
94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within
SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which
were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary
obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing
successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system
powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems.
Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly
engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution
-- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the
accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.

Motivation: 系统互操作性面临挑战且有经济成本，随着大语言模型发展，旨在分析基于LLM的策略使系统在运行时自主互操作的有效性。

Method: 选择13个开源LLM，整理农业互操作用例的四个版本数据集，用两种策略对每个模型和数据集版本进行三次运行，比较模型有效性和结果一致性。

Result: qwen2.5 - coder:32b在多数数据集版本中使用两种策略表现最佳，在含单位转换的数据集版本中，DIRECT策略失败，CODEGEN策略qwen2.5 - coder:32b成功。

Conclusion: 部分LLM可使系统自主互操作，建议在不同领域进一步评估和开展可靠性策略研究。

Abstract: Background: Systems of systems are becoming increasingly dynamic and
heterogeneous, and this adds pressure on the long-standing challenge of
interoperability. Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an
economic side, as development time efforts are required to build the
interoperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field
of large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of
LLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,
without human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated
four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We
performed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two
different strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the
consistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b
was the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=
0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset
versions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all
models using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN
qwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some
LLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in
different domains is recommended, and further research on reliability
strategies should be conducted.

Result: 工程师能在设计时调整规则，常规验证警报触发行为，避免运行时问题。

Conclusion: OXN的新警报扩展有助于解决警报设计难题。

Abstract: Observability and alerting form the backbone of modern reliability
engineering. Alerts help teams catch faults early before they turn into
production outages and serve as first clues for troubleshooting. However,
designing effective alerts is challenging. They need to strike a fine balance
between catching issues early and minimizing false alarms. On top of this,
alerts often cover uncommon faults, so the code is rarely executed and
therefore rarely checked. To address these challenges, several industry
practitioners advocate for testing alerting code with the same rigor as
application code. Still, there's a lack of tools that support such systematic
design and validation of alerts.
  This paper introduces a new alerting extension for the observability
experimentation tool OXN. It lets engineers experiment with alerts early during
development. With OXN, engineers can now tune rules at design time and
routinely validate the firing behavior of their alerts, avoiding future
problems at runtime.

Conclusion: 该框架有效且有韧性，各中间工件对代码质量有贡献，状态机建模影响最大。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has advanced automatic code
generation, yet most approaches rely on direct, single-step translation from
problem descriptions to code, disregarding structured software engineering
practices. We introduce a lifecycle-aware framework that systematically
incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state
machine modeling, and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages.
This design aligns code generation with standard software development phases
and enables more structured reasoning. Experiments show that lifecycle-level
fine-tuning improves code correctness by up to 75% over the same model before
fine-tuning, with performance gains compounding across intermediate stages.
Multi-step inference consistently surpasses single-step generation,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intermediate scaffolding. Notably,
open-source LLMs, once fine-tuned under our framework, match or slightly
outperform models pretrained on code. When applied to DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B, our
framework yields relative CodeBLEU improvements of 34.3%, 20.0%, 11.2%, and
22.3% over ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and LLaMA-8B,
respectively. Our pipeline also proves robust with up to 80\% less training
data, confirming its resilience. Ablation studies further reveal that each
intermediate artifact contributes distinctly to final code quality, with state
machine modeling yielding the most substantial impact. Our source code and
detailed experimental data are available at

Abstract: Production machine learning (ML) systems fail silently -- not with crashes,
but through wrong decisions. While observability is recognized as critical for
ML operations, there is a lack empirical evidence of what practitioners
actually capture. This study presents empirical results on ML observability in
practice through seven focus group sessions in several domains. We catalog the
information practitioners systematically capture across ML systems and their
environment and map how they use it to validate models, detect and diagnose
faults, and explain observed degradations. Finally, we identify gaps in current
practice and outline implications for tooling design and research to establish
ML observability practices.

TL;DR: 研究基于大语言模型工具生成的软件是否存在老化现象，通过负载测试发现存在明显老化特征，为后续研究提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成软件尤其是大语言模型生成的代码被广泛应用，但对其长期可靠性了解甚少，因此研究这类软件的老化现象。

Method: 利用Bolt平台和Baxbench的标准化提示生成四个面向服务的应用程序，进行50小时负载测试，持续监控资源使用、响应时间和吞吐量。

Result: 发现显著的软件老化证据，包括内存渐进式增长、响应时间增加和性能不稳定，不同类型应用老化严重程度有差异。

Conclusion: 自动生成软件需要考虑老化问题，研究为缓解策略和长期可靠性评估研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Automatically generated software, especially code produced by Large Language
Models (LLMs), is increasingly adopted to accelerate development and reduce
manual effort. However, little is known about the long-term reliability of such
systems under sustained execution. In this paper, we experimentally investigate
the phenomenon of software aging in applications generated by LLM-based tools.
Using the Bolt platform and standardized prompts from Baxbench, we generated
four service-oriented applications and subjected them to 50-hour load tests.
Resource usage, response time, and throughput were continuously monitored to
detect degradation patterns. The results reveal significant evidence of
software aging, including progressive memory growth, increased response time,
and performance instability across all applications. Statistical analyzes
confirm these trends and highlight variability in the severity of aging
according to the type of application. Our findings show the need to consider
aging in automatically generated software and provide a foundation for future
studies on mitigation strategies and long-term reliability evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出多图注意力框架MAGNET用于代码克隆检测，在两个数据集上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码克隆检测方法多依赖单一表示，混合方法融合策略手工设计且效果不佳。

Method: 提出MAGNET框架，结合残差图神经网络与节点级自注意力，引入门控交叉注意力机制，采用Set2Set池化。

Result: 在BigCloneBench和Google Code Jam上F1分数分别达96.5%和99.2%，消融实验验证了多图融合和各注意力组件的重要性。

Conclusion: MAGNET在代码克隆检测任务中表现优秀，代码开源。

Abstract: Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that
underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability
analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as
abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs
(DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches
have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and
ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional
framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture
syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual
graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and
long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for
fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse
multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive
experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and
99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical
contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is

Motivation: GenAI工具在软件开发中被广泛采用，但关于其何时何地真正提高生产力的证据不明确，因此研究其对开发者生产力不同维度的影响。

Method: 通过SPACE框架对415名软件从业者进行调查，了解他们对AI辅助开发中生产力变化的看法。

Result: 按AI使用频率分类的结果显示，整体生产力变化有限，开发者速度变快但不一定能创造更好软件或更有成就感。

Conclusion: GenAI采用存在生产力悖论，速度提升不代表软件质量和满足感提升。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are increasingly being adopted in software
development as productivity aids. However, evidence regarding where and when
these tools actually enhance productivity is unclear. In this paper, we
investigate how GenAI adoption affects different dimensions of developer
productivity. We surveyed 415 software practitioners to capture their
perceptions of productivity changes associated with AI-assisted development
using the SPACE framework - Satisfaction and well-being, Performance, Activity,
Communication and collaboration, and Efficiency and flow. Our results,
disaggregated by frequency of AI usage, reveal limited overall productivity
change, highlighting the productivity paradox in which developers become faster
but do not necessarily create better software or feel more fulfilled.

Conclusion: PRDBench为代码代理和评估代理的评估提供了可扩展且稳健的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in code agents have enabled automated software development at
the project level, supported by large language models (LLMs) and widely adopted
tools. However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major
limitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid
evaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these
challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that
leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging
project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel
benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with
structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive
evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data
sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an
Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of
various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench
demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents
and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation
and evaluation.

Conclusion: 希望通过工作促进LLM-as-a-Judge框架的研究和采用，提高软件工件评估的可扩展性。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software
engineering (SE) has revolutionized tasks like code generation, producing a
massive volume of software artifacts. This surge has exposed a critical
bottleneck: the lack of scalable, reliable methods to evaluate these outputs.
Human evaluation is costly and time-consuming, while traditional automated
metrics like BLEU fail to capture nuanced quality aspects. In response, the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm - using LLMs for automated evaluation - has emerged.
This approach leverages the advanced reasoning of LLMs, offering a path toward
human-like nuance at automated scale. However, LLM-as-a-Judge research in SE is
still in its early stages. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the
community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLM-generated software
artifacts. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies, analyze their
limitations, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap. We
envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates
capable of consistent, multi-faceted artifact evaluation by 2030. Our work aims
to foster research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, ultimately
improving the scalability of software artifact evaluation.

Motivation: 开发者理解代码库耗时久，现有LLM在仓库级文档生成存在缺陷，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: CodeWiki采用分层分解、递归代理处理和文本与视觉工件合成三项创新技术，还推出CodeWikiBench基准。

Result: CodeWiki使用专有模型质量得分68.79%，开源替代方案得分64.80%，优于现有闭源系统。

Conclusion: CodeWiki能为真实世界仓库提供可扩展、准确的文档。

Abstract: Developers spend nearly 58% of their time understanding codebases, yet
maintaining comprehensive documentation remains challenging due to complexity
and manual effort. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
function-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where
capturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential. We
introduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic
repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki
employs three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves
architectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic
delegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including
architecture diagrams and data flows. We also present CodeWikiBench, the first
repository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic
assessment. CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and
64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source
systems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world
repositories.

future at all for SE. This essay is a slightly dark take about what I saw at
that event, very loosely based on the discussions that took place, adding some
healthy sarcasm and cynicism, the intellectual salt and pepper I never seem to
run out of. I listened to the brilliant people who gathered to talk about where
we're headed, and distilled three nightmares headed in our direction: software
makers who don't know what they're doing, but get the job done anyway, a field
moving so fast it can't remember its own lessons, and technologies multiplying
like rabbits in Spring. So, let's start. The future, eh? The future of software

Abstract: We develop \emph{Entropy-Guided Multiplicative Updates} (EGMU), a convex
optimization framework for constructing multi-factor target-exposure portfolios
by minimizing Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence from a benchmark subject to
linear factor constraints. Our contributions are theoretical and algorithmic.
(\emph{i}) We formalize feasibility and uniqueness: with strictly positive
benchmark and feasible targets in the convex hull of exposures, the solution is
unique and strictly positive. (\emph{ii}) We derive the dual concave program
with gradient $t-\E_{w(\theta)}[x]$ and Hessian $-\Cov_{w(\theta)}(x)$, and
give a precise sensitivity formula $\partial\theta^*/\partial
t=\Cov_{w^*}(x)^{-1}$ and $\partial w^*/\partial t=\mathrm{diag}(w^*)
(X-\1\mu^\top)\Cov_{w^*}(x)^{-1}$. (\emph{iii}) We present two provably
convergent solvers: a damped \emph{dual Newton} method with global convergence
and local quadratic rate, and a \emph{KL-projection} scheme based on
IPF/Bregman--Dykstra for equalities and inequalities. (\emph{iv}) We further
\textbf{generalize EGMU} with \emph{elastic targets} (strongly concave dual)
and \emph{robust target sets} (support-function dual), and introduce a
\emph{path-following ODE} for solution trajectories, all reusing the same
dual-moment structure and solved via Newton or proximal-gradient schemes.
(\emph{v}) We detail numerically stable and scalable implementations
(LogSumExp, covariance regularization, half-space KL-projections). We emphasize
theory and reproducible algorithms; empirical benchmarking is optional.

Abstract: We formalize the paradox of an omniscient yet lazy investor - a perfectly

frictions. Starting from a deterministic geometric construction, we derive a
closed-form expected profit function linking trading frequency, execution cost,
and path roughness. We prove existence and uniqueness of the optimal trading
frequency and show that this optimum can be interpreted through the fractal
dimension of the price path. A stochastic extension under fractional Brownian
motion provides analytical expressions for the optimal interval and comparative
statics with respect to the Hurst exponent. Empirical illustrations on equity
data confirm the theoretical scaling behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B测试在实际应用中常无法给出可靠结果，常用的成对t检验在数据分布和样本量差异情况下不可信，需要解决错误率控制和测试可靠性问题。

Method: 量化数据偏态、长尾和样本分配不均对错误率的影响，推导t检验有效的最小样本量公式，引入基于Edgeworth的校正方法。

Result: 许多在线反馈指标需数亿样本才能确保可靠的A/B测试，基于Edgeworth的校正方法在有限样本量下能提供更准确的p值，离线实验证实理论最小样本量阈值和校正方法的实用价值。

Conclusion: 提出的理论最小样本量阈值和校正方法能显著提高现实条件下A/B测试的可靠性。

Abstract: A/B testing has become the cornerstone of decision-making in online markets,
guiding how platforms launch new features, optimize pricing strategies, and
improve user experience. In practice, we typically employ the pairwise $t$-test
to compare outcomes between the treatment and control groups, thereby assessing
the effectiveness of a given strategy. To be trustworthy, these experiments
must keep Type I error (i.e., false positive rate) under control; otherwise, we
may launch harmful strategies. However, in real-world applications, we find
that A/B testing often fails to deliver reliable results. When the data
distribution departs from normality or when the treatment and control groups
differ in sample size, the commonly used pairwise $t$-test is no longer
trustworthy. In this paper, we quantify how skewed, long tailed data and
unequal allocation distort error rates and derive explicit formulas for the
minimum sample size required for the $t$-test to remain valid. We find that
many online feedback metrics require hundreds of millions samples to ensure
reliable A/B testing. Thus we introduce an Edgeworth-based correction that
provides more accurate $p$-values when the available sample size is limited.
Offline experiments on a leading A/B testing platform corroborate the practical
value of our theoretical minimum sample size thresholds and demonstrate that
the corrected method substantially improves the reliability of A/B testing in
real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 在构建反映重参数化几何形状的推理机制时，应用于深度神经网络的近似贝叶斯推理并非毫无希望。

Abstract: Variational mean field approximations tend to struggle with contemporary
overparametrized deep neural networks. Where a Bayesian treatment is usually
associated with high-quality predictions and uncertainties, the practical
reality has been the opposite, with unstable training, poor predictive power,
and subpar calibration. Building upon recent work on reparametrizations of
neural networks, we propose a simple variational family that considers two
independent linear subspaces of the parameter space. These represent functional
changes inside and outside the support of training data. This allows us to
build a fully-correlated approximate posterior reflecting the
overparametrization that tunes easy-to-interpret hyperparameters. We develop
scalable numerical routines that maximize the associated evidence lower bound
(ELBO) and sample from the approximate posterior. Empirically, we observe
state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models, and datasets compared to a
wide array of baseline methods. Our results show that approximate Bayesian
inference applied to deep neural networks is far from a lost cause when
constructing inference mechanisms that reflect the geometry of
reparametrizations.

Conclusion: 能以有意义的贝叶斯方式利用BNN的可扩展性。

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in the output of a neural network is essential
for deployment in scientific or engineering applications where decisions must
be made under limited or noisy data. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a
framework for this purpose by constructing a Bayesian posterior distribution
over the network parameters. However, the prior, which is of key importance in
any Bayesian setting, is rarely meaningful for BNNs. This is because the
complexity of the input-to-output map of a BNN makes it difficult to understand
how certain distributions enforce any interpretable constraint on the output
space. Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in
uncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is
that GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often
rely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these
challenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors,
such that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified
GP. The method works by defining a prior directly over the network parameters
from the Mercer representation of the covariance kernel, and does not rely on
the network having a specific structure. In doing so, we can exploit the
scalability of BNNs in a meaningful Bayesian way.

Result: 实验验证理论见解，方法有效提高公平性并保留预测性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效平衡预测效用和公平性。

Abstract: Machine learning models have achieved widespread success but often inherit
and amplify historical biases, resulting in unfair outcomes. Traditional
fairness methods typically impose constraints at the prediction level, without
addressing underlying biases in data representations. In this work, we propose
a principled framework that adjusts data representations to balance predictive
utility and fairness. Using sufficient dimension reduction, we decompose the
feature space into target-relevant, sensitive, and shared components, and
control the fairness-utility trade-off by selectively removing sensitive
information. We provide a theoretical analysis of how prediction error and
fairness gaps evolve as shared subspaces are added, and employ influence
functions to quantify their effects on the asymptotic behavior of parameter
estimates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our
theoretical insights and show that the proposed method effectively improves
fairness while preserving predictive performance.

Conclusion: 提供了基于受限Langevin扩散和基于局部时间反射扩散的模型的全面比较。

Abstract: Score-based generative models based on stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) achieve impressive performance in sampling from unknown distributions,
but often fail to satisfy underlying constraints. We propose a constrained
generative model using kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics with specular
reflection of velocity on the boundary defining constraints. This results in
piecewise continuously differentiable noising and denoising process where the
latter is characterized by a time-reversed dynamics restricted to a domain with
boundary due to specular boundary condition. In addition, we also contribute to
existing reflected SDEs based constrained generative models, where the
stochastic dynamics is restricted through an abstract local time term. By
presenting efficient numerical samplers which converge with optimal rate in
terms of discretizations step, we provide a comprehensive comparison of models
based on confined (specularly reflected kinetic) Langevin diffusion with models
based on reflected diffusion with local time.

TL;DR: 提出Copula - Stein Discrepancy (CSD)解决标准KSD对高阶依赖结构不敏感问题，进行理论分析，拓展到非阿基米德Copulas，计算上有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准KSD对高阶依赖结构（如尾部依赖）不敏感，而这些结构在科学和金融领域很关键，故提出CSD。

Method: 直接在Copula密度上定义Stein算子，利用依赖的生成结构，而非联合密度的得分函数，对阿基米德Copulas推导闭式Stein核。

Result: 证明CSD能度量Copula分布的弱收敛，经验估计器以最优速率收敛，对尾部依赖系数差异敏感，拓展到非阿基米德Copulas，计算有优势。

Conclusion: CSD是一个实用且理论上有原则的依赖感知推理工具。

Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have become a principal tool for
goodness-of-fit testing, but standard KSDs are often insensitive to
higher-order dependency structures, such as tail dependence, which are critical
in many scientific and financial domains. We address this gap by introducing
the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD), a novel class of discrepancies tailored to
the geometry of statistical dependence. By defining a Stein operator directly
on the copula density, CSD leverages the generative structure of dependence,
rather than relying on the joint density's score function. For the broad class
of Archimedean copulas, this approach yields a closed-form Stein kernel derived
from the scalar generator function. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
analysis, proving that CSD (i) metrizes weak convergence of copula
distributions, ensuring it detects any mismatch in dependence; (ii) has an
empirical estimator that converges at the minimax optimal rate of
$O_P(n^{-1/2})$; and (iii) is provably sensitive to differences in tail
dependence coefficients. The framework is extended to general non-Archimedean
copulas, including elliptical and vine copulas. Computationally, the exact CSD
kernel evaluation scales linearly in dimension, while a novel random feature
approximation reduces the $n$-dependence from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to near-linear
$\tilde{O}(n)$, making CSD a practical and theoretically principled tool for
dependence-aware inference.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the adversarial linear bandits problem and present a unified
algorithmic framework that bridges Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and
Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) methods, extending the known connection
between them from the full-information setting. Within this framework, we
introduce self-concordant perturbations, a family of probability distributions
that mirror the role of self-concordant barriers previously employed in the
FTRL-based SCRiBLe algorithm. Using this idea, we design a novel FTPL-based
algorithm that combines self-concordant regularization with efficient
stochastic exploration. Our approach achieves a regret of $O(d\sqrt{n \ln n})$
on both the $d$-dimensional hypercube and the Euclidean ball. On the Euclidean
ball, this matches the rate attained by existing self-concordant FTRL methods.
For the hypercube, this represents a $\sqrt{d}$ improvement over these methods
and matches the optimal bound up to logarithmic factors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析GAMs和神经网络这两类模型在真实表格数据上的表现。

Method: 按PRISMA指南对比较GAMs和神经网络的论文进行系统评价，提取关键属性，用混合效应模型分析性能指标。

Result: 在常用指标上两者无一致优越性，神经网络在大数据集表现好，优势随时间缩小，GAMs在小数据集有竞争力且具可解释性。

Conclusion: GAMs和神经网络应视为互补方法，很多表格应用中性能权衡不大，可解释性上GAMs更优。

Abstract: Neural networks have become a popular tool in predictive modelling, more
commonly associated with machine learning and artificial intelligence than with
statistics. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) are flexible non-linear
statistical models that retain interpretability. Both are state-of-the-art in
their own right, with their respective advantages and disadvantages. This paper
analyses how these two model classes have performed on real-world tabular data.
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of papers that
performed empirical comparisons of GAMs and neural networks. Eligible papers
were identified, yielding 143 papers, with 430 datasets. Key attributes at both
paper and dataset levels were extracted and reported. Beyond summarising
comparisons, we analyse reported performance metrics using mixed-effects
modelling to investigate potential characteristics that can explain and
quantify observed differences, including application area, study year, sample
size, number of predictors, and neural network complexity. Across datasets, no
consistent evidence of superiority was found for either GAMs or neural networks
when considering the most frequently reported metrics (RMSE, $R^2$, and AUC).
Neural networks tended to outperform in larger datasets and in those with more
predictors, but this advantage narrowed over time. Conversely, GAMs remained
competitive, particularly in smaller data settings, while retaining
interpretability. Reporting of dataset characteristics and neural network
complexity was incomplete in much of the literature, limiting transparency and
reproducibility. This review highlights that GAMs and neural networks should be
viewed as complementary approaches rather than competitors. For many tabular
applications, the performance trade-off is modest, and interpretability may
favour GAMs.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯最优设置为特征学习机制中深度、非线性和有限宽度对神经网络的影响提供了见解，且可能有更广泛相关性。

Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to
analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to
tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going
beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively
answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer
perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it
more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive
than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the
challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and
data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider
the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of
learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the
sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network
as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various
learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through
model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for
training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by
the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating
from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer.
Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the
Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and
finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning
regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.

Abstract: The Wasserstein distance, also known as the Earth mover distance or optimal
transport distance, is a widely used measure of similarity between probability
distributions. This paper presents an linear programming based implementation
of the multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance function in Scipy, a powerful
scientific computing package in Python. Building upon the existing
one-dimensional scipy.stats.wasserstein_distance function, our work extends its
capabilities to handle multi-dimensional distributions. To compute the
multi-dimensional Wasserstein distance, we developed an implementation that
transforms the problem into a linear programming problem. We utilized the scipy
linear programming solver to effectively solve this transformed problem. The
proposed implementation includes thorough documentation and comprehensive test
cases to ensure accuracy and reliability. The resulting feature is set to be
merged into the main Scipy development branch and will be included in the
upcoming release, further enhancing the capabilities of Scipy in the field of
multi-dimensional statistical analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的快速贝叶斯MLQMC方法能有效处理单级和多级问题，误差估计可靠。

Abstract: Existing multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo (MLQMC) methods often rely on multiple
independent randomizations of a low-discrepancy (LD) sequence to estimate
statistical errors on each level. While this approach is standard, it can be
less efficient than simply increasing the number of points from a single LD
sequence. However, a single LD sequence does not permit statistical error
estimates in the current framework. We propose to recast the MLQMC problem in a
Bayesian cubature framework, which uses a single LD sequence and quantifies
numerical error through the posterior variance of a Gaussian process (GP)
model. When paired with certain LD sequences, GP regression and hyperparameter
optimization can be carried out at only $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ cost, where $n$
is the number of samples. Building on the adaptive sample allocation used in
traditional MLQMC, where the number of samples is doubled on the level with the
greatest expected benefit, we introduce a new Bayesian utility function that
balances the computational cost of doubling against the anticipated reduction
in posterior uncertainty. We also propose a new digitally-shift-invariant (DSI)
kernel of adaptive smoothness, which combines multiple higher-order DSI kernels
through a weighted sum of smoothness parameters, for use with fast digital net
GPs. A series of numerical experiments illustrate the performance of our fast
Bayesian MLQMC method and error estimates for both single-level problems and
multilevel problems with a fixed number of levels. The Bayesian error estimates
obtained using digital nets are found to be reliable, although, in some cases,
mildly conservative.

Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy
capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded
modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output
feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned

study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage,
illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between
legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our
findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication,
to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix
and $\mathbf{e}$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $\mathbf{y} =
\mathbf{A} x^* + \mathbf{e}$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing
$x^*$-hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^*$-that is uniformly
recoverable from $\mathbf{y}$ without knowing $\mathbf{e}$. While exact
recovery of $x^*$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on
$\mathbf{A}$ or $x^*$ (for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well
studied, recoverability for arbitrary $\mathbf{A}$ and $x^*$ remains open. Our
main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^* +
\ker(\mathbf{U})$, where $\mathbf{U}$ is the unique projection matrix onto the
intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $\mathbf{A}$ obtained
by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the
$\ell_0$-norm of $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A} x$ lies in $x^* + \ker(\mathbf{U})$,
which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.

Conclusion: 所提双思维世界模型在无线通信网络中能有效解决现有RL方法的局限，具有更好的数据效率、泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks,
existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL)
are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot
generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns
rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These
limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with
high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these
limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning
framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of
information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive
psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven
System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and
logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over
reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end
differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended
horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment
interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model
can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals
without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient
decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based
on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with
material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong
generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the
state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.

Result: SAND相比现有方法检测准确率最多提升18.3%，对规避型木马有高弹性，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: SAND框架在硬件木马检测方面表现优秀，能有效应对多样攻击。

Abstract: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a
significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of
efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine
learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad
hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their
effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a
selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection.
Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage
self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction,
eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates
neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream
classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal
fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant
improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods,
exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong
generalization.

Method: 系统分析MCP系统安全状况，识别三类威胁，全面调研现有防御策略。

Result: 发现MCP安全攻击面从传统代码执行扩展到自然语言元数据语义解释。

Conclusion: 需要针对独特威胁模型的新型防御机制。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface
enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external
data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity
and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce
critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user
data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of
MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent
hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional
web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address
these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies,
examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered
detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry
systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous
oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security
fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from
traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language
metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat
model.

Result: 在五个模拟代理上实验，QueryIPI成功率达87%，优于基线，生成的恶意描述可迁移到真实系统。

Conclusion: QueryIPI凸显了现代基于大语言模型的编码代理存在实际安全风险。

Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and
system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect
Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors,
leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more
severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user
inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability:
leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a
constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first
query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool
descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked
internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI
achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated
malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a
practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.

Conclusion: PRO方法能有效解决现有开源大语言模型水印方法的问题，提升水印性能。

Abstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to
verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking
methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to
open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the
decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means
to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in
embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.
A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an
open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between
learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications
such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose
PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO
jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that
are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.
A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes
degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.
Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO
substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model
modifications.

Abstract: We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning
by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and
significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates
integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU
accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads
typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally
operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate
performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing
cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g.,
Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the
potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based
verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages
the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives
that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model
execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a
common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across
different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future
capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution
environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation
that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU
infrastructures.

analysis focuses on privacy concerns, data capture methods, data storage and
sharing practices, and proposed technical mitigations. To structure and
synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing
Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage
and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that
smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart
toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are
worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in
smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is
crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their
personal data more. Strategies to improve regulatory and technical safeguards
are also provided. The review identifies research gaps and suggests future
directions. The limitations of this literature review are also explained. The
findings have significant implications for policy development and the
transparency of data collection for smart devices.

*Bijeet Basak,Nupur Patil,Kurian Polachan,Srinivas Vivek*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文指出基于PUF保护二值神经网络（BNNs）方案易受PUF密钥恢复攻击，提出攻击方法并在MNIST数据集上评估，能高效恢复大部分密钥和模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rajendran等人提出的基于PUF保护BNNs的方案虽可抵御盗窃攻击，但可能存在安全漏洞，本文旨在验证其是否易受攻击。

Method: 受差分密码分析启发，通过观察模型准确率变化逐位重构PUF密钥，最终恢复BNN模型参数。

Result: 在MNIST数据集训练的BNN上，能恢复85%的PUF密钥，恢复的BNN模型分类准确率达93%，原模型为96%，且攻击效率高，只需几分钟。

Conclusion: Rajendran等人提出的保护BNNs的方案易受PUF密钥恢复攻击。

Abstract: Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) deployed on memristive crossbar arrays
provide energy-efficient solutions for edge computing but are susceptible to
physical attacks due to memristor nonvolatility. Recently, Rajendran et al.
(IEEE Embedded Systems Letter 2025) proposed a Physical Unclonable Function
(PUF)-based scheme to secure BNNs against theft attacks. Specifically, the
weight and bias matrices of the BNN layers were secured by swapping columns
based on device's PUF key bits.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this scheme to secure BNNs is vulnerable
to PUF-key recovery attack. As a consequence of our attack, we recover the
secret weight and bias matrices of the BNN. Our approach is motivated by
differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing
the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model
parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could
recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification
accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very
efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the
model parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出支持隐私保护机器学习推理的云原生同态加密工作流框架，优化后实现推理加速和内存利用降低，为安全MLaaS系统部署提供途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型通过云基础设施部署时，推理阶段用户数据保密是重大安全挑战，且同态加密在大规模云原生管道集成存在计算开销大、编排复杂和模型兼容性问题。

Method: 提出系统框架，将容器化HE模块与基于Kubernetes的编排集成，采用密文打包、多项式模调整和算子融合等优化策略。

Result: 与传统HE管道相比，所提系统实现高达3.2倍推理加速和40%内存利用率降低。

Conclusion: 为在零信任云条件下保证数据保密的安全MLaaS系统部署提供了实用途径。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud
infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a
significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a
compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,
allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.
However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines
remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,
and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of
cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving
ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules
with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel
encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,
optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus
adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource
consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference
acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional
HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying
secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality
under zero-trust cloud conditions.

methods over residual-adaptive frameworks.

Method: 提出SymMaP框架，用神经网络在高维离散空间搜索能准确预测最优参数的表达式。

Result: SymMaP在各种基准测试中始终优于传统策略。

Conclusion: SymMaP结合了传统方法和机器学习方法的优势，具有高推理效率和可解释性，部署简单可靠。

Abstract: Matrix preconditioning is a critical technique to accelerate the solution of
linear systems, where performance heavily depends on the selection of
preconditioning parameters. Traditional parameter selection approaches often
define fixed constants for specific scenarios. However, they rely on domain
expertise and fail to consider the instance-wise features for individual
problems, limiting their performance. In contrast, machine learning (ML)
approaches, though promising, are hindered by high inference costs and limited
interpretability. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we propose a
symbolic discovery framework-namely, Symbolic Matrix Preconditioning
(SymMaP)-to learn efficient symbolic expressions for preconditioning
parameters. Specifically, we employ a neural network to search the
high-dimensional discrete space for expressions that can accurately predict the
optimal parameters. The learned expression allows for high inference efficiency
and excellent interpretability (expressed in concise symbolic formulas), making
it simple and reliable for deployment. Experimental results show that SymMaP
consistently outperforms traditional strategies across various benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文介绍克服强施加边界条件局限的新方法，并与弱和半弱施加边界条件方法对比性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往强施加Neumann或Robin边界条件的方法有局限性，在分段$C^1$但全局$C^0$边界上会导致不稳定。

Method: 引入Sukumar & Srivastava方法的推广，以及基于正交投影的新方法。

Result: 将新方法与弱和半弱施加边界条件方法对比标量达西流方程和定常纳维 - 斯托克斯方程的性能。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但暗示新方法能克服之前方法的局限。

Abstract: Machine-learning based methods like physics-informed neural networks and
physics-informed neural operators are becoming increasingly adept at solving
even complex systems of partial differential equations. Boundary conditions can
be enforced either weakly by penalizing deviations in the loss function or
strongly by training a solution structure that inherently matches the
prescribed values and derivatives. The former approach is easy to implement but
the latter can provide benefits with respect to accuracy and training times.
However, previous approaches to strongly enforcing Neumann or Robin boundary
conditions require a domain with a fully $C^1$ boundary and, as we demonstrate,
can lead to instability if those boundary conditions are posed on a segment of
the boundary that is piecewise $C^1$ but only $C^0$ globally. We introduce a
generalization of the approach by Sukumar \& Srivastava (doi:
10.1016/j.cma.2021.114333), and a new approach based on orthogonal projections
that overcome this limitation. The performance of these new techniques is
compared against weakly and semi-weakly enforced boundary conditions for the
scalar Darcy flow equation and the stationary Navier-Stokes equations.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require highly efficient matrix multiplication
engines for complex computations. This paper presents a systolic array
architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements
(PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative
partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit
exact and approximate PE designs are employed in a 8x8 systolic array, which
achieves a energy savings of 22% and 32%, respectively, compared to the
existing design. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the proposed PEs are
integrated into a systolic array (SA) for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
computation, achieving high output quality with a PSNR of 38.21,dB.
Furthermore, in an edge detection application using convolution, the
approximate PE achieves a PSNR of 30.45,dB. These results highlight the
potential of the proposed design to deliver significant energy efficiency while
maintaining competitive output quality, making it well-suited for
error-resilient image and vision processing applications.

Motivation: 异构小芯片系统中NoI存在延迟问题，内存驱动传输会增加尾部延迟、违反SLA。

Method: 引入干扰分数IS量化最坏情况减速，将NoI综合问题转化为多目标优化问题，开发拓扑生成器PARL。

Result: PARL生成的拓扑减少了内存竞争，满足SLA，将最坏情况减速降至1.2倍，同时保持了与富链接网格相当的平均吞吐量。

Conclusion: 以工作负载感知目标重新构建了异构小芯片加速器的NoI设计。

Abstract: Heterogeneous chiplet-based systems improve scaling by disag-gregating
CPUs/GPUs and emerging technologies (HBM/DRAM).However this on-package
disaggregation introduces a latency inNetwork-on-Interposer(NoI). We observe
that in modern large-modelinference, parameters and activations routinely move
backand forth from HBM/DRAM, injecting large, bursty flows into theinterposer.
These memory-driven transfers inflate tail latency andviolate Service Level
Agreements (SLAs) across k-ary n-cube base-line NoI topologies. To address this
gap we introduce an InterferenceScore (IS) that quantifies worst-case slowdown
under contention.We then formulate NoI synthesis as a multi-objective
optimization(MOO) problem. We develop PARL (Partition-Aware
ReinforcementLearner), a topology generator that balances throughput,
latency,and power. PARL-generated topologies reduce contention at the memory
cut, meet SLAs, and cut worst-case slowdown to 1.2 times while maintaining
competitive mean throughput relative to link-rich meshes. Overall, this
reframes NoI design for heterogeneouschiplet accelerators with workload-aware
objectives.

Conclusion: 此工作连接了器件物理和函数逼近理论，为可扩展、节能的模拟机器学习系统指明方向。

Abstract: Achieving fully analog neural computation requires hardware that can natively
implement both linear and nonlinear operations with high efficiency. While
analogue matrix-vector multiplication has advanced via compute-in-memory
architectures, nonlinear activation functions remain a bottleneck, often
requiring digital or hybrid solutions. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold
framework, we propose KANalogue, a fully analogue implementation of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) using negative differential resistance
devices as physical realizations of learnable univariate basis functions. By
leveraging the intrinsic negative differential resistance characteristics of
tunnel diodes fabricated from NbSi2N4/HfSi2N4 heterostructures, we construct
coordinate-wise nonlinearities with distinct curvature and support profiles. We
extract I-V data from fabricated armchair and zigzag devices, fit high-order
polynomials to emulate diode behavior in software, and train KANs on vision
benchmarks using these learned basis functions. Our results demonstrate that
KANalogue can approximate complex functions with minimal parameters while
maintaining classification accuracy competitive with digital baselines. This
work bridges device-level physics and function approximation theory, charting a
path toward scalable, energy-efficient analogue machine learning systems.

Method: 引入基于Fisher信息的合作博弈特征函数，开发基于形式语法的NLP生成模型；训练图Transformer神经网络从观测数据中推断群体轨迹意图。

Result: 基于Fisher信息的特征函数能产生生成协调时空模式的概率分布，GTNN可高精度推断群体轨迹意图。

Conclusion: 所提出的公式和算法提供了一个跨越目标跟踪和群体意图推断的多层方法。

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

Result: 在WESAD上实现了较强的压力检测性能。

Conclusion: 特权EDA的表示可以转移到低成本传感器，提高准确性同时降低硬件成本。

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

Result: 仿真表明该方法收敛更快、飞行安全性更高、任务完成时间更短。

Conclusion: 该方法为未知环境下低空无线网络部署提供了强大有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

Motivation: 现有机器学习模型预测低血压忽略治疗升级的临床决策，预测儿茶酚胺启动能反映真实决策，更具临床可操作性。

Method: 使用MIMIC - III数据库，将儿茶酚胺启动建模为15分钟预测窗口内的二元事件，输入特征包括MAP统计描述符、人口统计信息等，用XGBoost模型训练并通过SHAP解释。

Conclusion: 基于MAP动态、治疗背景和患者特征预测儿茶酚胺启动支持治疗升级决策，未来应丰富相关信息并与现有系统对比。

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

Conclusion: LMT是首个具备上述特性的方法。

Abstract: We propose Local Momentum Tracking (LMT), a novel distributed stochastic
gradient method for solving distributed optimization problems over networks. To
reduce communication overhead, LMT enables each agent to perform multiple local
updates between consecutive communication rounds. Specifically, LMT integrates
local updates with the momentum tracking strategy and the Loopless Chebyshev
Acceleration (LCA) technique. We demonstrate that LMT achieves linear speedup
with respect to the number of local updates as well as the number of agents for
minimizing smooth objective functions. Moreover, with sufficiently many local
updates ($Q\geq Q^*$), LMT attains the optimal communication complexity. For a
moderate number of local updates ($Q\in[1,Q^*]$), it achieves the optimal
iteration complexity. To our knowledge, LMT is the first method that enjoys
such properties.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to model complex optimization
problems in many applications, yet have difficulty guaranteeing solution
optimality and feasibility, despite training on large datasets. Training a NN
as a surrogate optimization solver amounts to estimating a global solution
function that maps varying problem input parameters to the corresponding
optimal solutions. Work in multiparametric programming (mp) has shown that
solutions to quadratic programs (QP) are piece-wise linear functions of the
parameters, and researchers have suggested leveraging this property to model
mp-QP using NN with ReLU activation functions, which also exhibit piecewise
linear behaviour. This paper proposes a NN modeling approach and learning
algorithm that discovers the exact closed-form solution to QP with linear
constraints, by analytically deriving NN model parameters directly from the
problem coefficients without training. Whereas generic DNN cannot guarantee
accuracy outside the training distribution, the closed-form NN model produces
exact solutions for every discovered critical region of the solution function.
To evaluate the closed-form NN model, it was applied to DC optimal power flow
problems in electricity management. In terms of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
optimality and feasibility of solutions, it outperformed a classically trained
DNN and was competitive with, or outperformed, a commercial analytic solver
(Gurobi) at far less computational cost. For a long-range energy planning
problem, it was able to produce optimal and feasible solutions for millions of
input parameters within seconds.

Abstract: Decentralized bilevel optimization has garnered significant attention due to
its critical role in solving large-scale machine learning problems. However,
existing methods often rely on prior knowledge of problem parameters-such as
smoothness, convexity, or communication network topologies-to determine
appropriate stepsizes. In practice, these problem parameters are typically
unavailable, leading to substantial manual effort for hyperparameter tuning. In
this paper, we propose AdaSDBO, a fully problem-parameter-free algorithm for
decentralized bilevel optimization with a single-loop structure. AdaSDBO
leverages adaptive stepsizes based on cumulative gradient norms to update all
variables simultaneously, dynamically adjusting its progress and eliminating
the need for problem-specific hyperparameter tuning. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we establish that AdaSDBO achieves a convergence rate of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$, matching the performance of
well-tuned state-of-the-art methods up to polylogarithmic factors. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that AdaSDBO delivers competitive performance
compared to existing decentralized bilevel optimization methods while
exhibiting remarkable robustness across diverse stepsize configurations.

Conclusion: 提出的SFLCB算法有效，收敛率有改进，可实际应用。

Abstract: We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are
strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential
non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges
associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrangian
methods to reformulate the original problem as a single-level one. Especially,
we establish a strong theoretical connection between the reformulated function
and the original hyper-objective by characterizing the closeness of their
values and derivatives. Based on this reformulation, we propose a single-loop,
first-order algorithm for linearly constrained bilevel optimization (SFLCB). We
provide rigorous analyses of its non-asymptotic convergence rates, showing an
improvement over prior double-loop algorithms -- form
$O(\epsilon^{-3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. The experiments
corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficiency
of the proposed SFLCB algorithm. Simulation code is provided at

Motivation: 现有文献对GD映射非奇异性要么假设，要么有严格限制条件，本文旨在突破这些限制。

Conclusion: 显著扩展了GD和SGD收敛的现有结果，有望推动学习动力学进一步探索。

Abstract: The theory of training deep networks has become a central question of modern
machine learning and has inspired many practical advancements. In particular,
the gradient descent (GD) optimization algorithm has been extensively studied
in recent years. A key assumption about GD has appeared in several recent
works: the \emph{GD map is non-singular} -- it preserves sets of measure zero
under preimages. Crucially, this assumption has been used to prove that GD
avoids saddle points and maxima, and to establish the existence of a computable
quantity that determines the convergence to global minima (both for GD and
stochastic GD). However, the current literature either assumes the
non-singularity of the GD map or imposes restrictive assumptions, such as
Lipschitz smoothness of the loss (for example, Lipschitzness does not hold for
deep ReLU networks with the cross-entropy loss) and restricts the analysis to
GD with small step-sizes. In this paper, we investigate the neural network map
as a function on the space of weights and biases. We also prove, for the first
time, the non-singularity of the gradient descent (GD) map on the loss
landscape of realistic neural network architectures (with fully connected,
convolutional, or softmax attention layers) and piecewise analytic activations
(which includes sigmoid, ReLU, leaky ReLU, etc.) for almost all step-sizes. Our
work significantly extends the existing results on the convergence of GD and
SGD by guaranteeing that they apply to practical neural network settings and
has the potential to unlock further exploration of learning dynamics.

Method: 未提及具体方法。

Result: 证明了周期取三个不同实数值且密度至多为5/6的任务序列存在有效调度。

Conclusion: 猜想Chan和Chin的猜想对实周期也成立。

Abstract: For a sequence of tasks, each with a positive integer period, the pinwheel
scheduling problem involves finding a valid schedule in the sense that the
schedule performs one task per day and each task is performed at least once
every consecutive days of its period. It had been conjectured by Chan and Chin
in 1993 that there exists a valid schedule for any sequence of tasks with
density, the sum of the reciprocals of each period, at most $\frac{5}{6}$.
Recently, Kawamura settled this conjecture affirmatively. In this paper we
consider an extended version with real periods proposed by Kawamura, in which a
valid schedule must perform each task $i$ having a real period~$a_{i}$ at least
$l$ times in any consecutive $\lceil l a_{i} \rceil$ days for all positive
integer $l$. We show that any sequence of tasks such that the periods take
three distinct real values and the density is at most $\frac{5}{6}$ admits a
valid schedule. We hereby conjecture that the conjecture of Chan and Chin is
true also for real periods.

Conclusion: Grace系统能有效解决大视觉语言模型在实时对地观测L波段遥感影像解译中的应用问题，降低推理延迟。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated great
potential in remote sensing (RS) tasks (e.g., disaster monitoring) conducted by
low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. However, their deployment in real-world LEO
satellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard
computing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a
satellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference
in RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime
inference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end
performance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous
satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch
algorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite
archive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground
data exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that
either processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS.
Extensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that
Grace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art
methods, without compromising inference accuracy.

Abstract: This study proves that Nearest Neighbor (NN) matching can be interpreted as
an instance of Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning. Lin et
al. (2023) shows that NN matching is an instance of density-ratio estimation
with their new density-ratio estimator. Chernozhukov et al. (2024) develops
Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, which directly
estimates the Riesz representer (or equivalently, the bias-correction term) by
minimizing the mean squared error. In this study, we first prove that the
density-ratio estimation method proposed in Lin et al. (2023) is essentially
equivalent to Least-Squares Importance Fitting (LSIF) proposed in Kanamori et
al. (2009) for direct density-ratio estimation. Furthermore, we derive Riesz
regression using the LSIF framework. Based on these results, we derive NN
matching from Riesz regression. This study is based on our work Kato (2025a)

Abstract: Understanding and forecasting precipitation events in the Arctic maritime
environments, such as Bear Island and Ny-{\AA}lesund, is crucial for assessing
climate risk and developing early warning systems in vulnerable marine regions.
This study proposes a probabilistic machine learning framework for modeling and
predicting the dynamics and severity of precipitation. We begin by analyzing
the scale-dependent relationships between precipitation and key atmospheric
drivers (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover, and air pressure)
using wavelet coherence, which captures localized dependencies across time and
frequency domains. To assess joint causal influences, we employ
Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition, which quantifies the impact of
interaction effects among each variable on future precipitation dynamics. These
insights inform the development of data-driven forecasting models that
incorporate both historical precipitation and causal climate drivers. To
account for uncertainty, we employ the conformal prediction method, which
enables the generation of calibrated non-parametric prediction intervals. Our
results underscore the importance of utilizing a comprehensive framework that
combines causal analysis with probabilistic forecasting to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of precipitation predictions in Arctic marine
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法对复杂机器人策略有效，具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detecting automated accounts (bots) among genuine users on platforms like
Twitter remains a challenging task due to the evolving behaviors and adaptive
strategies of such accounts. While recent methods have achieved strong
detection performance by combining text, metadata, and user relationship
information within graph-based frameworks, many of these models heavily depend
on explicit user-user relationship data. This reliance limits their
applicability in scenarios where such information is unavailable. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates
detailed textual features with enriched user metadata while employing
graph-based reasoning without requiring follower-following data. Our method
uses transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) to extract deep semantic embeddings
from tweets, which are aggregated using max pooling to form comprehensive
user-level representations. These are further combined with auxiliary
behavioral features and passed through a GraphSAGE model to capture both local
and global patterns in user behavior. Experimental results on the Cresci-15,
Cresci-17, and PAN 2019 datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach,
achieving accuracies of 99.8%, 99.1%, and 96.8%, respectively, and highlighting
its effectiveness against increasingly sophisticated bot strategies.

Abstract: As a window for urban sensing, human mobility contains rich spatiotemporal
information that reflects both residents' behavior preferences and the
functions of urban areas. The analysis of human mobility has attracted the
attention of many researchers. However, existing methods often address specific
tasks from a particular perspective, leading to insufficient modeling of human
mobility and limited applicability of the learned knowledge in various
downstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to
push massive amounts of human mobility data into a spatiotemporal model,
discover latent semantics behind mobility behavior and support various urban
sensing tasks. Specifically, a large-scale and widely covering human mobility
data is collected through the ubiquitous base station system and a framework
named General-purpose and Dynamic Human Mobility Embedding (GDHME) for urban
sensing is introduced. The framework follows the self-supervised learning idea
and contains two major stages. In stage 1, GDHME treats people and regions as
nodes within a dynamic graph, unifying human mobility data as
people-region-time interactions. An encoder operating in continuous-time
dynamically computes evolving node representations, capturing dynamic states
for both people and regions. Moreover, an autoregressive self-supervised task
is specially designed to guide the learning of the general-purpose node
embeddings. In stage 2, these representations are utilized to support various
tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our GDHME framework, we further
construct a multi-task urban sensing benchmark. Offline experiments demonstrate
GDHME's ability to automatically learn valuable node features from vast amounts
of data. Furthermore, our framework is used to deploy the JiuTian ChuanLiu Big
Model, a system that has been presented at the 2023 China Mobile Worldwide
Partner Conference.

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) by integrating
external knowledge, such as user-specific phrases or entities, during decoding.
In this work, we use an attention-based biasing decoder to produce scores for
candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an ASR encoder,
which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for
shallow-fusion biasing. We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that
encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing
distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our
method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and
significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions
when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing. Our approach is modular and
can be used with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially
boost performance of other biasing methods.

Abstract: The 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires in Australia devastated 19 million
hectares, destroyed 3,000 homes, and lasted seven months, demonstrating the
escalating scale and urgency of wildfire threats requiring better forecasting
for effective response. Traditional fire modeling relies on manual
interpretation by Fire Behaviour Analysts (FBAns) and static environmental
data, often leading to inaccuracies and operational limitations. Emerging data
sources, such as NASA's FIRMS satellite imagery and Volunteered Geographic
Information, offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread
prediction. This study proposes a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework
(MFiSP) that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to
enhance forecast accuracy. By adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between
assimilation cycles, the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior
predictions to align with the observed rate of spread. We evaluate the efficacy
of MFiSP using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple
scenarios, analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters.
Results suggest that our MFiSP integrating multimodal data can improve fire
spread prediction beyond conventional methods reliant on FBAn expertise and
static inputs.

Conclusion: 双行动减法集结果有理论支撑，更大减法集猜想待进一步验证。

Abstract: Subtraction games have a rich literature as normal-play combinatorial games
(e.g., Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy, 1982). Recently, the theory has been
extended to zero-sum scoring play (Cohensius et al. 2019). Here, we take the
approach of cumulative self-interest games, as introduced in a recent framework
preprint by Larsson, Meir, and Zick. By adapting standard Pure Subgame Perfect
Equilibria (PSPE) from classical game theory, players must declare and commit
to acting either ``friendly'' or ``antagonistic'' in case of indifference.
Whenever the subtraction set has size two, we establish a tie-breaking rule
monotonicity: a friendly player can never benefit by a deterministic deviation
to antagonistic play. This type of terminology is new to both ``economic'' and
``combinatorial'' games, but it becomes essential in the self-interest
cumulative setting. The main result is an immediate consequence of the
tie-breaking rule's monotonicity; in the case of two-action subtraction sets,
two antagonistic players are never better off than two friendly players, i.e.,
their PSPE utilities are never greater. For larger subtraction sets, we
conjecture that the main result continues to hold, while tie-breaking
monotonicity may fail, and we provide empirical evidence in support of both
statements.

Result: 在Yelp、Goodreads和Amazon数据集上，PerFine比PGraphRAG持续提升个性化效果，GEval提升7 - 13%，迭代3 - 5次有稳定提升，且随批评者模型增大有可扩展性。

Conclusion: 事后、感知用户画像的反馈为个性化大语言模型生成提供了强大范式，且无训练、与模型无关。

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

Result: R3使RAG性能比原检索器提高5.2%，超现有最优检索器4.9%，与基于大语言模型的检索和RAG系统效果相当。

Conclusion: R3高效实用，仅需4个GPU且一天内完成训练。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

Method: 引入ComboBench基准，对来自4款流行VR游戏的262个场景进行评估，对比7个大语言模型与标注的真实情况和人类表现。

Result: 顶级模型有较强任务分解能力，但在程序推理和空间理解上不如人类，性能因游戏而异，少样本示例可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在VR操作能力上有提升空间，可通过少样本示例进行针对性增强。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples
substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted
enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities. We release all materials at

Result: 强调了经验权衡、选择标准和最佳实践。

Conclusion: 为数据和资源有限时有效微调大语言模型的研究者和从业者提供可行见解。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with limited data poses a practical
challenge in low-resource languages, specialized domains, and constrained
deployment settings. While pre-trained LLMs provide strong foundations,
effective adaptation under data scarcity requires focused and efficient
fine-tuning techniques. This paper presents a structured and practical survey
of recent methods for fine-tuning LLMs in data-scarce scenarios. We
systematically review parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques that lower
training and deployment costs, domain and cross-lingual adaptation methods for
both encoder and decoder models, and model specialization strategies. We
further examine preference alignment approaches that guide model behavior using
limited human or synthetic feedback, emphasizing sample and compute efficiency.
Throughout, we highlight empirical trade-offs, selection criteria, and best
practices for choosing suitable techniques based on task constraints, including
model scaling, data scaling, and the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. The
aim is to equip researchers and practitioners with actionable insights for
effectively fine-tuning LLMs when data and resources are limited.

Motivation: 语言模型检测心理健康危机情况是关键但未充分探索的挑战，检测失败后果严重。

Method: 引入CRADLE BENCH基准，涵盖七种临床标准定义的危机类型和时间标签，用多语言模型多数投票集成自动标注约4K训练样本，在不同一致标准子集上微调六个危机检测模型。

Result: 多数投票集成标注显著优于单模型标注。

Conclusion: 提供了多面危机检测基准和不同一致标准下训练的互补模型。

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

Conclusion: Combo - Eval是评估大语言模型生成的NLR的有效方法，具有较好的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

Result: OraPlan - SQL排名第一，英文执行准确率55.0%，中文56.7%，SQL有效性超99%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效提升了系统在NL2SQL任务中的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

Conclusion: 该方法有效，能节省计算资源，研究揭示了大语言模型对声明匹配的理解。

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Method: 从人工提示种子开始，逐步优化指令以满足目录特定要求，自动生成和细化提示评估属性质量。

Result: 自动提示级联比传统思维链提示提高8 - 10%的准确率和召回率，将每个属性的领域专家工作量从5.1小时减少到3分钟，跨五种语言和多任务表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，可推广到不同语言和任务，显著提升效率。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

Motivation: 以往研究对多语言大模型去学习的分析重性能，存在评估盲点，即全微调后去学习时出现语言混淆问题，标准指标失效。

Method: 分三步解决：引入N - Mix分数量化语言混淆；证明高N - Mix分数时基于参考的指标会产生假阴性；建议使用能直接评估生成句子内容的语义指标。

Result: 表明语言混淆在多语言大模型中普遍且一致，基于参考的指标在高N - Mix分数时不可靠。

Conclusion: 需要新的去学习评估指标，即语义指标。

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

Motivation: 现有缓解大语言模型幻觉的方法依赖粗粒度信号引导模型弃权，导致对模型自身知识边界感知不精确，需要改进。

Method: 提出细粒度语义置信奖励的强化学习框架，通过对多个候选答案采样和语义聚类，训练模型保留高置信度簇答案、丢弃低置信度簇答案；提出新的评估指标。

Result: 方法在领域内和分布外基准测试中显著提升了可靠性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升大语言模型弃权的可靠性，且新评估指标更全面。

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KD方法对所有token统一应用蒸馏损失，会引入噪声，损害学生模型性能。

Method: 提出SpecKD框架，引入动态的token级门控机制，根据教师分布验证学生的token提议，仅对“接受”的token应用蒸馏损失。

Result: 在多种文本生成任务的大量实验中，SpecKD始终显著优于强大的KD基线，训练更稳定，学生模型能力更强，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SpecKD是一种有效的知识蒸馏方法，能提升学生模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

Result: 大语言模型易受输入扰动影响，对研究较少的群体更易出现偏见行为。

Conclusion: 有必要将公平性和安全性研究扩展到更多样化的群体。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

Method: 提出模式感知行级去重（PLD）和模式感知尾标点过滤（PTF）方法，既考虑行级信号，也考虑其在文档中的顺序分布。

Result: 在英语和韩语小语言模型训练评估中，方法能提升多项选择基准性能，显著提高SQuAD v1和KorQuAD v1的生成式问答准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效改善相关性能。

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level
deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic
methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

for logical consistency and answerability. Evaluations of four large language
models -- two multilingual and two Korean-specialized -- show that multilingual
models outperform Korean-focused ones even in Korean reasoning tasks,
indicating cross-lingual generalization of reasoning ability. Carefully
designed prompting strategies, which combine few-shot examples, reasoning
traces, and task-specific hints, further boost accuracy, approaching
human-level performance. Ko-MuSR offers a solid foundation for advancing Korean

Method: 创建MuSaG数据集，标注文本、音频和视频模态，对九种开源和商业模型进行基准测试并与人类标注对比。

Result: 人类在对话场景中严重依赖音频，模型在文本上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 当前多模态模型存在差距，MuSaG可用于开发更适合现实场景的模型，公开MuSaG支持后续研究。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

Conclusion: 语义对齐是大语言模型跨尺度知识转移的基本前提，该方法简单且优于先前工作，能更好地对齐不同规模模型的行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

TL;DR: 提出无强监督的在线RL方法Critique - RL训练评估语言模型，采用两阶段优化策略，实验显示有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估语言模型训练方法依赖强监督标注评估数据，需改进。

Method: 提出Critique - RL，采用两玩家范式，两阶段优化策略，第一阶段用基于规则的直接奖励信号强化评估器的判别能力，第二阶段引入基于行动者改进的间接奖励提高评估器的有用性并正则化保持判别能力。

Result: 在不同任务和模型上实验，如Qwen2.5 - 7B在域内任务提升9.02%，域外任务提升5.70%。

Conclusion: Critique - RL能显著提升性能，有应用潜力。

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

Motivation: 深入理解Transformer模型中记忆的表示，并探索有效去除记忆的方法，同时研究其对下游任务的影响。

Method: 基于损失景观曲率对模型权重进行分解，提出权重编辑程序，分析编辑操作对下游任务的影响。

Result: 权重编辑程序比现有方法更有效抑制未目标记忆数据的背诵，保持较低困惑度；对事实检索和算术任务有负面影响，对开卷事实检索和一般逻辑推理无影响。

Conclusion: 工作增强了对神经网络记忆的理解及去除记忆的应用，证明数学和事实检索等任务涉及特殊、窄用的结构。

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在文化相关和方言内容上跨语言表现不均，需提升其在阿拉伯语文化和方言方面的性能。

Method: 将现代标准阿拉伯语选择题翻译为英语和多种阿拉伯方言，转换为开放式问题，对零样本和微调大语言模型进行基准测试，生成思维链理由微调模型。

Result: 模型在阿拉伯方言表现不佳；阿拉伯中心模型选择题表现好但开放式问题有困难；思维链提高判断正确性，n - 元语法指标有差异。

Conclusion: 开发的数据集将公开，以支持文化和语言包容性评估的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型长文本生成评估中难以兼顾现实性和可验证性的问题。

Method: 引入LongWeave，使用CoV - Eval方法，先在现实场景中定义可验证目标，再系统生成对应查询、文本材料和约束。

Result: 对23个大语言模型的评估显示，随着现实复杂度和输出长度增加，即使是最先进的模型在长文本生成方面也面临重大挑战。

Conclusion: LongWeave可对模型满足复杂现实约束的能力进行严格评估，长文本生成对大语言模型仍是难题。

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

Motivation: 大型语言模型用于伊斯兰指导存在引用错误、法理学应用不当等风险，需评估其在该领域的表现。

Method: 采用双代理框架，定量代理进行引用验证和六维评分，定性代理进行五维并排比较。

Result: GPT - 4o在伊斯兰准确性和引用方面得分最高，Ansari AI定性比较获胜多，Fanar虽落后但有创新。

Conclusion: 强调需要以穆斯林视角为中心的社区驱动基准，推动高风险领域更可靠AI发展。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk
misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally
inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar
on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes
domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

Conclusion: 通过分析和框架构建，为缓解大语言模型幻觉问题提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of
large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among
various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to
balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and
underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been
systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective
of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their
integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy
distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically
examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework
supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

Motivation: 大语言模型融入生活，但存在社会偏差且常为隐式，需开发评估其隐式知识表征的方法。

Method: 提出基于模拟语义启动的词关联网络方法，通过基于提示的方式评估偏差，可对比模型与人类。

Result: 揭示了大语言模型和人类偏差的异同，为使用模型的潜在风险提供新视角。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建评估和比较多模型与人类偏差的框架，推动透明和社会责任语言技术的目标。

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

TL;DR: 研究三种基于前缀方法用于从英语到35+种高低资源语言的零样本跨语言迁移，发现前缀方法在多个基准测试中优于LoRA，凸显其在低资源多语言场景的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然新大语言模型使零样本跨语言迁移可行，但将仅解码器的大语言模型适应新的跨语言任务仍具挑战，基于前缀的技术在仅解码器模型的零样本迁移中探索较少。

Method: 对三种基于前缀的方法进行全面研究，探索跨语系和文字的迁移，以及不同模型规模的影响。

Result: 使用Llama 3.1 8B和Mistral v0.3 7B时，前缀方法在Belebele基准测试中比LoRA基线最多高6%，前缀调优仅用123万个学习参数就在多个基准测试中取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 基于前缀的技术是LoRA的有效且可扩展的替代方案，尤其适用于低资源多语言场景。

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 提出基于主动上下文管理的AgentFold代理范式，在多个基准测试中表现出色，超越多种大模型和专有代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的Web代理在长周期任务中因上下文管理的权衡问题影响效果，ReAct代理存在上下文饱和问题，固定总结历史的方法会损失关键细节。

Method: 引入AgentFold范式，将上下文视为动态认知工作区，在每一步学习执行“折叠”操作，多尺度管理历史轨迹。

Result: AgentFold - 30B - A3B代理在BrowseComp和BrowseComp - ZH上分别达到36.2%和47.3%的成绩，超越多种大模型和专有代理。

Conclusion: AgentFold范式通过主动上下文管理，在长周期任务的信息检索中具有有效性和优越性。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

Result: 评估17个模型，最佳模型准确率仅13.73%，强制交互有显著提升，交互能力15个月停滞。

Conclusion: InteractComp是评估和训练搜索智能体交互能力的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The
code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.

Motivation: 当前基于提示的角色扮演（PBRP）在医疗决策支持系统中应用广泛，但角色提示对模型推理能力的影响尚不明确，因此开展研究。

Method: 引入RP - Neuron - Activated Evaluation Framework (RPNA)，在三个医疗问答数据集上进行测试，采用神经元消融和表征分析技术评估推理路径的变化。

Result: 角色提示未显著增强大语言模型的医疗推理能力，主要影响表面语言特征，各临床角色间无明显推理路径或认知差异。

Conclusion: 当前PBRP方法无法复制现实医疗实践中的认知复杂性，强调需要能模拟真实认知过程而非仅语言模仿的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练方法如GRPO丢弃实体信息，无法区分“接近正确”样本和完全失败样本，浪费学习信号。

Method: 通过实证分析发现推理过程中识别的真实实体数量与最终答案准确性有强正相关，引入E - GRPO框架，制定密集的实体感知奖励函数。

Result: 在不同问答和深度研究基准测试中，E - GRPO持续且显著优于GRPO基线，还能诱导更高效推理策略，减少工具调用。

Conclusion: E - GRPO是一种更有效且样本效率更高的搜索代理对齐方法。

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse
question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO
consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also
induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls,
demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search
agents.

TL;DR: 提出 ParallelMuse 两阶段范式解决传统并行思维在深度信息检索代理中的问题，实验显示性能提升且减少探索令牌消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行思维用于深度信息检索代理时存在反复从头展开效率低、长时推理轨迹难整合的问题，需解决以提升问题解决能力。

Method: 提出两阶段范式 ParallelMuse，第一阶段进行功能指定部分展开，第二阶段进行压缩推理聚合。

Result: 在多个开源代理和基准测试中，性能提升达 62%，探索令牌消耗减少 10 - 30%。

Conclusion: ParallelMuse 范式能有效解决传统并行思维的问题，提升深度信息检索代理的性能。

Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep
exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance
problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two
key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from
scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories
during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full
consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose
ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first
stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences
into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and
branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed
Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress
information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final
answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks
demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in

Motivation: 大规模监督微调代理训练数据收集有挑战，数据碎片化是瓶颈。

Method: 引入ADP作为不同格式数据集和统一训练管道的中间语言，将13个现有数据集统一为ADP格式。

Result: 标准化ADP数据转换后SFT比基础模型平均提升约20%性能，在多个基准测试达SOTA或接近SOTA水平。

Conclusion: ADP有助于降低标准化、可扩展和可复现的代理训练门槛。

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to
standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Conclusion: 新算法在求解逆源问题相关算子计算上有较好表现，代码公开利于进一步研究。

Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several
other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms.
Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In
addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to
further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple
applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint.
In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical
evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular
acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these
operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We
demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where
they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction
techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and
total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods,
such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and
computational examples is available to the general public.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于分类器或无分类器引导，本文提出新框架以更好实现视频到音频生成。

Method: 引入模型引导双角色对齐原则，框架包含可扩展流基Transformer模型、双角色对齐机制和模型引导目标。

Result: 在VGGSound上达SOTA，FAD降至0.40，超越无分类器引导基线，在多个指标上表现好，在UnAV - 100基准上泛化性好。

Conclusion: 模型引导双角色对齐是条件视频到音频生成的强大且可扩展范式。

Abstract: We present MGAudio, a novel flow-based framework for open-domain
video-to-audio generation, which introduces model-guided dual-role alignment as
a central design principle. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
classifier-based or classifier-free guidance, MGAudio enables the generative
model to guide itself through a dedicated training objective designed for
video-conditioned audio generation. The framework integrates three main
components: (1) a scalable flow-based Transformer model, (2) a dual-role
alignment mechanism where the audio-visual encoder serves both as a
conditioning module and as a feature aligner to improve generation quality, and
(3) a model-guided objective that enhances cross-modal coherence and audio
realism. MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing
FAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance
baselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and
alignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100
benchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a
powerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation. Code

Method: 提出帧在线神经融合框架，通过神经网络估计多个无失真差分波束形成器的组合权重。

Result: 与传统自适应凸组合算法相比，更能有效适应动态声学环境。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持无失真约束的同时，实现更强的干扰抑制。

Abstract: Fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the
estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance.
However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which
limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive
convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of
multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness.
Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as
rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track
rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural
fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which
estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with
conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic
acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while
maintaining the distortionless constraint.

Result: TMFWC技术结合储层计算方法显著提升了音频信号处理的效率。

Conclusion: 所提方法能减少时频转换计算负担和小波提取复杂度，有效提升音频信号处理效率。

Abstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech
signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most
widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition
applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering
taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it
provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the
information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet
transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency
information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of
non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform
frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in
analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies,
and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to
develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet
transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features.
The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods
require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of
Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are
proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the
concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of
time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining
our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique
with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the
efficiency of audio signal processing.

Abstract: Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and
evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions
is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions
are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable.
Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass,
but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution
magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive.
We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic
fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying
the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results
demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression
stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better
than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal
component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically
meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised
segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or
fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数计算BVC模型局限于二维环境，在环境存在水平对称时易产生空间歧义。

Method: 在BVC框架中引入垂直角度敏感性，处理LiDAR数据捕捉垂直轮廓。

Result: 在垂直变化小的环境中，3D模型与2D基线性能相当；随3D复杂度增加，产生更多不同位置场，显著减少空间混叠。

Conclusion: 为基于BVC的定位增加垂直维度可显著增强现实3D空间导航和映射，同时在简单近平面场景保持性能一致。

Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of
vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and
allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the
hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional
(2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of
horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we
incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby
enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to
significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired
robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby
disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D
representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal
vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D
baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more
distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings
show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can
significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while
retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

Conclusion: SynAD架起合成场景生成与端到端自动驾驶桥梁，为更全面强大的自动驾驶模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality
real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving.
Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of
driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a
promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its
application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily
due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor
inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance
real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent
with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a
multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto
maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view
features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training
strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real
driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively
integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging
synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more
comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.

Abstract: Navigating to a designated goal using visual information is a fundamental
capability for intelligent robots. Most classical visual navigation methods are
restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To
address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and
multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that
leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo
constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system
queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local
perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals
during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a
high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal
open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that
LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal
localization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
multi-goal visual navigation. Project page:

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning
sequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained
prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where
achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of
tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates
a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the
task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is
compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that
cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its
fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg
insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from
the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical
analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with
$\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to
the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and
practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with
fewer demonstrated tasks. Project page with videos and code:

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge
due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent
approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised
representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms
such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or
scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize
2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and
dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present
DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and
dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future
prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on
multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future
dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned
representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic
manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two
challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic
experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,
generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability
across diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into
serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses
greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based
virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost
efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a
Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for
generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are
characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain
relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the
proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate
realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators
(KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated
scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with
several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on
scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity
profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios
for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent
interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative
improvement.

Result: 提出新的容错循环构造，可用于验证分布式算法。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于使用会话类型验证分布式算法，提升效率。

Abstract: Multiparty session types are designed to abstractly capture the structure of
communication protocols and verify behavioural properties. One important such
property is progress, i.e., the absence of deadlock. Distributed algorithms
often resemble multiparty communication protocols. But proving their
properties, in particular termination that is closely related to progress, can
be elaborate. Since distributed algorithms are often designed to cope with
faults, a first step towards using session types to verify distributed
algorithms is to integrate fault-tolerance.
  We extend FTMPST (a version of fault-tolerant multiparty session types with
failure patterns to represent system requirements for system failures such as
unreliable communication and process crashes) by a novel, fault-tolerant loop
construct with global escapes that does not require global coordination. Each
process runs its own local version of the loop. If a process finds a solution
to the considered problem, it does not only terminate its own loop but also
informs the other participants via exit-messages. Upon receiving an
exit-message, a process immediately terminates its algorithm. To increase
efficiency and model standard fault-tolerant algorithms, these messages are
non-blocking, i.e., a process may continue until a possibly delayed
exit-message is received. To illustrate our approach, we analyse a variant of
the well-known rotating coordinator algorithm by Chandra and Toueg.

Result: 在真实标普500期权数据上，深度学习方法在多误差指标上优于传统校准技术，收敛更快，样本内外泛化性更好。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时金融模型校准提供实用且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: The Heston stochastic volatility model is a widely used tool in financial
mathematics for pricing European options. However, its calibration remains
computationally intensive and sensitive to local minima due to the model's
nonlinear structure and high-dimensional parameter space. This paper introduces
a hybrid deep learning-based framework that enhances both the computational
efficiency and the accuracy of the calibration procedure. The proposed approach
integrates two supervised feedforward neural networks: the Price Approximator
Network (PAN), which approximates the option price surface based on strike and
moneyness inputs, and the Calibration Correction Network (CCN), which refines
the Heston model's output by correcting systematic pricing errors. Experimental
results on real S\&P 500 option data demonstrate that the deep learning
approach outperforms traditional calibration techniques across multiple error
metrics, achieving faster convergence and superior generalization in both
in-sample and out-of-sample settings. This framework offers a practical and
robust solution for real-time financial model calibration.

### [301] [Unsupervised Machine-Learning Pipeline for Data-Driven Defect Detection and Characterisation: Application to Displacement Cascades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24523)
*Samuel Del Fré,Andrée de Backer,Christophe Domain,Ludovic Thuinet,Charlotte S. Becquart*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 提出无监督机器学习工作流检测和分类材料辐照缺陷，应用于多种材料，效果良好，为材料结构异常定量映射提供工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子辐照产生的缺陷影响材料长期演化，需有效方法检测和分类这些缺陷。

Method: 用Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)向量编码局部环境，用自编码器神经网络（AE）分离异常原子，用Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)嵌入，用Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)聚类。

Result: AE成功识别参与缺陷形成的少量异常原子，HDBSCAN将AE标记的SOAP描述符的UMAP潜在空间划分为不同组，99.7%的异常原子被分配到紧凑物理图案，聚类大小与净缺陷计数有强相关性，与传统探测器有强重叠和互补覆盖。

Conclusion: 该机器学习工作流为材料结构异常定量映射提供了高效工具，尤其适用于位移级联中的辐照损伤。

Abstract: Neutron irradiation produces, within a few picoseconds, displacement cascades
that are sequences of atomic collisions generating point and extended defects
which subsequently affects the long-term evolution of materials. The diversity
of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what
is called the "primary damage". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised
machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects
directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the
Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated
with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied
to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe$_7$0Ni$_{10}$Cr$_{20}$, and Zr, the
AE successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate
in defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of
AE-flagged SOAP descriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and
interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large
aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed
cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales
with net defect counts (R2 > 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML
outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation
extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all
achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides
an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in
materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement
cascades.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建能连接两个模拟器的场级模拟器。

Method: 利用基于流的方法学习从一个模拟器到另一个的似然传输，采用条件最优传输流匹配（COT - FM）确保数据转换失真最小。

Result: 在连接弱引力透镜模拟器（从LPT到N - body PM）中，模拟器能捕捉两个模拟器间的完整修正，实现全场推理准确恢复真实后验。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，准确性超越传统统计摘要。

Abstract: We propose a new field-level emulator that bridges two simulators using
unpaired simulation datasets. Our method leverages a flow-based approach to
learn the likelihood transport from one simulator to the other. Since multiple
transport maps exist, we employ Conditional Optimal Transport Flow Matching
(COT-FM) to ensure that the transformation minimally distorts the underlying
structure of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by
bridging weak lensing simulators: a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) to a
N-body Particle-Mesh (PM). We demonstrate that our emulator captures the full
correction between the simulators by showing that it enables full-field
inference to accurately recover the true posterior, validating its accuracy
beyond traditional summary statistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测AI如何重塑工作需要理解其实际应用情况，本研究旨在探究哪些内在任务特征驱动用户将工作委托给AI系统。

Method: 利用包含四百万次Claude AI交互的数据集，对每个任务在七个关键维度进行评分，采用多元技术识别潜在任务原型并分析其与AI使用的关系。

Result: 高创造力、复杂性和认知需求但低常规性的任务吸引最多AI参与；确定三种任务原型；AI使用模式高度集中，5%的任务占所有交互的59%。

Conclusion: 研究提供了将现实世界生成式AI使用与内在任务特征的综合多维框架联系起来的首个系统证据，引入数据驱动的工作原型分类，为分析新兴的人机分工提供新框架。

Abstract: Purpose: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems like
ChatGPT, Claude AI, etc., has a deep impact on how work is done. Predicting how
AI will reshape work requires understanding not just its capabilities, but how
it is actually being adopted. This study investigates which intrinsic task
characteristics drive users' decisions to delegate work to AI systems.
Methodology: This study utilizes the Anthropic Economic Index dataset of four
million Claude AI interactions mapped to O*NET tasks. We systematically scored
each task across seven key dimensions: Routine, Cognitive, Social Intelligence,
Creativity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, and Decision Making using 35
parameters. We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task
archetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks
requiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low
routineness, attracted the most AI engagement. Furthermore, we identified three
task archetypes: Dynamic Problem Solving, Procedural & Analytical Work, and
Standardized Operational Tasks, demonstrating that AI applicability is best
predicted by a combination of task characteristics, over individual factors.
Our analysis revealed highly concentrated AI usage patterns, with just 5% of
tasks accounting for 59% of all interactions. Originality: This research
provides the first systematic evidence linking real-world generative AI usage
to a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of intrinsic task
characteristics. It introduces a data-driven classification of work archetypes
that offers a new framework for analyzing the emerging human-AI division of
labor.

Method: 采用双向固定效应面板模型进行研究。

Result: 环境信息披露显著改善企业环境绩效，在人口密度高、绿地少的地区效果更明显。

Conclusion: 环境信息披露是改善企业环境实践的关键工具，应制定针对性的区域政策以提高披露效果，促进可持续发展。

Abstract: Global climate warming and air pollution pose severe threats to economic
development and public safety, presenting significant challenges to sustainable
development worldwide. Corporations, as key players in resource utilization and
emissions, have drawn increasing attention from policymakers, researchers, and
the public regarding their environmental strategies and practices. This study
employs a two-way fixed effects panel model to examine the impact of
environmental information disclosure on corporate environmental performance,
its regional heterogeneity, and the underlying mechanisms. The results
demonstrate that environmental information disclosure significantly improves
corporate environmental performance, with the effect being more pronounced in
areas of high population density and limited green space. These findings
provide empirical evidence supporting the role of environmental information
disclosure as a critical tool for improving corporate environmental practices.
The study highlights the importance of targeted, region-specific policies to
maximize the effectiveness of disclosure, offering valuable insights for
promoting sustainable development through enhanced corporate transparency.

Motivation: 宏观经济不确定性上升，能源与食品市场风险关联复杂，挑战全球能源和食品保障。

Method: 结合 GJRSK 模型、时频连通性分析和随机森林方法。

Result: 有显著多维风险溢出，不同矩和时间尺度的连通性特征不同，原油是核心传导者，溢出效应受多因素影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为能源和食品市场协同治理、多层风险预警系统改进和投资策略优化提供有价值见解。

Abstract: With escalating macroeconomic uncertainty, the risk interlinkages between
energy and food markets have become increasingly complex, posing serious
challenges to global energy and food security. This paper proposes an
integrated framework combining the GJRSK model, the time-frequency
connectedness analysis, and the random forest method to systematically
investigate the moment connectedness within the energy-food nexus and explore
the key drivers of various spillover effects. The results reveal significant
multidimensional risk spillovers with pronounced time variation, heterogeneity,
and crisis sensitivity. Return and skewness connectedness are primarily driven
by short-term spillovers, kurtosis connectedness is more prominent over the
medium term, while volatility connectedness is dominated by long-term dynamics.
Notably, crude oil consistently serves as a central transmitter in diverse
connectedness networks. Furthermore, the spillover effects are influenced by
multiple factors, including macro-financial conditions, oil supply-demand
fundamentals, policy uncertainties, and climate-related shocks, with the core
drivers of connectedness varying considerably across different moments and
timescales. These findings provide valuable insights for the coordinated
governance of energy and food markets, the improvement of multilayered risk
early-warning systems, and the optimization of investment strategies.

Motivation: 多数研究用重复截面数据无法识别移民辩论中的关键问题效应，需新方法解决。

Method: 提供统一实证框架，将移民区域效应分解为潜在组成部分，利用跟踪工人随时间变化的数据进行分析。

Result: 通过实证应用，这种分析能更全面反映移民对工资、就业和职业晋升的影响。

Conclusion: 所提出的分析框架比传统使用重复截面数据的研究更能提供移民影响的有效信息。

Abstract: Most studies on the labor market effects of immigration use repeated
cross-sectional data to estimate the effects of immigration on regions. This
paper shows that such regional effects are composites of effects that address
fundamental questions in the immigration debate but remain unidentified with
repeated cross-sectional data. We provide a unifying empirical framework that
decomposes the regional effects of immigration into their underlying components
and show how these are identifiable from data that track workers over time. Our
empirical application illustrates that such analysis yields a far more
informative picture of immigration's effects on wages, employment, and
occupational upgrading.

Result: 发现现任政府及其支持选民处于有两个纳什均衡的博弈中，政府会有意改变经济因素维持地位。

Conclusion: 通过经济模型分析可帮助理解选举参与受经济等多因素影响。

Abstract: This article investigates the fundamental factors influencing the rate and
manner of Electoral participation with an economic model-based approach. In
this study, the structural parameters affecting people's decision making are
divided into two categories. The first category includes general topics such as
economic and livelihood status, cultural factors and, also, psychological
variables. In this section, given that voters are analyzed within the context
of consumer behavior theory, inflation and unemployment are considered as the
most important economic factors. The second group of factors focuses more on
the type of voting, with emphasis on government performance. Since the
incumbent government and its supportive voters are in a game with two Nash
equilibrium, and also because the voters in most cases are retrospect, the
government seeks to keep its position by a deliberate change in economic
factors, especially inflation and unemployment rates. Finally, to better
understand the issue, a hypothetical example is presented and analyzed in a
developing country in the form of a state-owned populist employment plan.

Motivation: 探讨央行以分位数效用目标最大化时的最优货币政策，建立风险态度与宏观经济不利情况关注的联系。

Method: 用含分位数算子的贝尔曼方程构建无限期问题，用欧拉方程法推导泰勒规则型反应函数，用间接推断法推导央行风险厌恶隐含分位数指数，基于有条件异方差的简化运动定律进行实证。

Result: 美联储大多呈现鸽派行为，但有一些时期表现出鹰派态度。

Conclusion: 可通过分位数效用目标分析央行货币政策，且能据此判断央行风险态度。

Abstract: We study optimal monetary policy when a central bank maximizes a quantile
utility objective rather than expected utility. In our framework, the central
bank's risk attitude is indexed by the quantile index level, providing a
transparent mapping between hawkish/dovish stances and attention to adverse
macroeconomic realizations. We formulate the infinite-horizon problem using a
Bellman equation with the quantile operator. Implementing an Euler-equation
approach, we derive Taylor-rule-type reaction functions. Using an indirect
inference approach, we derive a central bank risk aversion implicit quantile
index. An empirical implementation for the US is outlined based on reduced-form
laws of motion with conditional heteroskedasticity, enabling estimation of the
new monetary policy rule and its dependence on the Fed risk attitudes. The
results reveal that the Fed has mostly a dovish-type behavior but with some
periods of hawkish attitudes.

Result: 对学生自我概念、拖延和学习乐趣有影响，对考试成绩、通过率和知识保留无显著积极影响，发现教学方法使用不足。

Conclusion: 需要额外的教学策略来提升教学效果。

Abstract: This study uses double/debiased machine learning (DML) to evaluate the impact
of transitioning from lecture-based blended teaching to a flipped classroom
concept. Our findings indicate effects on students' self-conception,
procrastination, and enjoyment. We do not find significant positive effects on
exam scores, passing rates, or knowledge retention. This can be explained by
the insufficient use of the instructional approach that we can identify with
uniquely detailed usage data and highlights the need for additional teaching
strategies. Methodologically, we propose a powerful DML approach that
acknowledges the latent structure inherent in Likert scale variables and,
hence, aligns with psychometric principles.

Motivation: 现有工具在处理大规模基因组数据时难以高效扩展，需新工具。

Method: 对PanDelos进行全并行、以基因为中心的重新设计，通过数据分解和线程池策略并行化计算密集阶段，采用轻量级数据结构减少内存使用。

Result: 在合成数据集上，PanDelos-plus执行速度快达14倍，内存使用减少达96%，且保持准确性。

Conclusion: 改进使群体规模比较基因组学能在标准多核工作站上进行，使大规模细菌泛基因组分析可用于日常研究。

Abstract: The identification of homologous gene families across multiple genomes is a
central task in bacterial pangenomics traditionally requiring computationally
demanding all-against-all comparisons. PanDelos addresses this challenge with
an alignment-free and parameter-free approach based on k-mer profiles,
combining high speed, ease of use, and competitive accuracy with
state-of-the-art methods. However, the increasing availability of genomic data
requires tools that can scale efficiently to larger datasets. To address this
need, we present PanDelos-plus, a fully parallel, gene-centric redesign of
PanDelos. The algorithm parallelizes the most computationally intensive phases
(Best Hit detection and Bidirectional Best Hit extraction) through data
decomposition and a thread pool strategy, while employing lightweight data
structures to reduce memory usage. Benchmarks on synthetic datasets show that
PanDelos-plus achieves up to 14x faster execution and reduces memory usage by
up to 96%, while maintaining accuracy. These improvements enable
population-scale comparative genomics to be performed on standard multicore
workstations, making large-scale bacterial pangenome analysis accessible for
routine use in everyday research.

Conclusion: 分析结果可用于去中心化选择系统的公平设计干预。

Abstract: We study a two-institution stable matching model in which candidates from two
distinct groups are evaluated using partially correlated signals that are
group-biased. This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate
candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which
institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These
evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as
standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with
local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta
\in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the
correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between
institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of
disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this
setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same
institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a
closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows
that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast,
we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and
even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation
ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional
selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural
conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most
effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions
for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.

Abstract: Understanding how individual learning behavior and structural dynamics
interact is essential to modeling emergent phenomena in socioeconomic networks.
While bounded rationality and network adaptation have been widely studied, the
role of heterogeneous learning rates both at the agent and network levels
remains under explored. This paper introduces a dual-learning framework that
integrates individualized learning rates for agents and a rewiring rate for the
network, reflecting real-world cognitive diversity and structural adaptability.
  Using a simulation model based on the Prisoner's Dilemma and Quantal Response
Equilibrium, we analyze how variations in these learning rates affect the
emergence of large-scale network structures. Results show that lower and more
homogeneously distributed learning rates promote scale-free networks, while
higher or more heterogeneously distributed learning rates lead to the emergence
of core-periphery topologies. Key topological metrics including scale-free
exponents, Estrada heterogeneity, and assortativity reveal that both the speed
and variability of learning critically shape system rationality and network
architecture. This work provides a unified framework for examining how
individual learnability and structural adaptability drive the formation of
socioeconomic networks with diverse topologies, offering new insights into
adaptive behavior, systemic organization, and resilience.

Conclusion: 基于Hecuba的原位处理方法可有效应对天文学与宇宙学大数据的存储和分析挑战，实现实时原位可视化。

Abstract: Modern simulations and observations in Astronomy & Cosmology (A&C) produce
massively large data volumes, posing significant challenges for storage, access
and data analysis. A long-standing bottleneck in high-performance computing,
especially now in the exascale era, has been the requirement to write these
large datasets to disks, which limits the performance. A promising solution to
this challenge is in-situ processing, where analysis and visualization are
performed concurrently with the simulation itself, bypassing the storage of the
simulation data. In this work, we present new results from an approach for
in-situ processing based on Hecuba, a framework that provides a highly
distributed database for streaming A&C simulation data directly into the
visualization pipeline to make possible on-line visualization. By integrating
Hecuba with the high-performance cosmological simulator ChaNGa, we enable
real-time, in-situ visualization of N-body simulation results using tools such

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天文学与宇宙学领域模拟和观测数据量与质量增长，存储是高性能计算瓶颈，且大规模数据需合适工具提取科学内容，可视化需数据过滤。

Method: 使用Hecuba框架，该框架提供高度分布式数据库来流式传输数据用于在线可视化，并将Hecuba平台与Changa宇宙学模拟器集成。

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及结论内容，但提出运行分析和可视化与模拟并行，绕过完整结果存储是解决问题的方案。

Abstract: The Astronomy & Cosmology (A&C) community is presently witnessing an
unprecedented growth in the quality and quantity of data coming from
simulations and observations. Writing results of numerical simulations to disk
files has long been a bottleneck in high-performance computing. To access
effectively and extract the scientific content of such large-scale data sets
appropriate tools and techniques are needed. This is especially true for
visualization tools, where petascale data size problems cannot be visualized
without some data filtering, which reduces either the resolution or the amount
of data volume managed by the visualization tool.
  A solution to this problem is to run the analysis and visualization
concurrently (in-situ) with the simulation and bypass the storage of the full
results. In particular we use Hecuba, a framework offering a highly distributed
database to stream A\&C simulation data for on-line visualization. We will
demonstrate the Hecuba platform integration with the Changa high performant
cosmological simulator and the in-situ visualization of its N-body results with
the ParaView and VisIVO tools.

TL;DR: 提出距离多指标异常检测方法DiMMAD，用距离指标集合检测异常，在天文学时间序列数据上验证，优于其他方法，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于距离的异常检测方法依赖单一用户选择的距离指标，在天文学复杂高维特征空间中可能不是最优的，需解决指标选择问题。

Method: 引入DiMMAD方法，使用多种距离指标的集合来检测异常，克服指标选择问题。

Result: DiMMAD在分布外异常检测中表现出色，在发现新类别多样性上优于其他方法；在罕见分布内异常检测中表现与其他方法类似，但可提高可解释性。

Conclusion: DiMMAD是一种简单、可解释的异常检测方法，适用于天文学时间序列数据的科学发现。

Abstract: Distance-based methods involve the computation of distance values between
features and are a well-established paradigm in machine learning. In anomaly
detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data
points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single,
user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for
the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we
introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly
Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find
novelties.
  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different
geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance
metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score
that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this
multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery
on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C.
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the
Zwicky Transient Facility.
  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection --
anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other
state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes
discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs
similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability. All
our code is open source: DiMMAD is implemented within DistClassiPy:

results of this paper is available here: https://github.com/sidchaini/dimmad/.

Motivation: 寻找从预训练神经网络中识别星系形态候选单语义特征的有效方法，发现超越人类定义分类的天体物理现象。

Method: 在Euclid Q1图像上使用监督模型Zoobot和自监督模型MAE，对比SAEs和PCA。

Result: 公开的MAE模型实现超人图像重建性能，SAEs能识别框架外可解释特征，且特征比PCA与Galaxy Zoo标签对齐性更强。

Conclusion: 尽管存在可解释性挑战，SAEs为发现天体物理现象提供强大工具。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can efficiently identify candidate monosemantic
features from pretrained neural networks for galaxy morphology. We demonstrate
this on Euclid Q1 images using both supervised (Zoobot) and new self-supervised
(MAE) models. Our publicly released MAE achieves superhuman image
reconstruction performance. While a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
supervised model primarily identifies features already aligned with the Galaxy
Zoo decision tree, SAEs can identify interpretable features outside of this
framework. SAE features also show stronger alignment than PCA with Galaxy Zoo
labels. Although challenges in interpretability remain, SAEs provide a powerful
engine for discovering astrophysical phenomena beyond the confines of
human-defined classification.

TL;DR: 结合传统机器学习与图深度学习构建可扩展且可解释框架用于癌症转移风险预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数预测模型依赖浅层架构且忽略患者特定调节机制，而转移是癌症相关死亡的主要原因，因此需要更好的模型来预测转移潜力。

Method: 整合经典机器学习和深度学习，结合癌症细胞系百科全书的基因表达谱与转录因子 - 靶标先验信息，用Kruskal - Wallis检验选差异基因，训练ElasticNet、Random Forest和XGBoost模型进行基准测试，用PANDA和LIONESS构建个性化基因调控网络，通过图注意力神经网络分析。

Result: XGBoost的AUROC最高为0.7051，图神经网络能捕捉患者水平的非线性调控依赖关系。

Conclusion: 结合传统机器学习与基于图的深度学习能为精准肿瘤学中的转移风险预测提供可扩展且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet most
predictive models rely on shallow architectures and neglect patient-specific
regulatory mechanisms. Here, we integrate classical machine learning and deep
learning to predict metastatic potential across multiple cancer types. Gene
expression profiles from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia were combined with a
transcription factor-target prior from DoRothEA, focusing on nine
metastasis-associated regulators. After selecting differential genes using the
Kruskal-Wallis test, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained
for benchmarking. Personalized gene regulatory networks were then constructed
using PANDA and LIONESS and analyzed through a graph attention neural network
(GATv2) to learn topological and expression-based representations. While
XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC (0.7051), the GNN captured non-linear
regulatory dependencies at the patient level. These results demonstrate that
combining traditional machine learning with graph-based deep learning enables a
scalable and interpretable framework for metastasis risk prediction in
precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子网络架构中经典通信依赖传统加密，易受量子对手攻击。

Method: 采用后量子加密技术保障经典通信，对量子和经典层进行持续监控，跨异构基础设施编排。

Result: 提供了一种可扩展、健壮且安全的量子网络架构。

Conclusion: 这些机制为构建能抵御经典和量子时代威胁的量子网络提供途径。

Abstract: Quantum networks rely on both quantum and classical channels for coordinated
operation. Current architectures employ entanglement distribution and key
exchange over quantum channels but often assume that classical communication is
sufficiently secure. In practice, classical channels protected by traditional
cryptography remain vulnerable to quantum adversaries, since large-scale
quantum computers could break widely used public-key schemes and reduce the
effective security of symmetric cryptography. This perspective presents a
quantum-resistant network architecture that secures classical communication
with post-quantum cryptographic techniques while supporting entanglement-based
communication over quantum channels. Beyond cryptographic protection, the
framework incorporates continuous monitoring of both quantum and classical
layers, together with orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures, to
ensure end-to-end security. Collectively, these mechanisms provide a pathway
toward scalable, robust, and secure quantum networks that remain dependable
against both classical and quantum-era threats.

Motivation: 解决基于核的Wald/Hall - Sheather区间存在的带宽选择和边界问题，为分布无关的分位数推断提供实用方法。

Method: 构建自归一化枢轴，采用约束经验鞍点近似得到尾概率，通过反转尾面积得到置信区间和检验。

Result: 在蒙特卡罗实验中表现出稳定覆盖和有竞争力的区间长度，速度比大B重采样方案快；实证研究显示尾性能和计算效率提升。

Conclusion: SNQESA是核、自助法和经验似然法的实用、分析透明的替代方法，可自然扩展到两样本分位数差异和回归型设置。

Abstract: We propose a density-free method for frequentist inference on population
quantiles, termed Self-Normalized Quantile Empirical Saddlepoint Approximation
(SNQESA). The approach builds a self-normalized pivot from the indicator score
for a fixed quantile threshold and then employs a constrained empirical
saddlepoint approximation to obtain highly accurate tail probabilities.
Inverting these tail areas yields confidence intervals and tests without
estimating the unknown density at the target quantile, thereby eliminating
bandwidth selection and the boundary issues that affect kernel-based
Wald/Hall-Sheather intervals. Under mild local regularity, the resulting
procedures attain higher-order tail accuracy and second-order coverage after
inversion. Because the pivot is anchored in a bounded Bernoulli reduction, the
method remains reliable for skewed and heavy-tailed distributions and for
extreme quantiles. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments across light, heavy, and
multimodal distributions demonstrate that SNQESA delivers stable coverage and
competitive interval lengths in small to moderate samples while being orders of
magnitude faster than large-B resampling schemes. An empirical study on
Value-at-Risk with rolling windows further highlights the gains in tail
performance and computational efficiency. The framework naturally extends to
two-sample quantile differences and to regression-type settings, offering a
practical, analytically transparent alternative to kernel, bootstrap, and
empirical-likelihood methods for distribution-free quantile inference.

Conclusion: 通过大量数值研究证明了所提测试方法的有效性。

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of comparing regression functions, a
fundamental question in statistical inference with broad relevance to modern
applications such as data integration, transfer learning, and causal inference.
Existing approaches typically rely on smoothing techniques and are thus
hindered by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a generalized notion of
kernel-based conditional mean dependence that provides a new characterization
of the null hypothesis of equal regression functions. Building on this
reformulation, we develop two novel tests that leverage modern machine learning
methods for flexible estimation. We establish the asymptotic properties of the
test statistics, which hold under both fixed- and high-dimensional regimes.
Unlike existing methods that often require restrictive distributional
assumptions, our framework only imposes mild moment conditions. The efficacy of
the proposed tests is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

TL;DR: 介绍CountFormer用于类别无关的目标计数，在FSC - 147数据集上表现良好，结合基础模型可让计数系统接近人类结构感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计数模型难以像人类一样依靠视觉重复和结构关系计数，在复杂场景易出错。

Method: 基于CounTR架构，用自监督基础模型DINOv2替换视觉编码器，融入位置嵌入融合，通过轻量级卷积解码器将特征解码为密度图。

Result: 在FSC - 147数据集上性能与现有最优方法相当，在结构复杂或密集场景中精度更高。

Conclusion: 集成DINOv2等基础模型可使计数系统接近人类结构感知，推动实现通用、无样本的计数范式。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

Conclusion: 证明投影几何结合回归校正估计物体指标的可行性，为城市水生环境开发强大、低成本自动监测系统奠定基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

Motivation: 现有说明视频场景级字幕可能因未捕捉结构而缺乏连贯性和质量，影响教育效果，需解决此问题。

Method: 引入DynaStride管道，利用YouCookII数据集场景注释，进行自适应帧采样和多模态窗口化，采用多模态思维链过程生成动作 - 对象对，用动态步幅窗口选择算法优化融合。

Result: 与VLLaMA3和GPT - 4o等强基线对比，在N - 元语法和语义相似度指标上有持续提升，定性分析显示生成字幕时间连贯性和信息性更好。

Conclusion: DynaStride为改进AI驱动的说明性内容生成提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

Result: 评估了框架的设计考量，展示了Neural USD能够实现迭代和增量工作流程。

Conclusion: Neural USD框架有助于解决可控生成建模中精确迭代对象编辑的问题。

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

Motivation: 传统图像防护模型因基于纯特征学习、缺乏语义推理，存在误分类、难适应新威胁等问题，现有不安全图像基准数据集有缺陷。

Method: 引入SafeVision，采用有效数据收集与生成框架、遵循策略的训练管道和定制损失函数，提出多样化问答生成与训练策略；引入VisionHarm数据集。

Result: SafeVision在不同基准测试中达最优性能，在VisionHarm-T上比GPT - 4o高8.6%，在VisionHarm-C上高15.5%，速度快超16倍。

Conclusion: SafeVision是全面、遵循策略、可解释且能动态适应新威胁的图像防护模型。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

Result: 分析显示火星特定基础模型可能优于通用领域模型。

Conclusion: Mars - Bench为火星科学机器学习模型开发和比较建立了标准化基础。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

Result: 在CIFAR - 10数据集上，ResNet - 18准确率达89.9%，传统深度CNN为84.1%，且ResNet - 18收敛更快、训练更稳定。

Conclusion: ResNet能有效克服CNN训练深层网络的梯度消失问题，提升训练效果。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

Motivation: 现代文本到图像模型在组合性上存在问题，难以准确呈现对象数量、属性和空间关系。

Method: 利用大语言模型从输入提示合成显式布局，注入图像生成过程，以对象为中心的视觉语言模型对多个候选结果迭代重排序选择最符合提示的结果。

Conclusion: 统一显式布局基础与基于自精炼的推理时间缩放的框架有效提升了文本到图像模型的性能。

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing
coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing
video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a
comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V
models.We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective,
decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all
benchmark tools and code at https://github.com/qyr0403/VC4VG to support further
research.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are
available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/SNELL.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on
safety-critical autonomous driving tasks. Code and prompt are available at

Conclusion: 从业者可统一提升预训练视觉模型的可解释性和可分类性。

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: ViPER能提升模型感知能力，证明了生成与理解的互惠关系，有助于开发更自主、更强大的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Conclusion: 提示学习是缩小卫星和航空影像领域差距的可扩展且高效的解决方案，为该领域未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Result: 在八个基准数据集上实验，UtilGen平均准确率比之前SOTA提高3.87%，生成的数据更有影响力且与任务相关。

Conclusion: 从视觉特征中心到任务效用中心的数据增强范式转变有效。

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VDMs比语言模型有更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: 视频预训练提供的归纳偏置有助于视觉基础模型的进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

Motivation: 此前不清楚预训练ViTs是否自然具备对象绑定能力，受自注意力机制二次性质启发，假设ViTs能表示两个图块是否属于同一对象。

Method: 使用相似性探针从ViT各层的图块嵌入中解码IsSameObject属性。

Result: 解码准确率超90%，自监督ViTs对象绑定能力强，ImageNet监督模型较弱，IsSameObject编码在低维子空间且引导注意力，去除该信号会降低下游性能。

Conclusion: 挑战了ViTs缺乏对象绑定能力的观点，强调了符号知识在连接主义系统中自然涌现。

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Result: GVS实现了稳定、无碰撞、帧间一致且能闭环的相机引导视频生成，适用于多种预定义相机路径。

Conclusion: GVS有效解决了自回归视频扩散模型在相机引导视频生成中的问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between antibody sequence, structure and
function is essential for the design of antibody-based therapeutics and
research tools. Recently, machine learning (ML) models mostly based on the
application of large language models to sequence information have been
developed to predict antibody properties. Yet there are open directions to
incorporate structural information, not only to enhance prediction but also to
offer insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. This chapter provides
an overview of these approaches and describes two ML frameworks that integrate
structural data (via graph representations) with neural networks to predict
properties of antibodies: ANTIPASTI predicts binding affinity (a global
property) whereas INFUSSE predicts residue flexibility (a local property). We
survey the principles underpinning these models; the ways in which they encode
structural knowledge; and the strategies that can be used to extract
biologically relevant statistical signals that can help discover and
disentangle molecular determinants of the properties of interest.
