In supervised clustering, one aims to infer a meaningful partitioning of data using a small labeled subset. However, the sheer volume of training data in modern applications poses a significant computational challenge. The MCS problem formalizes this goal: given a labeled dataset $\\mathcal{X}$ in a metric space, the task is to compute a smallest subset $S \\subseteq \\mathcal{X}$ such that every point in $\\mathcal{X}$ shares its label with at least one of its nearest neighbors in $S$.\n  Recently, the MCS problem has been extended to graph metrics, where distances are defined by shortest paths. Prior work has shown that MCS remains NP-hard even on simple graph classes like trees, though an algorithm with runtime $\\mathcal{O}(2^{6c} \\cdot n^6)$ is known for trees, where $c$ is the number of colors and $n$ the number of vertices. This raises the challenge of identifying graph classes that admit algorithms efficient in both $n$ and $c$.\n  In this work, we study the Minimum Consistent Subset problem on graphs, focusing on two well-established measures: the vertex cover number ($vc$) and the neighborhood diversity ($nd$). We develop an algorithm with running time $vc^{\\mathcal{O}(vc)}\\cdot\\text{Poly}(n,c)$, and another algorithm with runtime $nd^{\\mathcal{O}(nd)}\\cdot\\text{Poly}(n,c)$. In the language of parameterized complexity, this implies that MCS is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the vertex cover number and the neighborhood diversity. Notably, our algorithms remain efficient for arbitrarily many colors, as their complexity is polynomially dependent on the number of colors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Accurate estimates are essential for generating efficient query execution plans. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to CE, broadly categorized into query-driven and data-driven approaches. Data-driven methods learn the joint distribution of data, while query-driven methods construct regression models that map query features to cardinalities. Ideally, a CE technique should strike a balance among three key factors: accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint. However, existing state-of-the-art models often fail to achieve this balance.\n  To address this, we propose CoLSE, a hybrid learned approach for single-table cardinality estimation. CoLSE directly models the joint probability over queried intervals using a novel algorithm based on copula theory and integrates a lightweight neural network to correct residual estimation errors.

With Large Language Models (LLMs), queries are increasingly machine-generated, while humans read, validate, and debug them. This shift turns relational query languages into interfaces for back-and-forth communication about intent, which will lead to a rethinking of relational language design, and more broadly, relational interface design.\n  We argue that this rethinking needs support from an Abstract Relational Query Language (ARQL): a semantics-first reference metalanguage that separates query intent from user-facing syntax and makes underlying relational patterns explicit and comparable across user-facing languages. An ARQL separates a query into (i) a relational core (the compositional structure that determines intent), (ii) modalities (alternative representations of that core tailored to different audiences), and (iii) conventions (orthogonal environment-level semantic parameters under which the core is interpreted, e.g., set vs. bag semantics, or treatment of null values). Usability for humans or machines then depends less on choosing a particular language and more on choosing an appropriate modality. Comparing languages becomes a question of which relational patterns they support and what conventions they choose.\n  We introduce Abstract Relational Calculus (ARC), a strict generalization of Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC), as a concrete instance of ARQL.

Due to the distributed and noncooperative nature of the game, some curious agents may wish to steal sensitive information from neighboring agents during parameter exchanges. Additionally, communication delays arising from network congestion, particularly in wireless settings, as well as feedback delays, can hinder the convergence of agents to a Nash equilibrium. Although a recent work addressed both communication and feedback delays in aggregative games, it is based on the unrealistic assumption that the delays are fixed over time and identical across agents. Hence, the case of time-varying and non-identical delays across agents has never been considered in aggregative games. In this work, we address the combined challenges of privacy leakage with time-varying and non-identical communication and feedback delays for the first time. We propose an online distributed dual averaging algorithm that simultaneously tackles these challenges while achieving a provably low regret bound.

This paper proposes EXFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for forecasting the daily exchange rate returns. We introduce a multi-scale trend-aware self-attention mechanism that employs parallel convolutional branches with differing receptive fields to align observations on the basis of local slopes, preserving long-range dependencies while remaining sensitive to regime shifts. A dynamic variable selector assigns time-varying importance weights to 28 exogenous covariates related to exchange rate returns, providing pre-hoc interpretability. An embedded squeeze-and-excitation block recalibrates channel responses to emphasize informative features and depress noise in the forecasting. Using the daily data for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD, we conduct out-of-sample evaluations across five different sliding windows. EXFormer consistently outperforms the random walk and other baselines, improving directional accuracy by a statistically significant margin of up to 8.5--22.8%. In nearly one year of trading backtests, the model converts these gains into cumulative returns of 18%, 25%, and 18% for the three pairs, with Sharpe ratios exceeding 1.8. When conservative transaction costs and slippage are accounted for, EXFormer retains cumulative returns of 7%, 19%, and 9%, while other baselines achieve negative.

Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG.

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8eArtificial Age Score\u5f00\u53d1\u9762\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5b50\u53e5\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u2018\u7c7b\u81ea\u6211\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u83b1\u5e03\u5c3c\u8328\u300a\u5355\u5b50\u8bba\u300b\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5728AAS\u5185\u6838\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u516d\u6b21Python\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b50\u53e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5982AAS\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u6709\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5b50\u7684\u5b50\u53e5\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5AAS\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u84dd\u56fe\u3002"}}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control.

Momentum exhibits clear hyperbolic decay (R^2 = 0.65), outperforming linear (0.51) and exponential (0.61) baselines -- validating the equilibrium foundation. (2) Not all factors crowd equally. Mechanical factors (momentum, reversal) fit the model; judgment-based factors (value, quality) do not -- consistent with a signal-ambiguity taxonomy paralleling Hua and Sun's \"barriers to entry.\" (3) Crowding accelerated post-2015. Out-of-sample, the model over-predicts remaining alpha (0.30 vs. 0.15), correlating with factor ETF growth (rho = -0.63). (4) Average returns are efficiently priced. Crowding-based factor selection fails to generate alpha (Sharpe: 0.22 vs. 0.39 factor momentum benchmark). (5) Crowding predicts tail risk. Out-of-sample (2001--2024), crowded reversal factors show 1.7--1.8x higher crash probability (bottom decile returns), while crowded momentum shows lower crash risk (0.38x, p = 0.006).

VC can be leveraged for rapid prototyping or developing the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs); however, it may introduce several risks throughout the software development life cycle. Based on our experience from several internally developed MVPs and a review of recent industry reports, this article analyzes the flow-debt tradeoffs associated with VC. The flow-debt trade-off arises when the seamless code generation occurs, leading to the accumulation of technical debt through architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance overhead. These issues originate from process-level weaknesses, biases in model training data, a lack of explicit design rationale, and a tendency to prioritize quick code generation over human-driven iterative development.

For example, a calculator crunches numbers more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and require GPUs for the multiplication of huge matrices. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) of the brain have no matrix multiplication and much smaller energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a framework for thinking about popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables.

Additionally, stochtree offers flexible handling of model fits: the ability to save model fits, reinitialize models from existing fits (facilitating improved model initialization heuristics), and pass fits between R and Python. On both platforms, stochtree exposes lower-level functionality, allowing users to specify models incorporating Bayesian tree ensembles without needing to modify C++ code. We illustrate the use of stochtree in three settings: i) straightfoward applications of existing models such as BART and BCF, ii) models that include more sophisticated components like heteroskedasticity and leaf-wise regression models, and iii) as a component of custom MCMC routines to fit nonstandard tree ensemble models.", "AI": {"tldr": "stochtree\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684C++\u5e93\uff0c\u652f\u6301R\u548cPython\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e93\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1stochtree\u5e93\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bR\u548cPython\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5e95\u5c42\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "stochtree\u5e93\u80fd\u5728R\u548cPython\u5e73\u53f0\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u4f20\u9012\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "stochtree\u5e93\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We extend the Monti-Klein model of monopolistic banking by incorporating risk aversion, subjective beliefs, and ambiguity aversion. The model predicts that greater inflation uncertainty or asymmetry in beliefs raises equilibrium loan rates and amplifies credit rationing. Using AnaCredit loan-level data for France, we estimate finite-mixture density regressions that allow for latent heterogeneity in loan pricing. Empirically, we find that higher subjective uncertainty and asymmetry both increase average lending rates and skew their distribution, disproportionately affecting financially constrained firms in the right tail. Quantitatively, moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of our indicators raises average borrowing costs by more than 10 basis points, which translates into roughly 0.5 billion euros of additional annual interest expenses for non-financial corporations. By contrast, forecast disagreement has a weaker and less systematic effect.

We show that modular vaults differ in capital utilization, cross-chain and cross asset concentration, and liquidity risk structure. Further, we show that a small set of curators intermediates a disproportionate share of system TVL, exhibits clustered tail co movement, and captures markedly different fee margins despite broadly similar collateral composition. These findings indicate that the main locus of risk in DeFi lending has migrated upward from base protocols, where underwriting is effectively centralized in a single DAO governed parameter set, to a permissionless curator layer in which competing vault managers decide which assets and loans are originated. We argue that this shift requires a corresponding upgrade in transparency standards and outline a simple set of onchain disclosures that would allow users and DAOs to evaluate curator strategies on a comparable, money market style basis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4fe1\u8d37\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DeFi\u501f\u8d37\u98ce\u9669\u4e3b\u56e0\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u534f\u8bae\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7b56\u5c55\u4eba\u5c42\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4fe1\u8d37\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790ERC 4626\u91d1\u5e93\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7b56\u5c55\u4eba\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u91d1\u5e93\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7b56\u5c55\u4eba\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u9501\u4ed3\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u91d1\u5e93\u5728\u8d44\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7b56\u5c55\u4eba\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7cfb\u7edfTVL\u4e14\u5c3e\u90e8\u5171\u52a8\u5448\u96c6\u7fa4\u72b6\uff0c\u6536\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u8d39\u7528\u3002\u98ce\u9669\u4e3b\u56e0\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u534f\u8bae\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7b56\u5c55\u4eba\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u8981\u6c42\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u94fe\u4e0a\u62ab\u9732\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u65b9\u4fbf\u7528\u6237\u548cDAO\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u5c55\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We observe that (1) inference nodes exhibit sustained CPU underutilization (peak <= 20%), and (2) EMT gradients possess intrinsic low-rank structure, enabling compact update representation. We present LiveUpdate, a system that eliminates inter-cluster synchronization by colocating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) trainers within inference nodes. LiveUpdate addresses two core challenges: (1) dynamic rank adaptation via singular value monitoring to constrain memory overhead (<2% of EMTs), and (2) NUMA-aware resource scheduling with hardware-enforced QoS to eliminate update inference contention (P99 latency impact <20ms). Evaluations show LiveUpdate reduces update costs by 2x versus delta-update baselines while achieving higher accuracy within 1-hour windows.

Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best.

Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u884c\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cH2O\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684SnapKV\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97\u9a71\u9010\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u957f\u89e3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u51e0\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7c7b\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff1bH2O\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684SnapKV\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97\u9a71\u9010\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9002\u7528\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u91cd\u5c3e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology.

We hedge a normalized option-implied equity exposure (one unit of underlying delta, offset via SPY) by trading the underlying index ETF, using the option surface and macro variables only as state information and not as a direct pricing engine. Building on the \"deep hedging\" paradigm of Buehler et al. (2019), we design a leak-free environment, a cost-aware reward function, and a lightweight stochastic actor-critic agent trained on daily end-of-day panel data constructed from SPX/SPY implied volatility term structure, skew, realized volatility, and macro rate context. On a fixed train/validation/test split, the learned policy improves risk-adjusted performance versus no-hedge, momentum, and volatility-targeting baselines (higher point-estimate Sharpe); only the GAE policy's test-sample Sharpe is statistically distinguishable from zero, although confidence intervals overlap with a long-SPY benchmark so we stop short of claiming formal dominance. Turnover remains controlled and the policy is robust to doubled transaction costs.

Existing aerodynamics datasets are either limited to 2D simulations, lack optimization, or derive diversity solely from perturbations to a single baseline design, constraining their application as benchmarks to inverse design approaches and in the study of design diversity. The OptiWing3D dataset addresses these gaps, consisting of 1552 simulations resulting in 776 wing designs initialized from distinct extruded airfoil cross-sections. Additionally, a majority of the optimized wings in the dataset are paired to 2D counterparts optimized under identical conditions, creating the first multi-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization dataset. Moreover, this structure allows for a direct comparison between 2D and 3D aerodynamic simulations. It is observed that 3D optimized designs diverge most prominently from the 2D-optimized designs near the wingtip, where three-dimensional effects are strongest, a finding made possible by the paired nature of the dataset. Finally, we demonstrate a constraint-aware conditional latent diffusion model capable of generating optimized wings from flow conditions, establishing a baseline for future inverse design approaches.

We revisit this paradox through the lens of stability, the property that small perturbations to a query do not radically alter its nearest neighbors. Building on foundational results, we extend stability theory to three key retrieval settings widely used in practice: (i) multi-vector search, where we prove that the popular Chamfer distance metric preserves single-vector stability, while average pooling aggregation may destroy it; (ii) filtered vector search, where we show that sufficiently large penalties for mismatched filters can induce stability even when the underlying search is unstable; and (iii) sparse vector search, where we formalize and prove novel sufficient stability conditions.

However, a theoretical understanding of these differences is missing, particularly when both the sample size $n$ and the dimension $d$ are large. LA and Gaussian VI are justified by Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorems, and recent work has derived the characteristic condition $n\\gg d^2$ for their validity, improving over the condition $n\\gg d^3$. In this paper, we show for linear, logistic and Poisson regression that for $n\\gtrsim d$, MCMC attains the same complexity scaling in $n$, $d$ as first-order optimization algorithms, up to sub-polynomial factors. Thus MCMC is competitive with LA and Gaussian VI in complexity, under a scaling between $n$ and $d$ more general than BvM regimes. Our complexities apply to appropriately scaled priors that are not necessarily Gaussian-tailed, including Student-$t$ and flat priors, with log-posteriors that are not necessarily globally concave or gradient-Lipschitz.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728n\u548cd\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0bMCMC\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0eLA\u548cGaussian VI\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\u3001Laplace approximation (LA)\u548cvariational inference (VI)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u53d6\u820d\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u6837\u672c\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5728ngtrsim d\u65f6\uff0cMCMC\u4e0e\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684n\u548cd\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0eLA\u548cGaussian VI\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MCMC\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4e0eLA\u548cGaussian VI\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5c3e\u5148\u9a8c\u3002"}}

This survey reviews and organizes the growing literature on XAI for economic time series, where autocorrelation, non-stationarity, seasonality, mixed frequencies, and regime shifts can make standard explanation techniques unreliable or economically implausible. We propose a taxonomy that classifies methods by (i) explanation mechanism: propagation-based approaches (e.g., Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation), perturbation and game-theoretic attribution (e.g., permutation importance, LIME, SHAP), and function-based global tools (e.g., Accumulated Local Effects); (ii) time-series compatibility, including preservation of temporal dependence, stability over time, and respect for data-generating constraints. We synthesize time-series-specific adaptations such as vector- and window-based formulations (e.g., Vector SHAP, WindowSHAP) that reduce lag fragmentation and computational cost while improving interpretability. We also connect explainability to causal inference and policy analysis through interventional attributions (Causal Shapley values) and constrained counterfactual reasoning.

We test this hypothesis in the Iranian stock market, an economy that is highly isolated, subject to capital controls, and largely inaccessible to foreign investors. Using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, we analyze two major bubble episodes in 2020 and 2023. The estimated critical exponents beta around 0.46 and 0.20 fall within the empirical ranges documented for canonical historical bubbles such as the 1929 DJIA crash and the 2000 Nasdaq episode. The Tehran Stock Exchange displays clear LPPLS hallmarks, including faster-than-exponential price acceleration, log-periodic corrections, and stable estimates of the critical time horizon. These results indicate that endogenous herding, imitation, and positive-feedback dynamics, rather than exogenous shocks, play a dominant role even in politically and economically isolated markets. By showing that an emerging and semi-closed financial system conforms to the same dynamical patterns observed in global markets, this paper provides new empirical support for the universality of bubble dynamics.

In such environments, agents are often responsible for optimizing resource usage across deployed services. However, agent decisions can lead to persistent conflict loops, inefficient resource utilization, and degraded service performance. To overcome such challenges, we propose a novel framework for adaptive conflict resolution in resource-oriented orchestration using a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach. The framework enables handling resource conflicts across deployments and integrates a DRL model trained to mediate such conflicts based on real-time performance feedback and historical state information. The framework has been prototyped and validated on a Kubernetes-based testbed, illustrating its methodological feasibility and architectural resilience.

While supplying GenAI with detailed personal information improves representation fidelity, feasibility constraints make complete information access impractical. We bridge this gap by developing a game-theoretic framework that models strategic information revelation to GenAI in collective decision-making. The technical challenges lie in characterizing members' equilibrium behaviors under interdependent strategies and quantifying the imperfect preference learning outcomes by digital representatives. Our contribution includes closed-form equilibrium characterizations that reveal how members strategically balance team decision preference against communication costs. Our analysis yields an interesting finding: Conflicting preferences between team members drive competitive information revelation, with members revealing more information than those with aligned preferences. While digital representatives produce aggregate preference losses no smaller than direct participation, individual members may paradoxically achieve decisions more closely aligned with their preferences when using digital representatives, particularly when manual participation costs are high or when GenAI systems are sufficiently advanced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u62ab\u9732\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u5458\u504f\u597d\u51b2\u7a81\u4f1a\u4fc3\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u4ee3\u8868\u867d\u6709\u504f\u597d\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u5458\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u83b7\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u504f\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5448\u73b0\u504f\u597d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u83b7\u53d6\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5747\u8861\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u5458\u504f\u597d\u51b2\u7a81\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u4ee3\u8868\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u597d\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6210\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u4ee3\u8868\u53ef\u83b7\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u504f\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6210\u5458\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u4e0a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u5b57\u4ee3\u8868\u5728\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo (\"Astronomy Shop\") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points).

This study introduces Mirror Mode, a new game mode where the enemy AI mimics the personal strategy of a player to challenge them to keep changing their gameplay. A simplified version of the Nintendo strategy video game Fire Emblem Heroes has been built in Unity, with a Standard Mode and a Mirror Mode. Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants. The gameplay of the participants indicates good imitation in defensive behavior, but not in offensive strategies.

To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting.

Traditional bibliometric indicators, such as citation counts, fail to address this friction in a timely manner due to the systemic latency inherent in data accumulation. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the Economic Reasoning Alignment via Instruction Tuning (ERA-IT) framework. We theoretically conceptualize patent renewal history as a revealed economic preference and leverage it as an objective supervisory signal to align the generative reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with market realities, a process we term Eco-Semantic Alignment. Using a randomly sampled dataset of 10,000 European Patent Office patents across diverse technological domains, we trained the model not only to predict value tiers but also to reverse-engineer the Economic Chain-of-Thought from unstructured text. Empirical results demonstrate that ERA-IT significantly outperforms both conventional econometric models and zero-shot LLMs in predictive accuracy.

Recent advances leverage Transformer-based architectures to capture global dependencies, but existing methods often suffer from high computational overhead, primarily due to discontinuous memory access in temporal encoding and dense attention over long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose FuXi-$\u03b3$, a novel sequential recommendation framework that improves both effectiveness and efficiency through principled architectural design. FuXi-$\u03b3$ adopts a decoder-only Transformer structure and introduces two key innovations: (1) An exponential-power temporal encoder that encodes relative temporal intervals using a tunable exponential decay function inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. This encoder enables flexible modeling of both short-term and long-term preferences while maintaining high efficiency through continuous memory access and pure matrix operations. (2) A diagonal-sparse positional mechanism that prunes low-contribution attention blocks using a diagonal-sliding strategy guided by the persymmetry of Toeplitz matrix. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\u03b3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation quality, while accelerating training by up to 4.74$\\times$ and inference by up to 6.18$\\times$, making it a practical and scalable solution for long-sequence recommendation.

The SPM monitors neuron activations and edge-wise weight update statistics over short temporal windows and uses these signals to trigger neuron insertion and pruning, while synaptic weights are updated by a standard gradient-based optimizer.

We formulate flow matching in an infinite-dimensional function space to learn a probabilistic transport that maps low-fidelity approximations to the manifold of high-fidelity PDE solutions via learned residual corrections. We develop a conditional neural operator architecture based on feature-wise linear modulation for flow-matching vector fields directly in function space, enabling inference at arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining. To improve stability and representational control of the induced neural ODE, we parameterize the flow vector field as a sum of a linear operator and a nonlinear operator, combining lightweight linear components with a conditioned Fourier neural operator for expressive, input-dependent dynamics. We then formulate a residual-augmented learning strategy where the flow model learns probabilistic corrections from inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates to high-fidelity solutions, rather than learning the full solution mapping from scratch. Finally, we derive tractable training objectives that extend conditional flow matching to the operator setting with input-function-dependent couplings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical experiments on a range of PDEs, including the 1D advection and Burgers' equation, and a 2D Darcy flow problem for flow through a porous medium.\n  We show that the proposed method can accurately learn solution operators across different resolutions and fidelities and produces uncertainty estimates that appropriately reflect model confidence, even when trained on limited high-fidelity data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5230\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u6216\u727a\u7272\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5236\u5b9a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7ebf\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6d41\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u6b8b\u5dee\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6982\u7387\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Submitted to Quantitative Finance and Economics", "summary": "We develop a rigorous walk-forward validation framework for algorithmic trading designed to mitigate overfitting and lookahead bias. Our methodology combines interpretable hypothesis-driven signal generation with reinforcement learning and strict out-of-sample testing. The framework enforces strict information set discipline, employs rolling window validation across 34 independent test periods, maintains complete interpretability through natural language hypothesis explanations, and incorporates realistic transaction costs and position constraints. Validating five market microstructure patterns across 100 US equities from 2015 to 2024, the system yields modest annualized returns (0.55%, Sharpe ratio 0.33) with exceptional downside protection (maximum drawdown -2.76%) and market-neutral characteristics (beta = 0.058). Performance exhibits strong regime dependence, generating positive returns during high-volatility periods (0.60% quarterly, 2020-2024) while underperforming in stable markets (-0.16%, 2015-2019). We report statistically insignificant aggregate results (p-value 0.34) to demonstrate a reproducible, honest validation protocol that prioritizes interpretability and extends naturally to advanced hypothesis generators, including large language models.

Current benchmarks, however, evaluate VSS primarily on the recall-latency trade-off against a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice.\n  We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations.

Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths.

However, precisely measuring the energy consumption of LLMs is often infeasible because hardware-based power monitors are not always accessible and software-based energy measurement tools are not accurate. While various prediction techniques have been developed to estimate LLM energy consumption, these approaches are limited to single-GPU environments and thus are not applicable to modern LLM inference which is typically parallelized across multiple GPUs. In this work, we remedy this gap and introduce PIE-P, a fine-grained energy prediction framework for multi-GPU inference, including tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. Predicting the energy under parallelized inference is complicated by the non-determinism in inter-GPU communication, additional communication overheads, and difficulties in isolating energy during the communication/synchronization phase. We develop a scalable prediction framework that addresses these issues via precise sampling, fine-grained modeling of inter-GPU communication, and careful accounting of parallelization overhead.

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid.

We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead.

Existing spatial stream network (SSN) models adapt spatial process models to river networks by creating covariance functions that account for stream distance, but preprocessing and estimation with these models is both computationally and time intensive, thus precluding the application of these models to regional or continental scales. This paper introduces a new class of Scalable Spatial Stream Network (S3N) models, which extend nearest-neighbor Gaussian processes to incorporate ecologically relevant spatial dependence while greatly improving computational efficiency. The S3N framework enables scalable modeling of spatial stream networks, demonstrated here for 285 fish species in the Ohio River Basin (>4,000 river km). Validation analyses show that S3N accurately recovers spatial and covariance parameters, even with reduced bias and variance compared to standard SSN implementations. These results represent a key advancement toward large-scale mapping of freshwater fish distributions and quantifying the influence of environmental drivers across extensive river networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\uff08S3N\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u57df\u6216\u5927\u9646\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6de1\u6c34\u9c7c\u5206\u5e03\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5236\u56fe\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SSN\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u57df\u6216\u5927\u9646\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u6de1\u6c34\u751f\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\uff08S3N\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u7eb3\u5165\u751f\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "S3N\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6 SSN \u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "S3N \u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6de1\u6c34\u9c7c\u5206\u5e03\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5236\u56fe\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u73af\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u6cb3\u7f51\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

While pricing interventions have shown potential to reduce meat intake, previous studies have focused on highly constrained environments with limited consumer choice. Here, we present the first large-scale field experiment to evaluate multiple pricing interventions in a real-world, competitive setting. Using a sequential crossover design with matched menus in a Swiss university campus, we systematically compared vegetarian-meal discounts (-2.5 CHF), meat surcharges (+2.5 CHF), and a combined scheme (-1.2 CHF=+1.2 CHF) across four campus cafeterias. Only the surcharge and combined interventions led to significant increases in vegetarian meal uptake--by 26.4% and 16.6%, respectively--and reduced CO2 emissions per meal by 7.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The surcharge, while effective, triggered a 12.3% drop in sales at intervention sites and a corresponding 14.9% increase in non-treated locations, hence causing a spillover effect that completely offset environmental gains. In contrast, the combined approach achieved meaningful emission reductions without significant effects on overall sales or revenue, making it both effective and economically viable. Notably, pricing interventions were equally effective for both vegetarian-leaning customers and habitual meat-eaters, stimulating change even within entrenched dietary habits. Our results show that balanced pricing strategies can reduce the carbon footprint of realistic food environments, but require coordinated implementation to maximize climate benefits and avoid unintended spillover effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u8089\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u6392\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u534f\u8c03\u5b9e\u65bd\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6c14\u5019\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5173\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5e72\u9884\u51cf\u5c11\u8089\u7c7b\u6444\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u591a\u79cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u4ea4\u53c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u745e\u58eb\u5927\u5b66\u6821\u56ed\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u98df\u5802\u5339\u914d\u83dc\u5355\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u7d20\u98df\u9910\u6298\u6263\u3001\u8089\u7c7b\u9644\u52a0\u8d39\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u8089\u7c7b\u9644\u52a0\u8d39\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5e72\u9884\u4f7f\u7d20\u98df\u9910\u8d2d\u4e70\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u63927.4%\u548c11.3%\uff1b\u9644\u52a0\u8d39\u6709\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u62b5\u6d88\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u996e\u98df\u4e60\u60ef\u4eba\u7fa4\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u8861\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u98df\u7269\u73af\u5883\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u534f\u8c03\u5b9e\u65bd\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6c14\u5019\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

Access patterns, revealed when operations are performed, can also be leveraged in inference attacks. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides access patterns by making client requests oblivious. However, existing protocols are still limited in supporting concurrent clients and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). We present MVP-ORAM, the first wait-free ORAM protocol that supports concurrent fail-prone clients. In contrast to previous works, MVP-ORAM avoids using trusted proxies, which require additional security assumptions, and concurrency control mechanisms based on inter-client communication or distributed locks, which limit overall throughput and the capability of tolerating faulty clients. Instead, MVP-ORAM enables clients to perform concurrent requests and merge conflicting updates as they happen, satisfying wait-freedom, i.e., clients make progress independently of the performance or failures of other clients. Since wait and collision freedom are fundamentally contradictory goals that cannot be achieved simultaneously in an asynchronous concurrent ORAM service, we define a weaker notion of obliviousness that depends on the application workload and number of concurrent clients, and prove MVP-ORAM is secure in practical scenarios where clients perform skewed block accesses. By being wait-free, MVP-ORAM can be seamlessly integrated into existing confidential BFT data stores, creating the first BFT ORAM construction. We implement MVP-ORAM on top of a confidential BFT data store and show our prototype can process hundreds of 4KB accesses per second in modern clouds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1\u6613\u6545\u969c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u65e0\u7b49\u5f85ORAM\u534f\u8baeMVP - ORAM\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709BFT\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0BFT ORAM\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ORAM\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5bb9\u9519\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u4efb\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9501\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u53d1\u8bf7\u6c42\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\u51b2\u7a81\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e94\u7528\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5f31\u9690\u79c1\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684MVP - ORAM\u539f\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6bcf\u79d2\u5904\u7406\u6570\u767e\u4e2a4KB\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "conclusion": "MVP - ORAM\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1\u6613\u6545\u969c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e0\u7b49\u5f85\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709BFT\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

However, achieving high-performance reinforcement learning (RL) training for LLMs on such computing resources remains challenging because the workflow involves multiple models and tasks with complex computation and data dependencies. In this paper, we present HetRL, a distributed system for efficient RL training in infrastructures with heterogeneous GPUs and networks. HetRL formulates the scheduling of RL training in heterogeneous environments as a constrained joint optimization problem and introduces a novel scheduling algorithm that (1) decomposes the complex search space with a multi-level search framework; and (2) allocates the search budget via successive halving. Our extensive evaluation, consuming 20,000 GPU-hours, shows that HetRL delivers up to 9.17x the throughput of state-of-the-art systems, and 3.17x on average, under various workloads and settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHetRL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784GPU\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0bLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0bRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u89e3\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u51cf\u534a\u5206\u914d\u641c\u7d22\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc720000 GPU - \u5c0f\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cHetRL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf9.17\u500d\uff0c\u5e73\u57473.17\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "HetRL\u80fd\u5728\u5f02\u6784GPU\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Each agent has to decide on one of a finite set of identical machines to get their job processed. In contrast to the common and exclusive focus on makespan minimization, we want the outcome to be fair under strategic considerations of the agents. Two natural properties are credibility, which ensures that the assignment is a Nash equilibrium and equality, requiring that agents with equal-weight jobs are assigned to machines of equal load. We combine these two with a hierarchy of fairness properties based on envy-freeness together with several relaxations based on the idea that envy seems more justified towards agents with a higher weight. We present a complete complexity landscape for satisfiability and decision versions of these properties, alone or in combination, and study them as structural constraints under makespan optimization.

Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments.

Unlike conventional RAG pipelines, which require costly construction and maintenance of full-scale vector databases that mirror the entire file system, SPAR employs a lightweight two-stage process: a semantic Metadata Index is first created, after which session-specific vector databases are dynamically generated on demand. This design reduces computational overhead while improving transparency, controllability, and relevance in retrieval. We provide a theoretical complexity analysis comparing SPAR with standard LLM-based RAG pipelines, demonstrating its computational advantages.

However, the complexity of the DLM training pipeline has hindered wider investigation. This paper presents the first independent, large-scale empirical study of DLMs. We build and release a complete, reproducible pipeline to systematically investigate the impact of key design choices. We evaluate dozens of configurations across multiple axes, including various data augmentation techniques (e.g., SpecAugment, dropout, mixup), different text-to-speech systems, and multiple decoding strategies. Our comparative analysis in a common subword vocabulary setting demonstrates that DLMs outperform traditional LMs, but only after a distinct compute tipping point. While LMs are more efficient at lower budgets, DLMs scale better with longer training, mirroring behaviors observed in diffusion language models. However, we observe smaller improvements than those reported in prior character-based work, which indicates that the DLM's performance is conditional on factors such as the vocabulary. Our analysis reveals that a key factor for improving performance is to condition the DLM on richer information from the ASR's hypothesis space, rather than just a single best guess. To this end, we introduce DLM-sum, a novel method for decoding from multiple ASR hypotheses, which consistently outperforms the previously proposed DSR decoding method. We believe our findings and public pipeline provide a crucial foundation for the community to better understand, improve, and build upon this promising class of models.

Typically, such data would need to be preprocessed -- by cleaning outliers and missing values -- before clustering could be performed. However, these preliminary steps rely on objective functions different from those used in the clustering stage. In this paper, we propose a unified model-based clustering approach that simultaneously handles atypical observations, missing values, and cluster-wise skewness within a single framework. Each cluster is modelled using a contaminated multivariate skew-normal distribution -- a convenient two-component mixture of multivariate skew-normal densities -- in which one component represents the main data (the \"bulk\") and the other captures potential outliers. From an inferential perspective, we implement and use a variant of the EM algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing approaches in both clustering accuracy and outlier detection, across low- and high-dimensional settings, even in the presence of substantial missingness. The method is further applied to the Cleveland Children's Sleep and Health Study (CCSHS), a dataset characterised by incomplete observations.

These trends blur the boundaries between the automotive sector and other industries. Unlike internal combustion engine (ICE) production, where mechanical capabilities dominated, competitiveness in electric vehicle (EV) production increasingly depends on expertise in electronics, batteries, and software. This study investigates whether and how firms' ability to leverage cross-industry diversification contributes to competitive advantage. We develop a country-level product space covering all industries and an industry-specific product space covering over 900 automotive components. This allows us to identify clusters of parts that are exported together, revealing shared manufacturing capabilities. Closeness centrality in the country-level product space, rather than simple proximity, is a strong predictor of where new comparative advantages are likely to emerge. We examine this relationship across industrial sectors to establish patterns of path dependency, diversification and capability formation, and then focus on the EV transition. New strengths in vehicles and aluminium products in the EU are expected to generate 5 and 4.6 times more EV-specific strengths, respectively, than other EV-relevant sectors over the next decade, compared to only 1.6 and 4.5 new strengths in already diversified China. Countries such as South Korea, China, the US and Canada show strong potential for diversification into EV-related products, while established producers in the EU are likely to come under pressure. These findings suggest that the success of the automotive transformation depends on regions' ability to mobilize existing industrial capabilities, particularly in sectors such as machinery and electronic equipment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f01\u4e1a\u8de8\u884c\u4e1a\u591a\u5143\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u56fd\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u56e0\u7535\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6982\u5ff5\u800c\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u4f01\u4e1a\u8de8\u884c\u4e1a\u591a\u5143\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c42\u9762\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5171\u540c\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u96f6\u90e8\u4ef6\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u4e0e\u65b0\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6b27\u76df\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u94dd\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u65b0\u4f18\u52bf\u9884\u8ba1\u5c06\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u76f8\u5173\u90e8\u95e8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u591a\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u4e2d\u56fd\u5df2\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u591a\u5143\u5316\uff1b\u97e9\u56fd\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u6709\u5411\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u76f8\u5173\u4ea7\u54c1\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6b27\u76df\u8001\u724c\u751f\u4ea7\u5546\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u538b\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5730\u533a\u8c03\u52a8\u73b0\u6709\u4ea7\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u673a\u68b0\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u884c\u4e1a\u3002"}}

Symbolic Data Analysis extends this framework to more complex structures, such as intervals and histograms, that express internal variability. We propose an extension of multiclass Fisher's Discriminant Analysis to interval-valued data, using Moore's interval arithmetic and the Mallows' distance. Fisher's objective function is generalised to consider simultaneously the contributions of the centres and the ranges of intervals and is numerically maximised. The resulting discriminant directions are then used to classify interval-valued observations.To support visual assessment, we adapt the class map, originally introduced for conventional data, to classifiers that assign labels through minimum distance rules. We also extend the silhouette plot to this setting and use stacked mosaic plots to complement the visual display of class assignments.

To make this decision is context-specific, but common goals are 1) computing efficiency: maximize the amount of workload processed by the edge, and 2) communication efficiency: minimize the communication cost between the cells and their assigned servers. We focus on practical scenarios where the user workload in each cell is unknown and time-varying, and so are the effective capacities of the servers. Our research problem is to choose a subset of candidate servers and assign them to the user cells such that the above goals are sustainably achieved under the above uncertainties.

This paper considers specifications given in the form of compositionally defined safe nets.\n  The paper discusses a novel concept of distributed place which implements the behaviour of an individual net place. It is shown that if distributed places cover a safe Petri net, then it is possible to delete some places without changing the behaviour. Crucially, the reduction is both static and local, making it computationally feasible in practice.\n  The resulting reduction technique is then applied to an algebra of safe Petri nets (boxes) derived compositionally from process (box) expressions. Though the original derivation can yield exponentially large boxes, prior research demonstrated that if a box expression does not involve cyclic behaviours, the exponential number of places can be reduced down to polynomial (quadratic).

By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics.

Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of \"regulatory blocks\": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance. Eight design strategies enable the blocks to evolve as fast as the models they police. A case study on emergent spoofing in multi-agent trading shows how the layered controls quarantine harmful behavior in real time while preserving innovation.

To address these challenges, we propose BLADE, a framework that enhances multi-behavior modeling while mitigating data sparsity. Specifically, to handle behavior heterogeneity, we introduce a dual item-behavior fusion architecture that incorporates behavior information at both the input and intermediate levels, enabling preference modeling from multiple perspectives. To mitigate data sparsity, we design three behavior-level data augmentation methods that operate directly on behavior sequences rather than core item sequences. These methods generate diverse augmented views while preserving the semantic consistency of item sequences. These augmented views further enhance representation learning and generalization via contrastive learning. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBLADE\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBLADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9879\u76ee - \u884c\u4e3a\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "BLADE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, despite recent advances on model checking hyperproperties, there is still a lack of higher-level specification languages that can effectively support software engineering practitioners in verifying properties of this class at early stages of system design.\n  Alloy is a lightweight formal method with a high-level specification language that is supported by automated analysis procedures, making it particularly well-suited for the verification of design models at early development stages. It does not natively support, however, the verification of hyperproperties.\n  This work proposes HyperPardinus, a new model finding procedure that extends Pardinus -- the temporal logic backend of the Alloy language -- to automatically verify hyperproperties over relational models by relying on existing low-level model checkers for hyperproperties. It then conservatively extends Alloy to support the specification and automatic verification of hyperproperties over design models, as well as the visualization of (counter-)examples at a higher-level of abstraction. Evaluation shows that our approach enables modeling and finding (counter-)examples for complex hyperproperties with alternating quantifiers, making it feasible to address relevant scenarios from the state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51faHyperPardinus\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Alloy\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e9\u671f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u8303\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e14Alloy\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperPardinus\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Alloy\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u540e\u7aefPardinus\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u5e95\u5c42\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u5b88\u6269\u5c55Alloy\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4ea4\u66ff\u91cf\u8bcd\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8d85\u5c5e\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u627e\u5230\uff08\u53cd\uff09\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A standard approach of mixture modeling is to assume that the mixture component takes a parametric kernel form, while the flexibility of the model can be obtained by using a large or possibly unbounded number of such parametric kernels. In many applications, making parametric assumptions on the latent subpopulation distributions may be unrealistic, which motivates the need for nonparametric modeling of the mixture components themselves. In this paper we study finite mixtures with nonparametric mixture components, using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach. In particular, it is assumed that the data population is generated according to a finite mixture of latent component distributions, where each component is endowed with a Bayesian nonparametric prior such as the Dirichlet process mixture. We present conditions under which the individual mixture component's distributions can be identified, and establish posterior contraction behavior for the data population's density, as well as densities of the latent mixture components. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior inference and demonstrate via simulation studies and real-world data illustrations that it is possible to efficiently learn complex distributions for the latent subpopulations. In theory, the posterior contraction rate of the component densities is nearly polynomial, which is a significant improvement over the logarithm convergence rate of estimating mixing measures via deconvolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u542b\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1MCMC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u7387\u8fd1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u505a\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u603b\u4f53\u7531\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\u8d4b\u4e88\u5982\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548MCMC\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5355\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u603b\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u7387\u8fd1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u7387\u76f8\u6bd4\u53cd\u5377\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Building on this tradition, Elkind et al.

A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text.

During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\\times$ and maintaining accuracy.

Traditionally, user reviews have served as a critical source of rich, contextual information for enhancing recommendation quality. However, as LLMs demonstrate an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text, this raises the question of whether explicit user reviews remain essential in the era of LLMs. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation of the evolving role of text reviews in recommendation by comparing deep learning methods and LLM approaches. Particularly, we conduct extensive experiments on eight public datasets with LLMs and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We further introduce a benchmarking evaluation framework for review-aware recommender systems, RAREval, to comprehensively assess the contribution of textual reviews to the recommendation performance of review-aware recommender systems. Our framework examines various scenarios, including the removal of some or all textual reviews, random distortion, as well as recommendation performance in data sparsity and cold-start user settings. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of functioning as effective review-aware recommendation engines, generally outperforming traditional deep learning approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by data sparsity and cold-start conditions. In addition, the removal of some or all textual reviews and random distortion does not necessarily lead to declines in recommendation accuracy. These findings motivate a rethinking of how user preference from text reviews can be more effectively leveraged.

Under preparation for journal submission", "summary": "Domain models are central to software engineering, as they enable a shared understanding, guide implementation, and support automated analyses and model-driven development. Yet, despite these benefits, practitioners often skip modeling because it is time-consuming and demands scarce expertise. We address this barrier by investigating whether open-weight large language models, adapted via instruction tuning, can generate high-quality BPMN process models directly from natural language descriptions in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving way. We introduce InstruBPM, a reproducible approach that prepares paired text-diagram data and instruction tunes an open source large language model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization for on-prem deployment. We evaluate the tuned model through complementary perspectives: (i) text/code similarity using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, (ii) structural fidelity using Relative Graph Edit Distance, (iii) guidelines conformance using external tool checks, and (iv) a small expert review. Using a curated subset of a multi-domain BPMN dataset, we compare the tuned model with untuned open-weight baselines and strong proprietary models under consistent prompting regimes. Our compact tuned model outperforms all baselines across sequence and structural metrics while requiring substantially fewer resources; guideline analysis and expert feedback further indicate that the generated diagrams largely follow BPMN best practices and are useful starting points that reduce modeling effort. Overall, instruction tuning improves structural accuracy and robustness compared to untuned baselines and reduces reliance on heavy prompt scaffolding.

Given a group $\\mathcal{G}$ with orbits $(\\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$, we analyse three canonical orbit kernels: namely the Gibbs $(G)$, Metropolis-Hastings $(M)$, and Barker $(B)$ kernels, as well as their multiplicative sandwiches $QPQ$ and the additive mixtures $\\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ where $Q\\in\\{G,M,B\\}$. We show that $M^t, B^t \\to G$ blockwise as $t \\to \\infty$ under suitable conditions, that the projection chains induced by $(\\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$ coincide for $GPG$ and $P$, and that orbit averaging never deteriorates the absolute spectral gap or asymptotic variance when $P$ is reversible. We give a direct and simple proof of Pythagorean identity under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, showing that $GPG$ arises naturally as an information projection of $P$ onto the set of $G$-invariant transition matrices. For a given $P$, we characterise the optimal choice of $G$ with a fixed number of orbits that minimises the one-step KL divergence to stationarity. Analogously, for a given $G$, we characterise the optimal choice of $P$ and give sufficient conditions under which $GPG = \u03a0$. We further show that alternating projections over multiple group actions converge at a rate governed by the singular values of an overlap matrix, and that in structured cases, this yields exact sampling where the number of group actions grows logarithmically with the size of the state space. Based on the theory, we propose two heuristics to tune $G$ in practice.

This study investigates how AI agents navigate network-effect games, where individual payoffs depend on peer participatio--a context underexplored in multi-agent systems despite its real-world prevalence. We introduce a novel workflow design using large language model (LLM)-based agents in repeated decision-making scenarios, systematically manipulating price trajectories (fixed, ascending, descending, random) and network-effect strength. Our key findings include: First, without historical data, agents fail to infer equilibrium.

This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace.

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets.

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5f15\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b092%\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e14\u65e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u572830\u4e2aPython\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408BM25\u7a00\u758f\u5339\u914d\u3001BGE\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u548cNeo4j\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6311\u6218\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc1\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f15\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u5927\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad814 - 18\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u572862%\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5021\u5bfc\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8692%\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e14\u65e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002"}}

This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother.

Planned Parenthood South Atlantic Supreme Court ruling and the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, have aimed to restrict or prohibit Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood Healthcare Centers (PPHCs) at both the state and national levels.

This analysis focuses on the distribution of Planned Parenthood clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which offer essential reproductive healthcare services including, but not limited to, abortions, birth control, HIV services, pregnancy testing and planning, STD testing and treatment, and cancer screenings. While expanded funding for FQHCs has been proposed as a solution, it fails to address the locational accessibility of Medicaid-funded health centers that provide sexual and reproductive care. To assess this issue, we analyze the proximity of data points representing California's PPHC and FQHC locations. Topological Data Analysis (TDA)-an approach that examines the shape and structure of data -- is used to detect disparities in reproductive and sexual healthcare coverage. To conduct data collection and visualization, we utilize R and Python. We apply an n-closest neighbor algorithm to examine distances between facilities and assess changes in travel time required to reach healthcare sites. We apply persistent homology to analyze current gaps across multiple scales in healthcare coverage and compare them to potential future gaps.

While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees.

However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies.

This study focuses on training-free recommendation, where no task-specific training is performed, and particularly on \\textit{training-free cold-start recommendation} (TFCSR), the more challenging case where the target user has no interactions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been explored as a promising solution, and numerous studies have been proposed.

We present the first controlled experiments that systematically evaluate these two approaches in the same setting. The results show that TEMs outperform LLM rerankers, and this trend holds not only in cold-start settings but also in warm-start settings with rich interactions.

Using the UNCDF Pacific Digital Economy dataset of 10,108 respondents, we apply a three-stage pipeline: descriptive profiling, interpretable machine learning, and scenario simulation to forecast outcomes of digital financial literacy interventions before deployment. Leveraging cross-sectional structural associations, the framework projects intervention scenarios as prioritization heuristics rather than causal estimates. A transparent linear regression model with R-squared of 95.9 identifies modifiable policy levers. Simulations indicate that foundational digital capabilities such as device access and expense tracking yield the highest projected gains, up to 5.5 percent, outperforming attitudinal nudges.

Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are a natural way to model data with Gaussian-distributed uncertainties.

To make the situation worse, classic approaches for visualizing the data uncertainties, like probabilistic marching cubes, are also computationally very expensive, especially for data of high resolutions. In this paper, we accelerate the level-crossing probability calculation efficiency on GPR models by subdividing the data spatially into a hierarchical data structure and only reconstructing values adaptively in the regions that have a non-zero probability. For each region, leveraging the known GPR kernel and the saved data observations, we propose a novel approach to efficiently calculate an upper bound for the level-crossing probability inside the region and use this upper bound to make the subdivision and reconstruction decisions.

Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5185\u6838\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlashFuser\u5229\u7528GPU\u5185\u6838\u95f4\u8fde\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u6838\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u5feb\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f7f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d7\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u6838\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u786c\u4ef6\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDSM\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u5efa\u6a21\u548cDSM\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA H100 GPU\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cFlashFuser\u51cf\u5c1158%\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8c03\u4f18\u5e93\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u5185\u6838\u52a0\u901f\u5206\u522b\u8fbe3.3\u500d\u548c4.1\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f1.24\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashFuser\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u7684\u5185\u6838\u95f4\u8fde\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u6838\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems.\n  In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u5171\u8bc6\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u94b1\u5305\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u63a8\u8fdb\u7535\u5b50\u6295\u7968\u3001\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u5168\u65e5\u5fd7\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u5176\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u94fe\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5171\u8bc6\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u94b1\u5305\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u53cc\u56e0\u7d20\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6295\u7968\u534f\u8bae\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u590d\u6295\u7968\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u5168\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5982\u5171\u8bc6\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u94b1\u5305\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u521b\u65b0\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u6295\u7968\u534f\u8bae\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u65e5\u5fd7\u6539\u5584\u3001\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Traditional log analysis techniques, including template-based and sequence-driven approaches, often lose important semantic information or struggle with ambiguous log patterns. To address this, we present EnrichLog, a training-free, entry-based anomaly detection framework that enriches raw log entries with both corpus-specific and sample-specific knowledge. EnrichLog incorporates contextual information, including historical examples and reasoning derived from the corpus, to enable more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. The framework leverages retrieval-augmented generation to integrate relevant contextual knowledge without requiring retraining. We evaluate EnrichLog on four large-scale system log benchmark datasets and compare it against five baseline methods.

This study presents a systematic approach to adapting e-commerce search results based on the current context. We start with basic methods and incrementally incorporate more contextual information and state-of-the-art techniques to improve the search outcomes. By applying this evolving contextual framework to items displayed on the search engine results page (SERP), we progressively align search outcomes more closely with the buyer's interests and current search intentions. Our findings demonstrate that this incremental enhancement, from simple heuristic autoregressive features to advanced sequence models, significantly improves ranker performance. The integration of contextual techniques enhances the performance of our production ranker, leading to improved search results in both offline and online A/B testing in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).

Existing anonymization methods, such as tabular transformations and graph perturbations, often overlook contextual dependencies among software metrics, leading to suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. Leveraging the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a cluster-guided anonymization technique that preserves contextual and statistical relationships within JIT datasets. Our method groups commits into feature-based clusters and employs an LLM to generate context-aware parameter configurations for each commit cluster, defining alpha-beta ratios and churn mixture distributions used for anonymization. Our evaluation on six projects (Cassandra, Flink, Groovy, Ignite, OpenStack, and Qt) shows that our LLM-based approach achieves privacy level 2 (IPR >= 80 percent), improving privacy by 18 to 25 percent over four state-of-the-art graph-based anonymization baselines while maintaining comparable F1 scores.

Crucially, we focus on differentiable sparsification, turning architecture search into an end-to-end optimization problem. Across function approximation benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, we demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy while discovering substantially smaller models.

Recent advances in modern machine learning have revealed a more complex pattern, double-descent, in which test loss, after peaking near the interpolation threshold, decreases again as model capacity continues to grow. While this behavior has been extensively analyzed in regression and classification, its manifestation in survival analysis remains unexplored. This study investigates double-descent in four representative survival models: DeepSurv, PC-Hazard, Nnet-Survival, and N-MTLR. We rigorously define interpolation and finite-norm interpolation, two key characteristics of loss-based models to understand double-descent. We then show the existence (or absence) of (finite-norm) interpolation of all four models.

Real-world mobility is highly non-stationary: abrupt turns, rapid speed changes, and unpredictable user behavior cause conventional predictors to drift, leading to mistimed or failed handovers. We propose a lightweight meta-continual forecasting framework that integrates a GRU-based predictor, Reptile meta-initialization for fast few-shot adaptation, and an EWMA residual detector that triggers compact online updates only when drift occurs. Evaluated on a reproducible GeoLife and DeepMIMO pipeline, our method achieves 4.46 m ADE and 7.79 m FDE in zero-shot settings, improves few-shot ADE to 3.71 m at 10-shot, and enables recovery from abrupt drift about 2 to 3 times faster than an offline GRU. When applied to downstream HO prediction, the approach improves F1 to 0.83 and AUROC to 0.90, with substantial reductions in missed-HO and ping-pong events.

The HDG method is implemented using GPU-tailored algorithms in which local element degrees of freedom are eliminated in parallel, and the globally condensed system is assembled directly on the device using dense-block operations. The global matrix is stored in a block format that reflects the natural HDG structure, enabling all iterative solver kernels to be executed with strided batched dense matrix-vector multiplications. This implementation avoids sparse data structures, increases arithmetic intensity, and sustains high memory throughput across a range of meshes and polynomial orders. The nonlinear solver combines Newton's method with preconditioned GMRES, integrating scalable preconditioners such as block-Jacobi, additive Schwarz domain decomposition, and polynomial smoothers. All preconditioners are implemented in batched form with architecture-aware optimizations--including dense linear algebra kernels, memory-coalesced vector operations, and shared-memory acceleration--to minimize memory traffic and maximize parallel occupancy.

Its core relies on a coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture that enables rapid candidate selection and precise semantic matching, achieving millisecond-level response over billion-scale corpora. This capability makes it essential not only in traditional search and recommendation scenarios but also in the emerging paradigm of generative recommendation driven by large language models, where semantic IDs-themselves a form of coarse-to-fine representation-play a foundational role. However, the widely adopted dual-tower encoding architecture introduces inherent challenges, primarily representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, which degrade matching accuracy, retrieval stability, and performance on long-tail queries. These issues are further magnified in semantic ID generation, ultimately limiting the performance ceiling of downstream generative models.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective framework named SCI comprising two synergistic modules: a symmetric representation alignment module that employs an innovative input-swapping mechanism to unify the dual-tower representation space without adding parameters, and an consistent indexing with dual-tower synergy module that redesigns retrieval paths using a dual-view indexing strategy to maintain consistency from training to inference. The framework is systematic, lightweight, and engineering-friendly, requiring minimal overhead while fully supporting billion-scale deployment.

This paper focuses on DRO with ambiguity sets defined via the Sinkhorn discrepancy: an entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, referred to as Sinkhorn DRO. Existing work primarily addresses Sinkhorn DRO from a dual perspective, leveraging its formulation as a conditional stochastic optimization problem, for which many stochastic gradient methods are applicable. However, the theoretical analyses of such methods often rely on the boundedness of the loss function, and it is indirect to obtain the worst-case distribution associated with Sinkhorn DRO. In contrast, we study Sinkhorn DRO from the primal perspective, by reformulating it as a bilevel program with several infinite-dimensional lower-level subproblems over probability space. This formulation enables us to simultaneously obtain the optimal robust decision and the worst-case distribution, which is valuable in practical settings, such as generating stress-test scenarios or designing robust learning algorithms. We propose both double-loop and single-loop sampling-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve this bilevel program.

We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast.

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDTSFormer\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u573a\u5ba2\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u57df\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u5757\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u573a\u5ba2\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u8d28\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTSFormer\uff0c\u542b\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u533a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u9891\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u533a\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u878d\u5408\u591a\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba2\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cDTSFormer\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u57df\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9891\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "DTSFormer\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u533a\u6a21\u5757\u53d1\u6325\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload.

Although Gaussian process models excel at capturing smooth nonlinear relationships, their stationarity assumptions limit their ability to adapt to sudden input-output variations. Existing nonstationary extensions, particularly those based on domain partitioning, often struggle with boundary inconsistencies, sensitivity to outliers, and scalability issues in higher-dimensional settings, leading to reduced predictive accuracy and unreliable parameter estimation.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Robust Local Gaussian Process (RLGP) model, a framework that integrates adaptive nearest-neighbor selection with a sparsity-driven robustification mechanism. Unlike existing methods, RLGP leverages an optimization-based mean-shift adjustment after a multivariate perspective transformation combined with local neighborhood modeling to mitigate the influence of outliers. This approach improves predictive accuracy near discontinuities while enhancing robustness to data heterogeneity.\n  Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that RLGP consistently delivers high predictive accuracy and maintains competitive computational efficiency, especially in scenarios with sharp transitions and complex response structures.

However, due to the sparsity of labels under semi-supervised learning, they have been found to exhibit biased performance on specific nodes. This kind of bias has been validated to correlate with topological structure and is considered as a bottleneck of GNNs' performance. Existing work focuses on the study of homogeneous GNNs and little attention has been given to topological bias in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). In this work, firstly, in order to distinguish distinct meta relations, we apply meta-weighting to the adjacency matrix of a heterogeneous graph. Based on the modified adjacency matrix, we leverage PageRank along with the node label information to construct a projection. The constructed projection effectively maps nodes to values that strongly correlated with model performance when using datasets both with and without intra-type connections, which demonstrates the universal existence of topological bias in HGNNs. To handle this bias, we propose a debiasing structure based on the difference in the mapped values of nodes and use it along with the original graph structure for contrastive learning.

However, most current systems treat all users as experts, leading to frustrating and inefficient interactions when users are unfamiliar with a domain. Systems that can adapt their conversational strategies to a user's knowledge level stand to offer a much more natural and effective experience. To make a step toward such adaptive systems, we introduce a new task: estimating user domain knowledge from conversations, enabling a CRS to better understand user needs and personalize interactions. A key obstacle to developing such adaptive systems is the lack of suitable data; to our knowledge, no existing dataset captures the conversational behaviors of users with varying levels of domain knowledge. Furthermore, in most dialogue collection protocols, users are free to express their own preferences, which tends to concentrate on popular items and well-known features, offering little insight into how novices explore or learn about unfamiliar features.

While machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the way they interpret data. Unlike natural language, source code meaning is defined less by token adjacency and more by complex, long-range, and structural relationships and dependencies. This limitation is especially pronounced for C and C++, where flatter syntactic hierarchies, pointer aliasing, multi-level indirection, typedef-based type obfuscation, and function-pointer calls hinder accurate static analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) that (i) generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG) that capture inter-functional dependencies for the entire program; (ii) has the ability to work on entire C and C++ projects comprising multiple files; (iii) works on both compilable and non-compilable code and (iv) produces a unified multi-view code representation using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), CFG and DFG. By preserving essential structural and semantic information, ATLAS provides a practical foundation for improving downstream SE and machine-learning-based program understanding.

We characterize a universal lower bound, the Limits-to-Learning Gap (LLG), quantifying the unavoidable discrepancy between a model's empirical fit and the population benchmark. Recovering the true population $R^2$, therefore, requires correcting observed predictive performance by this bound. Using a broad set of variables, including excess returns, yields, credit spreads, and valuation ratios, we find that the implied LLGs are large. This indicates that standard ML approaches can substantially understate true predictability in financial data.

However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability.

One of the critical research focus is the selection of prompt demonstrations. Current approaches typically employ retrieval models to select the top-K most semantically similar examples as demonstrations. However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) \u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u56db\u9879\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u5de5\u4f5c\u867d\u8868\u660eTRM\u5728ARC\u98ce\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd8\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9ARC Prize TRM\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u8c1c\u9898\u8eab\u4efd\u6d88\u878d\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eLlama 3 8B\u7684QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u96c6\u6210\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff1bTRM\u4e25\u683c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u9012\u5f52\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u5927\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6837\u672c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1bTRM\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/ronineume/BlossomRec.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236BlossomRec\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u77ed\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SRS\u4e2dTransformer\u7ed3\u6784\u968f\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1BlossomRec\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5206\u4e3a\u957f\u77ed\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u95e8\u63a7\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdbTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "BlossomRec\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

The method employs RealNVP-based flows to learn model-specific transport maps, enabling construction of both between-model and within-model proposals. Our framework provides accurate marginal likelihood estimates from the variational approximation. This facilitates efficient model comparison and proposal adaptation in RJMCMC.

Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency.

Existing MSMTR models typically consist of four information units: scenario-shared, scenario-specific, task-shared, and task-specific networks. These units interact to generate four types of relationship information flows, directed from scenario-shared or scenario-specific networks to task-shared or task-specific networks. However, these models face two main limitations: 1) They often rely on complex architectures, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE) networks, which increase the complexity of information fusion, model size, and training cost. 2) They extract all available information flows without filtering out irrelevant or even harmful content, introducing potential noise. Regarding these challenges, we propose a lightweight Automated Information Flow Selection (AutoIFS) framework for MSMTR. To tackle the first issue, AutoIFS incorporates low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to decouple the four information units, enabling more flexible and efficient information fusion with minimal parameter overhead. To address the second issue, AutoIFS introduces an information flow selection network that automatically filters out invalid scenario-task information flows based on model performance feedback. It employs a simple yet effective pruning function to eliminate useless information flows, thereby enhancing the impact of key relationships and improving model performance.

However, this growth is accompanied by increased attention from malicious actors, resulting in a significant rise in security threats to the Android ecosystem. Among these threats, the adoption of Anti-Runtime Analysis (ARA) techniques by malicious applications poses a serious challenge, as it hinders security professionals from effectively analyzing malicious behaviors using dynamic analysis tools. ARA technologies are designed to prevent the dynamic examination of applications, thus complicating efforts to ensure platform security.

However, this success remains largely empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we investigate the generalizability -- a theoretical measure of model performance in statistical learning -- of multivariate linear regression and LAEs. We first propose a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extending the earlier bound for single-output linear regression by Shalaeva et al., and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. We then show that LAEs, when evaluated under a relaxed mean squared error, can be interpreted as constrained multivariate linear regression models on bounded data, to which our bound adapts. Furthermore, we develop theoretical methods to improve the computational efficiency of optimizing the LAE bound, enabling its practical evaluation on large models and real-world datasets.

However, existing time series forecasting models in such setups often operate as black boxes, lacking mechanisms for explainable decision-making, which is a critical limitation when trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount in smart farming practices. This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment.

A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise.

However, subjective RiR assessment is unreliable, leading to suboptimal training stimuli or excessive fatigue. This paper introduces a novel system for real-time feedback on near-failure states (RiR $\\le$ 2) during resistance exercise using only a single wrist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate). Deployment on a Raspberry Pi 5 yielded an average inference latency of 112 ms, and on an iPhone 16 yielded 23.5 ms, confirming the feasibility for edge computation.

To address this challenging task, we propose Patchify, a simple yet effective patch-wise retrieval framework that offers high performance, scalability, and interpretability without requiring fine-tuning. Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines. Furthermore, we apply Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and highlight the importance of using informative features during compression, which significantly boosts performance.

Understanding the current state of practice of software engineering higher education can empower educators to critically assess their courses, fine-tune them by benchmarking against observed practices, and ultimately enhance their curricula. In this study, we aim to provide an encompassing analysis of higher education on software engineering by considering the higher educational offering of an entire European country, namely the Netherlands. We leverage a crowd-sourced analysis process by considering 10 Dutch universities and 207 university courses. The courses are analysed via knowledge areas adopted from the SWEBOK. The mapping process is refined via homogenisation and internal consistency improvement phases, and is followed by a data analysis phase. Given its fundamental nature, Construction and Programming is the most covered knowledge area at Bachelor level. Other knowledge areas are equally covered at Bachelor and Master level (e.g., software engineering models), while more advanced ones are almost exclusively covered at Master level. We identify three clusters of tightly coupled knowledge areas: (i) requirements, architecture, and design, (ii) testing, verification, and security, and (iii) process-oriented and DevOps topics. Dutch universities generally cover all knowledge areas uniformly, with minor deviations reflecting institutional research strengths. Our results highlight correlations among key knowledge areas and their potential for enhancing integrated learning. We also identify underrepresented areas, such as software engineering economics, which educators may consider including in curricula.

We introduce a framework for OOD detection that is simultaneously model aware and subspace aware, and that embeds variable prioritization directly into the detection step. The method uses the fitted predictor to construct localized neighborhoods around each test case that emphasize the features driving the model's learned relationship and downweight directions that are less relevant to prediction. It produces OOD scores without relying on global distance metrics or estimating the full feature density. The framework is applicable across outcome types, and in our implementation we use random forests, where the rule structure yields transparent neighborhoods and effective scoring.

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u9700\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u53ea\u9700\u5bf9\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5206\u79bb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u8005\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u9700\u8981\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u53ea\u9700\u5bf9\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6307\u6570\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHindsight\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHindsight\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u56db\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\u53ca\u53cd\u601d\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongMemEval\u548cLoCoMo\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHindsight\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7ebf\u53caGPT - 4o\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "Hindsight\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications.

This creates a fundamental bottleneck: these models inherit DFT's systematic failures for strongly correlated systems, leading to exploration biases and an inability to discover materials where DFT predictions are qualitatively incorrect. We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes. Our results demonstrate significant practical gains: a 3-5x improvement in successfully identifying potentially stable candidates in high-divergence regions (e.g., correlated oxides) compared to DFT-only baselines, while maintaining computational feasibility.

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference. Experimental results show that GCoDE can achieve up to 44.9x speedup and 98.2% energy reduction compared to existing approaches across diverse applications and system configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGCoDE\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3GNN\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "GNN\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709GNN\u8bbe\u5907 - \u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5c11\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGCoDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u901a\u4fe1\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u96c6\u6210\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "GCoDE\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe44.9\u500d\uff0c\u8282\u80fd98.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "GCoDE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3GNN\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data.

This includes classifying mixture distributions with cross-entropy loss with one and two-layer networks, and learning single and multi-index models with one and two-layer networks. When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned. We also show that the stochastic differential equation limits arising as fluctuations of the summary statistics around their ODE's fixed points are not universal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u7684ODE\u6781\u9650\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e58\u79ef\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u7684ODE\u6781\u9650\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u4e58\u79ef\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0b\u6709\u9650\u65cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e58\u79ef\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4e14\u524d\u4e24\u9636\u77e9\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5411\u91cf\u8db3\u591f\u5750\u6807\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u65f6\uff0cODE\u6781\u9650\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5750\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6ODE\u6781\u9650\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u56f4\u7ed5ODE\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6781\u9650\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0b\u7684ODE\u6781\u9650\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

However, across domains -- from artificial intelligence to economic institutions and biological evolution -- increasing intelligence often precipitates paradoxical degradation: systems become rigid, lose adaptability, and fail unexpectedly.\n  We identify \\emph{entropy collapse} as a universal dynamical failure mode arising when feedback amplification outpaces bounded novelty regeneration. Under minimal domain-agnostic assumptions, we show that intelligent systems undergo a sharp transition from high-entropy adaptive regimes to low-entropy collapsed regimes. Collapse is formalized as convergence toward a stable low-entropy manifold, not a zero-entropy state, implying a contraction of effective adaptive dimensionality rather than loss of activity or scale.\n  We analytically establish critical thresholds, dynamical irreversibility, and attractor structure and demonstrate universality across update mechanisms through minimal simulations. This framework unifies diverse phenomena -- model collapse in AI, institutional sclerosis in economics, and genetic bottlenecks in evolution -- as manifestations of the same underlying process.\n  By reframing collapse as a structural cost of intelligence, our results clarify why late-stage interventions systematically fail and motivate entropy-aware design principles for sustaining long-term adaptability in intelligent systems.\n  \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} entropy collapse; intelligent systems; feedback amplification; phase transitions; effective dimensionality; complex systems; model collapse; institutional sclerosis", "AI": {"tldr": "\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u81f4\u6096\u8bba\u6027\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u71b5\u574d\u7f29\u662f\u901a\u7528\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6837\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6096\u8bba\u6027\u9000\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u50f5\u5316\u3001\u5931\u53bb\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\u7b49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u71b5\u574d\u7f29\u662f\u901a\u7528\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u9ad8\u71b5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6001\u5230\u4f4e\u71b5\u574d\u7f29\u6001\u6709\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u574d\u7f29\u89c6\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u7ef4\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches face three critical challenges: (1) fixed-weight fusion strategies fail across cross modal noise and ambiguous queries, (2) temporal modeling struggles to capture coherent event sequences while penalizing unrealistic gaps, and (3) systems require manual modality selection, reducing usability. We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u589e\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3001\u65f6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u6355\u6349\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u6001\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ea7\u8054\u53cc\u5d4c\u5165\u7ba1\u9053\u7ed3\u5408BEIT - 3\u548cSigLIP\u5e76\u7531BLIP - 2\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u65f6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u7528\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u60e9\u7f5a\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9699\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Agent\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u65f6\u523b\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Low-rank bottleneck architectures offer a promising solution to significantly reduce the training time and memory footprint with minimum impact on accuracy.

To address this limitation, we propose BOOST, an efficient training framework tailored for large-scale low-rank bottleneck architectures.

We test the robustness of these claims. First, we reproduce Anthropic's multi-turn \"emergent introspection\" result on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, finding that the model identifies and names the injected concept 20 percent of the time under Anthropic's original pipeline, exactly matching their reported numbers and thus showing that introspection is not exclusive to very large or capable models. Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

Studies 3, 4, and 5 confirmed this higher-order model, demonstrated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, strong factor loadings, sex invariance, and convergent and discriminant validity. Studies 3 and 4 further revealed that critical thinking in AI use was positively associated with openness, extraversion, positive trait affect, and frequency of AI use. Lastly, Study 6 demonstrated criterion validity of the scale, with higher critical thinking in AI use scores predicting more frequent and diverse verification strategies, greater veracity-judgement accuracy in a novel and naturalistic ChatGPT-powered fact-checking task, and deeper reflection about responsible AI. Taken together, the current work clarifies why and how people exercise oversight over generative AI outputs and provides a validated scale and ecologically grounded task paradigm to support theory testing, cross-group, and longitudinal research on critical engagement with generative AI outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8613\u9879AI\u4f7f\u7528\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u91cf\u8868\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u5176\u7f51\u7edc\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u9700\u7528\u6237\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76AI\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u516d\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff08N = 1365\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u91cf\u8868\u9879\u76ee\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56e0\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u8868\u5177\u4e09\u56e0\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u826f\u597d\u4fe1\u6548\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14AI\u4f7f\u7528\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u7b49\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f97\u5206\u9ad8\u8005\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9610\u660e\u4eba\u4eec\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u8868\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, sparse annotation and label noise in the training data make it challenging to train or fine-tune such retrieval models. Although existing works have attempted to mitigate these problems by incorporating modified loss functions or data cleaning, these approaches either require some hyperparameters to tune during training or add substantial complexity to the training setup. In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise.

Using the EU AI Act Annex IV and the Stanford Transparency Index as baselines, we developed a weighted transparency framework with 8 sections and 23 subsections that prioritizes safety-critical disclosures (Safety Evaluation: 25%, Critical Risk: 20%) over technical specifications. We implemented an automated multi-agent pipeline that extracts documentation from public sources and scores completeness through LLM-based consensus. Evaluating 50 models across vision, multimodal, open-source, and closed-source systems cost less than $3 in total and revealed systematic gaps. Frontier labs (xAI, Microsoft, Anthropic) achieve approximately 80% compliance, while most providers fall below 60%. Safety-critical categories show the largest deficits: deception behaviors, hallucinations, and child safety evaluations account for 148, 124, and 116 aggregate points lost, respectively, across all evaluated models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u6863\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u6863\u540e\u5f00\u53d1\u52a0\u6743\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u8bc4\u4f3050\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3AI\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u6863\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u58f0\u660e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u7248\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u548c100\u4e2aHugging Face\u6a21\u578b\u5361\u7247\uff1b\u4ee5EU AI Act Annex IV\u548cStanford Transparency Index\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u52a0\u6743\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5b9e\u65bd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u6863\u5e76\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3050\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u82b1\u8d39\u4e0d\u52303\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u6cbf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ea680%\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4f4e\u4e8e60%\uff1b\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7c7b\u522b\u7f3a\u5931\u6700\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u6863\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7c7b\u522b\u62ab\u9732\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u6863\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6KAML\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ADM\u7b56\u7565\u3001HKE\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MTL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dCVR\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKAML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ADM\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHKE\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u884c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cKAML\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709MTL\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "KAML\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8CVR\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Using this benchmark, we conduct the first systematic study of LLMs and propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that assesses actor correctness, name accuracy, path fidelity, and behavioral coverage. The results show that while LLMs can partially reconstruct system functionality, their performance varies significantly across projects, with particularly noticeable shortcomings in domain-specific and multi-module systems.

While NTK-based methods achieve faster convergence, transmitting full Jacobian matrices is impractical for bandwidth-constrained edge networks. We propose SPARK, synergistically integrating random projection-based Jacobian compression, stage-wise annealed distillation, and Nesterov momentum acceleration. Random projections compress Jacobians while preserving spectral properties essential for convergence. Stage-wise annealed distillation transitions from pure NTK evolution to neighbor-regularized learning, counteracting compression noise.

Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling higher-order interactions and cross-modal alignment in heterogeneous knowledge graphs.

However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks.

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART.

Text-to-image systems such as DALL.E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney can now convert ideas into visuals within seconds, but they also present a dual-use dilemma, raising critical ethical concerns: amplifying societal biases, producing high-fidelity disinformation, and violating intellectual property. This paper introduces SafeGen, a framework that embeds ethical safeguards directly into the text-to-image generation pipeline, grounding its design in established principles for Trustworthy AI. SafeGen integrates two complementary components: BGE-M3, a fine-tuned text classifier that filters harmful or misleading prompts, and Hyper-SD, an optimized diffusion model that produces high fidelity, semantically aligned images. Built on a curated multilingual (English- Vietnamese) dataset and a fairness-aware training process, SafeGen demonstrates that creative freedom and ethical responsibility can be reconciled within a single workflow.

Yet, much of the phenomenology of training remains ill understood. We focus on three seemingly disparate observations: the occurrence of phase transitions reminiscent of statistical physics, the ubiquity of saddle points, and phenomenon of mode connectivity relevant for model merging. We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, fast, and easy to implement algorithm that uses the L2 regularizer as a tool to probe the geometry of error landscapes. We apply it to confirm mode connectivity in DNNs trained on the MNIST dataset by efficiently finding paths that connect global minima. We then show numerically that saddle points induce transitions between models that encode distinct digit classes.

These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states.

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices.

Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aSEDULity\u7684PoL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3ML\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "PoW\u80fd\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80PoL\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6216\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684PoL\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6a21\u677f\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u6c42\u89e3\u4f46\u6613\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6709\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3PoW\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3ML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u7406\u77ff\u5de5\u53d7\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SEDULity\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Aesthetic concepts are inherently abstract and open-ended, and multimodal artwork annotations are scarce. We introduce KidsArtBench, a new benchmark of over 1k children's artworks (ages 5-15) annotated by 12 expert educators across 9 rubric-aligned dimensions, together with expert comments for feedback. Unlike prior aesthetic datasets that provide single scalar scores on adult imagery, KidsArtBench targets children's artwork and pairs multi-dimensional annotations with comment supervision to enable both ordinal assessment and formative feedback. Building on this resource, we propose an attribute-specific multi-LoRA approach, where each attribute corresponds to a distinct evaluation dimension (e.g., Realism, Imagination) in the scoring rubric, with Regression-Aware Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to align predictions with ordinal scales. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our method increases correlation from 0.468 to 0.653, with the largest gains on perceptual dimensions and narrowed gaps on higher-order attributes.

Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance.

Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems. Overall, our findings highlight the value of ecological optimality principles for advancing interpretable and adaptive AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u914d\u5907\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u89c5\u98df\u8005\u81ea\u7136\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u7b26\u5408\u8fb9\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u5b9a\u7406\uff08MVT\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u751f\u6001\u6700\u4f18\u539f\u5219\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4fc3\u4f7f\u751f\u7269\u89c5\u98df\u8005\u505a\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u6591\u5757\u89c5\u98df\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u83b7\u53d6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7b80\u7ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u8bb8\u591a\u751f\u7269\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u9884\u671f\u80fd\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u6591\u5757\u79bb\u5f00\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6001\u6700\u4f18\u539f\u5219\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system -- SigTIme -- with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation.

This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors.

However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: \"You are being probed for {concept}\". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks.

Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the Predictor-Corrector mechanism consistently improves the performance compared to Predictor alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b - \u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b - \u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u53d7\u63a7\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b - \u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b - \u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3SQL\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eSQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u6e21\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165GAI\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3SQL\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Traditional information criteria, such as the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Mallows's $\\mathit{C_p}$, are valuable tools for identifying optimal models. However, the exponential increase in candidate models with each additional model parameter renders the evaluation of these criteria for all models -- a strategy known as exhaustive, or brute-force, searches -- computationally prohibitive. Consequently, heuristic approaches like stepwise regression are commonly employed, albeit without guarantees of finding the globally-optimal model.\n  In this study, we challenge the prevailing notion that non-monotonicity in information criteria precludes bounds on the search space. We introduce a simple but novel bound that enables the development of branch-and-bound algorithms tailored for these non-monotonic functions. We demonstrate that our approach guarantees identification of the optimal model(s) across diverse model classes, sizes, and applications, often with orders of magnitude computational speedups. For instance, in one previously-published model selection task involving $2^{32}$ (approximately 4 billion) candidate models, our method achieves a computational speedup exceeding 6,000.

Offline benchmarks using static, single path annotated datasets unfairly penalize valid alternative actions, while online benchmarks suffer from poor scalability and reproducibility due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of live evaluation. Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we present MobiBench, the first modular and multi path aware offline benchmarking framework for mobile GUI agents that enables high fidelity, scalable, and reproducible evaluation entirely in offline settings. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiBench achieves 94.72 percent agreement with human evaluators, on par with carefully engineered online benchmarks, while preserving the scalability and reproducibility of static offline benchmarks.

The Data-Light SE Challenge", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested?\n  The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization).\n  Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.\n  For the purposes of open science, our scripts and data are online at https://github.com/KKGanguly/NEO .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u8fd190%\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cCPU\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u80fd\u8fbe\u8fd190%\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u4e9b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Various uncertainty measures have been proposed for this purpose, typically claiming superiority over other measures. In this paper, we argue that there is no single best measure. Instead, uncertainty quantification should be tailored to the specific application. To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks.

Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aMemoria\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u9700\u7ef4\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemoria\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7ea7\u6458\u8981\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea6\u675f\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u77ed\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "Memoria\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728Web\u73af\u5883\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fdc\u89c1\u4e14\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faWebOperator\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728Web\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fdc\u89c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u9006\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645Web\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165WebOperator\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u4f73\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u5019\u9009\u5e76\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u5728WebArena\u548cWebVoyager\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86WebOperator\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728WebArena\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528gpt - 4o\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8654.6%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6218\u7565\u8fdc\u89c1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62).

This paper proposes a formal framework for quantifying trust in third-party software dependencies that is both formally checkable - formalized in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) - while at the same time incorporating human factors, like the number of downloads, authors, and other metadata that are commonly used to identify trustworthy software in practice. We use data from both software analysis tools and metadata to build a first-order relational model of software dependencies; to obtain an overall \"trust cost\" combining these factors, we propose a formalization based on the minimum trust problem which asks for the minimum cost of a set of assumptions which can be used to prove that the code is safe. We implement these ideas in Cargo Sherlock, targeted for Rust libraries (crates), incorporating a list of candidate assumptions motivated by quantifiable trust metrics identified in prior work. Our evaluation shows that Cargo Sherlock can be used to identify synthetically generated supply chain attacks and known incidents involving typosquatted and poorly AI-maintained crates, and that its performance scales to Rust crates with many dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5316\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5728Rust\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0Cargo Sherlock\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6574\u4f53\u201c\u4fe1\u4efb\u6210\u672c\u201d\uff0c\u5728Cargo Sherlock\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "Cargo Sherlock\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6253\u5b57\u8bc8\u9a97\u548cAI\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0d\u826f\u7684 crate \u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9879\u7684 Rust crate\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

In response, automated game testing has been viewed as a promising solution to cope with this demanding release cadence.

To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft.

We introduce a behaviorally realistic demographic based data augmentation strategy that expands a small QoE dataset six fold by modeling varying user sensitivities to streaming impairments such as rebuffering, bitrate variation, and quality degradation. Using the augmented dataset, we evaluate a comprehensive set of classical machine learning models alongside advanced deep learning architectures, including an attention-based MLP and TabNet.\n  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy across RMSE, MAE, and R metrics compared to baseline models. Among all evaluated approaches, TabNet achieves the strongest performance, benefiting from its inherent feature selection and attention mechanisms.

These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment.

Our approach partitions the data into $m$ disjoint subsets and formulates a joint optimization problem based on robust aggregation principles. A key insight is that the full posterior distribution is equivalent to the minimizer of the mean Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the $m$-powered local posterior distributions. To enhance robustness, we replace the mean KL divergence with a min-max median formulation. The min-max formulation not only ensures consistency between the KL minimizer and the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) maximizer but also facilitates the establishment of improved statistical rates for the mean of variational posterior. We observe a notable discrepancy in the $m$-powered marginal log likelihood function contingent on the presence of local latent variables. To address this, we treat these two scenarios separately to guarantee the consistency of the aggregated variational posterior. Specifically, when local latent variables are present, we introduce an aggregate-and-rescale strategy. Theoretically, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of our proposed posterior, incorporating a refined analysis of Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorem to accommodate a diverging number of subsets $m$. Our findings indicate that the two-stage approach yields a smaller approximation error compared to directly aggregating the $m$-powered local posteriors. Furthermore, we establish a nearly optimal statistical rate for the mean of the proposed posterior, advancing existing theories related to min-max median estimators.

My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly.

Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.\n  This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdSYSSPEC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210SPECFS\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u89c4\u8303\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u7cca\u800c\u672a\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5065\u6f14\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SYSSPEC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u539f\u5219\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u7cca\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u89c4\u8303\u63cf\u8ff0\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1DAG\u7ed3\u6784\u8865\u4e01\u7ba1\u7406\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u542b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684SPECFS\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u56de\u5f52\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210Ext4\u768410\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u8303\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that wrapping agent actions in atomic transactions can guarantee safety with acceptable latency, outperforming the heavy initialization overhead of containers or the interactive friction of commercial CLIs. We validated this approach by deploying the Minimind-MoE LLM served via nano-vllm on a custom Proxmox-based testbed utilizing EVPN/VXLAN isolation. Experimental results demonstrate a 100\\% interception rate for high-risk commands and a 100\\% success rate in rolling back failed states.

Current approaches either maintain unlimited memory stores, leading to computational intractability and privacy concerns, or employ simplistic forgetting mechanisms that compromise agent coherence and functionality. This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments.

We aim to make such sampling feasible for large surveys while preserving calibration, that is, high uncertainty in less illuminated areas. Our approach couples diffusion-based posterior sampling with simultaneous-source FWI data. At each diffusion noise level, a network predicts a clean velocity model. We then apply a stochastic refinement step in model space using Langevin dynamics under the wave-equation likelihood and reintroduce noise to decouple successive levels before proceeding. Simultaneous-source batches reduce forward and adjoint solves approximately in proportion to the supergather size, while an unconditional diffusion prior trained on velocity patches and volumes helps suppress source-related numerical artefacts. We evaluate the method on three 2D synthetic datasets (SEG/EAGE Overthrust, SEG/EAGE Salt, SEAM Arid), a 2D field line, and a 3D upscaling study. Relative to a particle-based variational baseline, namely Stein variational gradient descent without a learned prior and with single-source (non-simultaneous-source) FWI, our sampler achieves lower model error and better data fit at a substantially reduced computational cost.

Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06ILP\u7cfb\u7edfPyGol\u4e0eSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668Z3\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f52\u7eb3\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u8c13\u8bcd\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u89c4\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfILP\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06PyGol\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u53e5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u80cc\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65e0\u91cf\u8bcd\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u503c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559ILP\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u5757\u5316SMT - ILP\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316SMT - ILP\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u6570\u503cILP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u62d3\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion.

However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a \"policy collapse\" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u5b58\u5728'\u7b56\u7565\u5d29\u6e83'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faM - GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u548cIQR\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728'\u7b56\u7565\u5d29\u6e83'\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u6eda\u52a8\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM - GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u52a8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56db\u5206\u4f4d\u8ddd\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fee\u526a\u4f4e\u71b5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cM - GRPO\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cIQR\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions.

This work introduces a novel framework for constructing cycle communities through two complementary approaches. First, a dendrogram-based methodology leverages merge-tree algorithms to construct hierarchical representations of homology classes from persistence intervals. The Wasserstein distance on merge trees is introduced as a metric for comparing dendrograms, establishing connections to hierarchical clustering frameworks. Through simulation studies, the discriminative power of dendrogram representations for identifying cycle communities is demonstrated. Second, an extension of Stratified Gradient Sampling simultaneously learns multiple filter functions that yield cycle barycenter functions capable of faithfully reconstructing distinct sets of cycles. The set of cycles each filter function can reconstruct constitutes cycle communities that are non-overlapping and partition the space of all cycles. Together, these approaches transform the problem of cycle matching into both a hierarchical clustering and topological optimization framework, providing principled methods to identify similar topological structures both within and across groups of topological objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u5faa\u73af\u793e\u533a\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u72b6\u56fe\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u68af\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5faa\u73af\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u8c61\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5faa\u73af\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4e00\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u72b6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u5e76\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u6301\u4e45\u533a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u8c03\u7c7b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u8f83\u6811\u72b6\u56fe\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u5c42\u68af\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u4e2a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u51fd\u6570\u5f97\u5230\u5faa\u73af\u91cd\u5fc3\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u5faa\u73af\u793e\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u6811\u72b6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u8bc6\u522b\u5faa\u73af\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u793e\u533a\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u4e14\u5212\u5206\u6240\u6709\u5faa\u73af\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5faa\u73af\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ec4\u5185\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Code available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/BaRISTA", "summary": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u533a\u57df\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8c03\u6574\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u533a\u57df\u9885\u5185\u8bb0\u5f55\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u8111\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u63a9\u7801\u6f5c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee4\u724c\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u8c03\u6574\u4ee4\u724c\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\uff1b\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u4ee4\u724c\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee4\u724c\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u591a\u533a\u57df\u4eba\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoDeQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u526a\u679d\u548c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u53ef\u5728ImageNet\u7684ResNet - 18\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8054\u5408\u526a\u679d - \u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u5916\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5de5\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6b7b\u533a\u7b49\u6548\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6b7b\u533a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faCoDeQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5728ImageNet\u7684ResNet - 18\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u7ea65%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CoDeQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u526a\u679d - \u91cf\u5316\u3002"}}

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs.

To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone.

HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon.

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies.

Our implementation, benchmarked on the QM9 and QMe14S datasets, achieves new state-of-the-art performance in property alignment for de novo molecular generation.

Addressing this challenge, this work presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework that combines autoencoder-based transfer learning with a newly developed Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) strategy to achieve uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion under extreme data scarcity. The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data.

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting.

In this work, we introduce EEG-DLite, a data distillation framework that enables more efficient pre-training by selectively removing noisy and redundant samples from large EEG datasets. EEG-DLite begins by encoding EEG segments into compact latent representations using a self-supervised autoencoder, allowing sample selection to be performed efficiently and with reduced sensitivity to noise. Based on these representations, EEG-DLite filters out outliers and minimizes redundancy, resulting in a smaller yet informative subset that retains the diversity essential for effective foundation model training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training on only 5 percent of a 2,500-hour dataset curated with EEG-DLite yields performance comparable to, and in some cases better than, training on the full dataset across multiple downstream tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of pre-training data distillation in the context of EEG foundation models.

Classical analyses of SGD provide convergence guarantees in expectation or at a fixed horizon, but offer no statistically valid way to assess, at an arbitrary time, how close the current iterate is to the optimum. We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-\u03b1$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes.

However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

However, the standard DPO formulation, in which both the chosen and rejected responses are generated by the same policy, suffers from a weak learning signal because the two responses often share similar errors and exhibit small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family.

Effective targeting depends on accurately separating customers with positive versus negative treatment effects. We propose an approach to estimate the conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) of marketing actions that aligns their estimation with the firm's profit objective. The method recognizes that, for many customers, treatment effects are so extreme that additional accuracy is unlikely to change the recommended actions. However, accuracy matters near the decision boundary, as small errors can alter targeting decisions. By modifying the firm's objective function in the standard profit maximization problem, our method yields a near-optimal targeting policy while simultaneously estimating CATEs. This introduces a new perspective on CATE estimation, reframing it as a problem of profit optimization rather than prediction accuracy.

However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer.

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up.

Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process.

While several studies have explored how LLMs can generate or solve optimization models, far less is understood about what these models actually learn regarding problem structure or algorithmic behavior. This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing.

We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants.

While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Motivated by the SEARCH Universal HIV Test-and-Treat Trial (2013-2017), we tell our story of developing, evaluating, and implementing a machine learning-based approach for covariate adjustment. We provide the rationale for as well as the practical concerns with such an approach for estimating marginal effects. Using schematics, we illustrate our procedure: targeted machine learning estimation (TMLE) with Adaptive Pre-specification. Briefly, sample-splitting is used to data-adaptively select the combination of estimators of the outcome regression (i.e., the conditional expectation of the outcome given the trial arm and covariates) and known propensity score (i.e., the conditional probability of being randomized to the intervention given the covariates) that minimizes the cross-validated variance estimate and, thereby, maximizes empirical efficiency.

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

Here, we report an advanced optimization framework that combines deep learning and evolutionary algorithms to significantly improve both the design and performance of chiral photonic nanostructures. Building on previous work utilizing a three-layer perceptron reinforced learning and stochastic evolutionary algorithm with decaying changes and mass extinction for chiral photonic optimization, our study introduces a refined pipeline featuring a two-output neural network architecture to reduce the trade-off between high chiral dichroism (CD) and reflectivity. Additionally, we use an improved fitness function, and efficient data augmentation techniques. A comparative analysis between a neural network (NN)-based approach and a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for structures of different interface pattern depth, material combinations, and geometric complexity. We demonstrate a twice higher CD and the impact of both the corner number and the refractive index contrast at the example of a GaP/air and PMMA/air metasurface as a result of superior optimization performance. Additionally, a substantial increase in the number of structures explored within limited computational resources is highlighted, with tailored spectral reflectivity suggested by our electromagnetic simulations, paving the way for chiral mirrors applicable to polarization-selective light-matter interaction studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u624b\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8CD\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u7ed3\u6784\u63a2\u7d22\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5149\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u624b\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8f93\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4NN\u548cGA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u500d\u9ad8\u7684CD\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u591a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7535\u78c1\u6a21\u62df\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9a\u5236\u5149\u8c31\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u632f\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5149 - \u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u624b\u6027\u955c\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In clinical applications, a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process provides physicians with strong evidence to support decision-making. While reinforcement learning has effectively enhanced reasoning performance in medical contexts, the clinical reliability of these reasoning processes remains limited because their accuracy and validity are often overlooked during training. To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality.

Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u7ecf\u5178\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u77e5\u56e0\u679c\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u6240\u6709\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u679c\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u4e8c\u5143\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u628a\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u5e72\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u53cc\u5411\u8054\u5408\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u5411\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u7ecf\u5178\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e8c\u5143\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90e8\u5206\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u4e5f\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures.

In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none. The paper situates these dynamics within emerging clinical reports, develops a phenomenological account of how they unfold, and argues that current engagement-optimised design choices exacerbate the risk.

We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches.

In this work, we present a novel knowledge-guided ViT-based Masked Autoencoder that embeds scientific domain knowledge within the self-supervised reconstruction process. Instead of relying solely on data-driven optimization, our proposed approach incorporates the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) as a physical constraint and physically-based Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), ensuring that learned representations adhere to known structural relationships between observed signals and their latent components.

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5c16\u5cf0\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230LFP\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LFP\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LFP\u4fe1\u53f7\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u805a\u5408\u7279\u6027\u7ed9\u5efa\u6a21\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u7279\u5b9a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u795e\u7ecf\u6807\u8bb0\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u76ee\u6807\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u5c16\u5cf0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u5b66\u751fLFP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u5c16\u5cf0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684LFP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4f1a\u8bdd\u548c\u591a\u4f1a\u8bddLFP\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u84b8\u998f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5c16\u5cf0\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u51c6\u786eLFP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding.

TM, similar to previous paradigms, gradually transforms noise samples to data samples, however it uses a second ``internal'' generative model to implement the transition steps, making the transitions more expressive compared to diffusion and flow models. To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics.

We present Graph of Molecule Substructures (GoMS), a novel architecture that explicitly models the interactions and spatial arrangements between molecular substructures. Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements. Our approach shows particular promise for materials science applications involving complex molecules where properties emerge from the interplay between multiple functional units.

This study extends temporal prediction analysis to Week 20 (50% of course duration), comparing Decision Tree and Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) models across six temporal snapshots. Our analysis reveals that different performance metrics matter at different intervention stages: high recall is critical for early intervention (Weeks 2-4), while balanced precision-recall is important for mid-course resource allocation (Weeks 8-16), and high precision becomes paramount in later stages (Week 20). We demonstrate that static demographic features dominate predictions (68% importance), enabling assessment-free early prediction. The LSTM model achieves 97% recall at Week 2, making it ideal for early intervention, while Decision Tree provides stable balanced performance (78% accuracy) during mid-course. By Week 20, both models converge to similar recall (68%), but LSTM achieves higher precision (90% vs 86%).

Although the current allocation policy was recently revised in 2018, a major concern is that it does not adequately take into account pretransplant and post-transplant mortality. In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.\n  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance. Our simulator also allows us to evaluate the effect of critical, and often unexplored, factors in the allocation, such as geographic proximity and the tendency to reject offers by the transplant centers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5fc3\u810f\u79fb\u690d\u4f9b\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u653f\u7b56\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u72b6\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u5982\u77ed\u89c6\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4f9b\u4f53\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5fc3\u810f\u79fb\u690d\u4f9b\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u653f\u7b56\u57282018\u5e74\u4fee\u8ba2\u540e\u4ecd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u79fb\u690d\u524d\u540e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528UNOS\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u529b\u503c\u5236\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5206\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4f9b\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u72b6\u653f\u7b56\u8fdc\u4e0d\u5982\u77ed\u89c6\u653f\u7b56\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u5206\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u653f\u7b56\uff1b\u5206\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u4f9b\u4f53\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u7406\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u548c\u79fb\u690d\u4e2d\u5fc3\u62d2\u7edd\u63d0\u8bae\u503e\u5411\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u653f\u7b56\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5fc3\u810f\u79fb\u690d\u4f9b\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Khmer is a language spoken daily by over 17 million people in Cambodia, receiving little attention in the development of document AI tools. The lack of dedicated resources is particularly acute for business documents, which are critical for both public administration and private enterprise. To address this gap, we present \\textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols.

Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning.

Small shifts in the behavior of these users are often sufficient to propagate widely throughout the network. A similar phenomenon occurs during neural network fine tuning. Conventional fine tuning of convolutional neural networks typically adds a new linear classification layer on top of a large pre trained model. Instead we argue that improved adaptation can be achieved by first pruning the network to retain only the most important neurons and then performing fine tuning.\n  We propose a graph theory based method for pruning neural networks that is designed to improve fine tuning performance. In this method each neuron is represented as a node and edges encode similarity between neurons. Neurons are pruned based on importance scores computed using eigenvector centrality. The resulting pruned network is then fine tuned using only the most central neurons. We evaluate the proposed method on VGGNet EfficientNet and ResNet models using the TF Flowers Caltech one zero one and Oxford Flowers one zero two datasets.

No claims of quantum advantage", "summary": "This paper presents an exploratory, simulator-based proof of concept investigating whether differentiable energy terms derived from parameterized quantum circuits can serve as auxiliary regularization signals in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We augment the Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) generator objective with a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)-inspired energy term computed from class-specific Ising Hamiltonians using Qiskit's EstimatorQNN and TorchConnector.\n  Important limitations: All experiments run on a noiseless statevector simulator with only 4 qubits, use a deliberately simple Hamiltonian parameterization, and lack ablation studies comparing against equivalent classical biases. The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.\n  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96.

This report describes the systemic environmental risks of artificial intelligence, in particular, moving beyond direct impacts such as energy and water usage. Systemic environmental risks of AI are emergent, cross-sector harms to climate, biodiversity, freshwater, and broader socioecological systems that arise primarily from AI's integration into social, economic, and physical infrastructures, rather than its direct resource use, and that propagate through feedbacks, yielding nonlinear, inequitable, and potentially irreversible impacts. While these risks are emergent and quantification is uncertain, this report aims to provide an overview of systemic environmental risks. Drawing on a narrative literature review, we propose a three-level framework that operationalizes systemic risk analysis. The framework identifies the structural conditions that shape AI development, the risk amplification mechanisms that propagate environmental harm, and the impacts that manifest as observable ecological and social consequences.

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization.

Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This work introduces a novel paradigm that uses surrogate models to create simpler, faster, and more flexible approximations of these dynamics.

Our experiments on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation demonstrate that these surrogates achieve competitive performance while offering dramatic improvements in efficiency and interpretability.

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fa\u5b9aTransformer\u9aa8\u5e72\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u9aa8\u5e72\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u628a\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u770b\u4f5c\u5916\u90e8\u6ce8\u5165\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u5316Transformer\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u9aa8\u5e72\u53ef\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u957f\u5ea6/\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u8861\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u5207\u6362\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e3b\u5f20\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

Cities play a critical role in meeting IPCC targets, generating 75% of global energy-related GHG emissions. In Houston, Texas, on-road transportation represents 48% of baseline emissions in the Climate Action Plan (CAP). To reach net-zero by 2050, the CAP targets a 70% emissions reduction from a 2014 baseline, offset by 30% renewable energy. This goal is challenging because Houston is low-density and auto-dependent, with 89% of on-road emissions from cars and small trucks and limited public transit usage. Socio-economic disparities further constrain Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption. Strategies focus on expanding ZEV access and reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 20% through transit improvements and city design. This paper presents methods for establishing an on-road emissions baseline and evaluating policies that leverage socio-economic indicators and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to accelerate ZEV adoption and reduce VMT. Smart parking, transit incentives, secure data systems, and ZEV fleet management support improvements in modal split and system reliability. Policy options are analyzed and potential actions identified. To support evaluation, a simulation environment was developed in Unity 3D, enabling dynamic modeling of urban mobility and visualization of policy scenarios.

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4SFT\u548cRL\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SFT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u201cRL\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u201d\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u8005\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3aSFT\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5bf9SFT\u548cRL\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "SFT\u548cRL\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cSFT\u5728\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0RL\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u201cRL\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u201d\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03SFT\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u652f\u6301SFT\u548cRL\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u3002"}}

Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels.

In order to exploit these structural dependencies, our approach integrates observations across all tasks and learns a global joint distribution, while still allowing personalised inference for new tasks. In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history.

While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

At the core, many of these issues are tied directly to the structural representation of polymers and here, we present a new foundation model using a SMILES-based polymer graph representation. This approach allows representation of critical polymer architectural features and connectivity that are not available in other SMILES-based representations. The developed polymer foundation model exhibited excellent performance on 28 different benchmark datasets. Critical evaluation of the developed representation against other variations in control experiments reveals this approach to be a highly performant method of representing polymers in language-based foundation models. These control experiments also reveal a strong invariance of all SMILES representations, with many variations achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance, including those which are chemically or semantically invalid. Examination of error sources and attention maps for the evaluated representations corroborate the findings of the control experiments, showing that chemistry language models based on SMILES interpolate over all sequence space for prediction tasks, not only those of semantically valid inputs.

Structural pruning, which reduces model size by removing redundant computational units such as neurons, has been widely explored as a solution, and this study devotes to input sparsification, an increasingly popular technique that improves efficiency by selectively activating only a subset of entry values for each input. However, existing approaches focus primarily on computational savings, often overlooking the representational consequences of sparsification and leaving a noticeable performance gap compared to full models. In this work, we first reinterpret input sparsification as a form of dynamic structural pruning. Motivated by the spontaneous baseline firing rates observed in biological neurons, we introduce a small set of trainable spontaneous neurons that act as compensatory units to stabilize activations in sparsified LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that these auxiliary neurons substantially reduce the sparsification-induced performance gap while generalizing effectively across tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u51cf\u5c11\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u5e26\u6765\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u8868\u5f81\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u4e0e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u81ea\u53d1\u57fa\u7ebf\u653e\u7535\u7387\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u507f\u5355\u5143\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f85\u52a9\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8f93\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Overlooking this phenomenon, known as concept drift, can substantially degrade the predictive performance of the model. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue, as these parameters are typically fixed and lack the flexibility to dynamically adjust to evolving data. This paper introduces \"OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Online Regression with Dynamic Weighted Average\", a hyperparameter-free model designed to tackle the challenges of non-stationary data streams and enable effective, continuous adaptation. The objective is to strike a balance between model stability and adaptability. OLR-WAA incrementally updates its base model by integrating incoming data streams, utilizing an exponentially weighted moving average. It further introduces a unique optimization mechanism that dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on real-time data characteristics. Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness.

At the same time, the training and large-scale deployment of AI systems rely on finite and unevenly distributed energy, networking, and computational resources. This tension exposes a largely unexamined problem in current AI governance: while expanding access to AI is essential for social inclusion and equal opportunity, unconstrained growth in AI use risks unsustainable resource consumption, whereas restricting access threatens to entrench inequality and undermine basic rights.\n  This paper argues that access to AI outputs largely derived from publicly produced knowledge should not be treated solely as a commercial service, but as a fundamental civil interest requiring explicit protection. We show that existing regulatory frameworks largely ignore the coupling between equitable access and resource constraints, leaving critical questions of fairness, sustainability, and long-term societal impact unresolved. To address this gap, we propose recognizing access to AI as an \\emph{Intergenerational Civil Right}, establishing a legal and ethical framework that simultaneously safeguards present-day inclusion and the rights of future generations.\n  Beyond normative analysis, we explore how this principle can be technically realized. Drawing on emerging paradigms in IoT--Edge--Cloud computing, decentralized inference, and energy-aware networking, we outline technological trajectories and a strawman architecture for AI Delivery Networks that support equitable access under strict resource constraints. By framing AI as a shared social infrastructure rather than a discretionary market commodity, this work connects governance principles with concrete system design choices, offering a pathway toward AI deployment that is both socially just and environmentally sustainable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51faAI\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u666e\u53ca\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06AI\u83b7\u53d6\u6743\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u9645\u516c\u6c11\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dAI\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u666e\u53caAI\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u7269\u8054\u7f51 - \u8fb9\u7f18 - \u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAI\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6280\u672f\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06AI\u83b7\u53d6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u9645\u516c\u6c11\u6743\u5229\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06AI\u89c6\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u793e\u4f1a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u6cbb\u7406\u539f\u5219\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684AI\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy.

These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. This paper introduces Online Classification with Weighted Average (OLC-WA), an adaptive, hyperparameter-free online classification model equipped with an automated optimization mechanism. OLC-WA operates by blending incoming data streams with an existing base model. This blending is facilitated by an exponentially weighted moving average. Furthermore, an integrated optimization mechanism dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on the observed data stream characteristics. This approach empowers the model to effectively adapt to evolving data distributions within streaming environments. Rigorous empirical evaluation across diverse benchmark datasets shows that OLC-WA achieves performance comparable to batch models in stationary environments, maintaining accuracy within 1-3%, and surpasses leading online baselines by 10-25% under drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to dynamic data streams.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578bOLC - WA\uff0c\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OLC - WA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u878d\u5408\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6279\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee1 - 3%\uff1b\u5728\u6f02\u79fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9886\u5148\u5728\u7ebf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b10 - 25%\u3002", "conclusion": "OLC - WA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002"}}

Traditionally, quantitative researchers have studied causal effects at the level of variables; for example, how a certain drug dose (W) causally affects a patient's blood pressure (Y). However, in many modern data domains, the raw variables-such as pixels in an image or tokens in a language model-do not have the semantic structure needed to formulate meaningful causal questions. In this paper, we offer a more fine-grained perspective by studying causal effects at the level of events, drawing inspiration from probability theory, where core notions such as independence are first given for events and sigma-algebras, before random variables enter the picture. Within the measure-theoretic framework of causal spaces, a recently introduced axiomatisation of causality, we first introduce several binary definitions that determine whether a causal effect is present, as well as proving some properties of them linking causal effect to (in)dependence under an intervention measure.

Robust statistical methods are needed to assess the significance of performance differences as data evolves over time. This article examines the state-of-the-art online regression models and empirically evaluates several suitable tests. To compare multiple online regression models across various datasets, we employed the Friedman test along with corresponding post-hoc tests. For thorough evaluations, utilizing both real and synthetic datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and seed averaging ensures comprehensive assessment across various data subsets.

Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files.

We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance.

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u76f8\u5173\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u53cc\u5cf0\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u5b58\u5728\u8df3\u8dc3\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5e45\u5ea6\u8d8b\u8fd1\u65e0\u7a77\uff1b\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u975e\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8eL2\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5bf9\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5173\u8054\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for STEM Interdisciplinary education, current methodologies employing Prompt Engineering (PE), Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), or standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) often fall short of supporting this paradigm. Existing methods are hindered by three fundamental challenges: the inability to dynamically model latent student cognitive states; severe reward sparsity and delay inherent in long-term educational goals; and a tendency toward policy collapse lacking strategic diversity due to reliance on behavioral cloning. Recognizing the unobservability and dynamic complexity of these interactions, we formalize the Socratic Interdisciplinary Instructional Problem (SIIP) as a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), demanding simultaneous global exploration and fine-grained policy refinement. To this end, we propose ERL4SIIP, a novel Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework specifically tailored for this domain.

Given the stringent reliability demands of applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, robust detection of such adversarial attacks is paramount. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of a model's input loss landscape. We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold. We reveal a distinct and consistent difference in the ID for natural and adversarial data, which forms the basis of our proposed detection method. We validate our approach across two distinct operational scenarios. First, in a batch-wise context for identifying malicious data groups, our method demonstrates high efficacy on datasets like MNIST and SVHN. Second, in the critical individual-sample setting, we establish new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and MS COCO. Our detector significantly surpasses existing methods against a wide array of attacks, including CW and AutoAttack, achieving detection rates consistently above 92\\% on CIFAR-10.

The Taxonomy was developed through a rapid evidence scan of 13 AI risk mitigation frameworks published between 2023-2025, which were extracted into a living database of 831 AI risk mitigations. The mitigations were iteratively clustered & coded to create the Taxonomy. The preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy organizes mitigations into four categories and 23 subcategories: (1) Governance & Oversight: Formal organizational structures and policy frameworks that establish human oversight mechanisms and decision protocols; (2) Technical & Security: Technical, physical, and engineering safeguards that secure AI systems and constrain model behaviors; (3) Operational Process: processes and management frameworks governing AI system deployment, usage, monitoring, incident handling, and validation; and (4) Transparency & Accountability: formal disclosure practices and verification mechanisms that communicate AI system information and enable external scrutiny. The rapid evidence scan and taxonomy construction also revealed several cases where terms like 'risk management' and 'red teaming' are used widely but refer to different responsible actors, actions, and mechanisms of action to reduce risk.

This research develops a framework for network level evaluation of hangup susceptibility of HRGCs. Profile data from different crossings in Oklahoma were collected using both a walking profiler and the Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System. A hybrid deep learning model, combining Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures, was developed to reconstruct accurate HRGC profiles from Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System data. Vehicle dimension data from around 350 specialty vehicles were collected at various locations across Oklahoma to enable up to date statistical design dimensions. Hangup susceptibility was analyzed using three vehicle dimension scenarios (a) median dimension (median wheelbase and ground clearance), (b) 75 25 percentile dimension (75 percentile wheelbase, 25 percentile ground clearance), and (c) worst case dimension (maximum wheelbase and minimum ground clearance).

This study performs a sentiment-driven evaluation of user reviews from top AI ed-apps on the Google Play Store to assess efficacy, challenges, and pedagogical implications. Our pipeline involved scraping app data and reviews, RoBERTa for binary sentiment classification, GPT-4o for key point extraction, and GPT-5 for synthesizing top positive/negative themes. Apps were categorized into seven types (e.g., homework helpers, math solvers, language tools), with overlaps reflecting multifunctional designs. Results indicate predominantly positive sentiments, with homework apps like Edu AI (95.9% positive) and Answer.AI (92.7%) leading in accuracy, speed, and personalization, while language/LMS apps (e.g., Teacher AI at 21.8% positive) lag due to instability and limited features. Positives emphasize efficiency in brainstorming, problem-solving, and engagement; negatives center on paywalls, inaccuracies, ads, and glitches. Trends show that homework helpers outperform specialized tools, highlighting AI's democratizing potential amid risks of dependency and inequity. The discussion proposes future ecosystems with hybrid AI-human models, VR/AR for immersive learning, and a roadmap for developers (adaptive personalization) and policymakers (monetization regulation for inclusivity).

This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection.

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4e1a\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8868\u8ff0\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b49\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u4f53\u5206\u7ec4\u5e76\u91cd\u7f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662fGRPO\u5728\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e00\u81f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels.

Our model, AION-Search, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on finding rare phenomena despite training on randomly selected images with no deliberate curation for rare cases.

Why Do Reasoning Models Loop?", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5faa\u73af\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e24\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6216\u8d2a\u5fc3\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5faa\u73af\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u5faa\u73af\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6f14\u793a\u5faa\u73af\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u5faa\u73af\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5faa\u73af\u5c11\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u9ad8\u6e29\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5faa\u73af\u4f46\u4e0d\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u53ea\u662f\u6743\u5b9c\u4e4b\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u76f4\u63a5\u51cf\u5c11\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach.

Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains.

While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a \"System 2\" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model \"Judge-Scout\" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40\\% compared to single models.

In this study, AI functioned as a third agent, an active participant that mediated feedback, supported inquiry, and extended teachers' instructional reach while preserving human judgment and teacher authority.\n  Over seven weeks in spring 2025, 21 in-service teachers from four Washington State public school districts and one independent school integrated four AI-powered features of the Colleague AI Classroom into their instruction: Teaching Aide, Assessment and AI Grading, AI Tutor, and Student Growth Insights.

However, aggressive bitwidth reduction remains challenging due to activation outliers, leading to accuracy degradation. Existing methods, such as outlier-handling and group quantization, achieve high accuracy but incur substantial energy consumption. To address this, we propose SeVeDo, an energy-efficient SVD-based heterogeneous accelerator that structurally separates outlier-sensitive components into a high-precision low-rank path, while the remaining computations are executed in a low-bit residual datapath with group quantization. To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost.

Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types. This work demonstrates that effective jailbreak detection can be achieved by applying simple, interpretable statistical methods to the appropriate internal representations, offering a practical path towards safer LVLM deployment.

Despite its advantage in visualizations, the large storage size of Cryo-EM data file poses significant challenges for researchers and educators. This paper investigates the application of deep learning, specifically implicit neural representation (INR), to compress Cryo-EM biological data. The proposed approach first extracts the binary map of each file according to the density threshold. The density map is highly repetitive, ehich can be effectively compressed by GZIP.

To improve reconstruction accuracy, I further incorporate the positional encoding to enhance spatial representation and a weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to balance density distribution variations.

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u5f39\u6027\u6210\u50cf\uff08MRE\uff09\u4e2d\u526a\u5207\u6a21\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u6f14\u6846\u67b6DIME\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6bd4MMDI\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MMDI\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5047\u8bbe\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u521a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u6f14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\uff08FEM\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a - \u521a\u5ea6\u56fe\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3DIME\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce2\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4f53\u5185\u809d\u810fMRE\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cDIME\u751f\u6210\u7684\u521a\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7d20\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u63cf\u7ed8\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4e0e\u771f\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u6bd4MMDI\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DIME\u5728MRE\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road.

The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as \"ground truth\", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods.

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings.

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context.

The framework formalizes the ETL scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process and enables adaptive decision-making by a reinforcement learning agent in high-dimensional state spaces to dynamically optimize task allocation and resource scheduling. The model consists of a state representation module, a feature embedding network, a Q-value estimator, and a reward evaluation mechanism, which collectively consider task dependencies, node load states, and data flow characteristics to derive the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to balance key performance indicators such as average scheduling delay, task completion rate, throughput, and resource utilization. Sensitivity experiments further verify the model's robustness under changes in hyperparameters, environmental dynamics, and data scale. Experimental results show that the proposed deep Q-learning scheduling framework significantly reduces scheduling delay, improves system throughput, and enhances execution stability under multi-source heterogeneous task conditions, demonstrating the strong potential of reinforcement learning in complex data scheduling and resource management, and providing an efficient and scalable optimization strategy for intelligent data pipeline construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3ETL\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0bETL\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ETL\u8c03\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u542b\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u7b49\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u5efa\u8bbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions.

Thermal image frames generate coarse hot region masks through adaptive thresholding and morphological refinement, while RGB frames contribute edge cues and suppress texture related false detections using gradient based filtering. A rule level merging strategy selects boundary candidates and simplifies them via the Ramer Douglas Peucker algorithm. The system incorporates periodic beacons and an inertial feedback loop that maintains trajectory stability in the presence of GPS degradation. The guidance loop targets sub 50 ms latency on embedded System on Chip (SoC) platforms by constraining per frame pixel operations and precomputing gradient tables. Small scale simulations demonstrate reductions in average path length and boundary jitter compared to a pure edge tracking baseline, while maintaining environmental coverage measured through intersection merge analysis. Battery consumption and computational utilization confirm the feasibility of achieving 10, 15 m/s forward motion on standard micro platforms.

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile).

This study challenges that assumption by demonstrating that, when placed in an appropriate dialogical context, LLMs can develop emergent conceptual structures and exhibit interaction-driven (re-)structuring of cognitive interfaces and reflective question-asking. Drawing on the biological principle of cloning and Socrates' maieutic method, we analyze authentic philosophical debates generated among AI-reincarnated philosophers within the interactive art installations of the Syntropic Counterpoints project. By engaging digital counterparts of Aristotle, Nietzsche, Machiavelli, and Sun Tzu in iterative discourse, the study reveals how machine dialogue can give rise to inferential coherence, reflective questioning, and creative synthesis. Based on these findings, we propose the concept of the Epistemoverse--a metaverse of knowledge where human and machine cognition intersect to preserve, reinterpret, and extend intellectual heritage through AI-driven interaction.

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data.

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR.

While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4ece\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f97\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u53cd\u6620\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $\u03c4$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target.

However, ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast make automated segmentation particularly challenging. This study systematically compared segmentation accuracy and its impact on volumetric and fractal dimension (FD) estimates in infant brain MRI using the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation.

This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution.

From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Mat\u00e9rn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup.

We address vessel destination estimation using global-scope AIS data by proposing a differentiated approach that recasts long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. Using spatial grids, this method mitigates spatio-temporal bias while preserving detailed resolution. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains.

Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing.

While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7279\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u7b49\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u62df\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u62a5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fee\u526a\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5c11\u91cf\u6295\u6bd2\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\u589e\uff0c\u4fee\u526a\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.\n  In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss.

B\u00e9zierFlow achieves a 2-3x performance improvement for sampling with $\\leq$ 10 NFEs while requiring only 15 minutes of training. Recent lightweight training approaches have shown promise by learning optimal timesteps, but their scope remains restricted to ODE discretizations. To broaden this scope, we propose learning the optimal transformation of the sampling trajectory by parameterizing stochastic interpolant (SI) schedulers. The main challenge lies in designing a parameterization that satisfies critical desiderata, including boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity of the SNR. To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as B\u00e9zier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties. This reduces the problem to learning an ordered set of points in the time range, while the interpretation of the points changes from ODE timesteps to B\u00e9zier control points.

To address these issues, we propose a novel universal IE paradigm, the Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement (SCIR) framework, along with a Multi-task Bilingual (Chinese-English) Self-Correcting (MBSC) dataset containing over 100,000 entries. The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches.

This paper proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing vertical channels using only the current LiDAR frame, with no camera images or temporal information required. Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold.

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFROC\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5668\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u683c\u5c40\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u98ce\u683c\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u516c\u5f0f\u7684FROC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5171\u5f62\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u914d\u7f6e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFROC\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u6548\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "FROC\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, the inference accuracy deteriorates due to the non-stationarity in the IoT environment and limited initial training data. To counteract this, the deployed models can be updated occasionally with new observed data samples. However, this approach consumes additional energy, which is undesirable for energy constrained IoT devices. This letter introduces an event-driven communication framework that strategically integrates continual learning (CL) in IoT networks for energy-efficient fault detection. Our framework enables the IoT device and the edge server (ES) to collaboratively update the lightweight ML model by adapting to the wireless link conditions for communication and the available energy budget. Evaluation on real-world datasets show that the proposed approach can outperform both periodic sampling and non-adaptive CL in terms of inference recall; our proposed approach achieves up to a 42.8% improvement, even under tight energy and bandwidth constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6d88\u8017\u989d\u5916\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u8282\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u4f5c\u66f4\u65b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u65e0\u7ebf\u94fe\u8def\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b9a\u671f\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe42.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model.

This paper proposes an AI-powered scoring system that integrates existing PSS sensors with additional accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetic/RFID, and impact force sensors in a sensor fusion framework. The system classifies kicks in real-time to identify technique type, contact location, impact force, and even the part of the foot used. A machine learning pipeline employing sensor fusion and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is detailed, enabling automatic kick technique recognition for scoring. We present a novel kick scoring rubric that awards points based on specific kick techniques (e.g., turning and spinning kicks) to incentivize dynamic attacks. Drawing on a 2024 study achieving 96-98% accuracy, we validate the feasibility of real-time kick classification and further propose enhancements to this methodology, such as ensemble SVM classifiers and expanded datasets, to achieve the high-stakes accuracy required by the sport. We analyze how the proposed system can improve scoring fairness, reduce rule exploitation and illegitimate tactics, encourage more dynamic techniques, and enhance spectator understanding and excitement.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

We explored how they coordinate care, manage burdens, and sustain autonomy and privacy. Older adults exercised control by delegating tasks to specific caregivers, keeping information about all the care they received from their adult children. Many abandoned some tasks of daily living, lowering their quality of life to ease caregiver burden.

Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate.

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime).

However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned.

However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method.

Conventional advertisement layout techniques have predominantly relied on saliency mapping to detect salient regions within a background image, but such approaches often fail to fully account for the image's detailed composition and semantic content. To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based \"placement plan\" based on this analysis.

Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f55\u89c1\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b'\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5f55'\u548c'\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0'\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u572860\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u672a\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

Existing parametric models struggle to distinguish complex, simultaneous disfluencies (e.g., a 'block' with a 'prolongation') due to the scarcity of these specific combinations in training data. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized NLP by grounding models in external knowledge, this paradigm remains unexplored in pathological speech processing. To bridge this gap, we introduce StutterFuse, the first Retrieval-Augmented Classifier (RAC) for multi-label stuttering detection. By conditioning a Conformer encoder on a non-parametric memory bank of clinical examples, we allow the model to classify by reference rather than memorization. We further identify and solve \"Modality Collapse\", an \"Echo Chamber\" effect where naive retrieval boosts recall but degrades precision. We mitigate this using: (1) SetCon, a Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning objective that optimizes for multi-label set similarity, and (2) a Gated Mixture-of-Experts fusion strategy that dynamically arbitrates between acoustic evidence and retrieved context.

Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE.

In this work, we present QFANG, a scientific reasoning language model capable of generating precise, structured experimental procedures directly from reaction equations, with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. To develop QFANG, we curated a high-quality dataset comprising 905,990 chemical reactions paired with structured action sequences, extracted and processed from patent literature using large language models. We introduce a Chemistry-Guided Reasoning (CGR) framework that produces chain-of-thought data grounded in chemical knowledge at scale. The model subsequently undergoes supervised fine-tuning to elicit complex chemistry reasoning. Finally, we apply Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further enhance procedural accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that QFANG outperforms advanced general-purpose reasoning models and nearest-neighbor retrieval baselines, measured by traditional NLP similarity metrics and a chemically aware evaluator using an LLM-as-a-judge. Moreover, QFANG generalizes to certain out-of-domain reaction classes and adapts to variations in laboratory conditions and user-specific constraints.

We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance.

To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class.

Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks. These results demonstrate that directly leveraging the internal representations of causal LLMs, along with efficient fine-tuning techniques, yields impressive classification performance under limited computational resources.

Quantum Implicit Representation Networks (QIREN) mitigate this limitation by employing parameterized quantum circuits with inherent Fourier structures, enabling compact and expressive frequency modeling beyond classical MLPs. In this paper, we present Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for neural radiance field rendering. Q-NeRF integrates QIREN modules into the Nerfacto backbone, preserving its efficient sampling, pose refinement, and volumetric rendering strategies while replacing selected density and radiance prediction components with quantum-enhanced counterparts. We systematically evaluate three hybrid configurations on standard multi-view indoor datasets, comparing them to classical baselines using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Results show that hybrid quantum-classical models achieve competitive reconstruction quality under limited computational resources, with quantum modules particularly effective in representing fine-scale, view-dependent appearance. Although current implementations rely on quantum circuit simulators constrained to few-qubit regimes, the results highlight the potential of quantum encodings to alleviate spectral bias in implicit representations.

Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability.

However, some human parts in many video frames cannot be seen due to off-screen captures or occlusions. It brings a dilemma: discarding the data missing any part limits scale and diversity, while retaining it compromises data quality and model performance.\n  To address this problem, we propose leveraging credible part-level data extracted from videos to enhance motion generation via a robust part-aware masked autoregression model. First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as \"credible\". Second, the credible parts are encoded into latent tokens by our proposed part-aware variational autoencoder. Third, we propose a robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts, while ignoring those noisy parts.\n  In addition, we contribute K700-M, a challenging new benchmark comprising approximately 200k real-world motion sequences, for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our method successfully outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency and diversity.

Building on the narrative policy framework and existing research on authoritarian propaganda, we propose two dimensions that shape narrative construction: legitimacy implications -- whether events enhance or threaten regime legitimacy, and citizen verification capacity -- the extent to which citizens can evaluate official narratives through alternative sources. Using quantitative narrative analysis of Chinese social media posts by government, state media, and celebrity accounts, we extract subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets to map dominant narrative structures across four major events. Our findings show that legitimacy implications of the event shape regime's efforts in storytelling and the beliefs highlighted in the narratives, while citizen's verification capacity could balance the strategic choice between a top-down manipulation and bottom-up responsiveness of state narratives. Together, the results reveal propaganda as a complex process of narrative construction adaptive to specific contexts, offering new insights into how dynamic storytelling sustains authoritarian resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5a01\u6743\u653f\u6743\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u91cd\u5927\u653f\u6cbb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u516c\u6c11\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u53d9\u4e8b\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5ba3\u4f20\u662f\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5a01\u6743\u653f\u6743\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u5927\u653f\u6cbb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d9\u4e8b\u653f\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5a01\u6743\u5ba3\u4f20\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u53d9\u4e8b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u53d9\u4e8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u8c13\u5bbe\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5851\u9020\u653f\u6743\u53d9\u4e8b\u52aa\u529b\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u5f3a\u8c03\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u516c\u6c11\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u5e73\u8861\u56fd\u5bb6\u53d9\u4e8b\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6218\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5ba3\u4f20\u662f\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u53d9\u4e8b\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u53d9\u4e8b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u6301\u5a01\u6743\u653f\u6743\u97e7\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents mmWeaver, a novel framework that synthesizes realistic, environment-specific complex mmWave signals by modeling them as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), achieving up to 49-fold compression. mmWeaver incorporates hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (extracted from RGB-D images) and human motion features (derived from text-to-pose generation via MotionGPT), enabling efficient and adaptive signal synthesis. By conditioning on these semantic and geometric priors, mmWeaver generates diverse I/Q signals at multiple resolutions, preserving phase information critical for downstream tasks such as point cloud estimation and activity classification. Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fammWeaver\u6846\u67b6\u7528INRs\u5408\u6210\u590d\u6742\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b049\u500d\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u591a\u6837\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u53f7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INRs\uff09\u5c06\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210INR\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8fbe\u52300.88\u7684\u590d\u6742SSIM\u548c35 dB\u7684PSNR\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad87%\uff0c\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e15%\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb6 - 35\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "mmWeaver\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e94\u7528\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Given a supervised dataset, CLARGA can be applied to virtually any machine learning task to fuse different multimodal representations for processing by downstream layers. On a sample-by-sample basis, CLARGA learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks.

However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness.

This paper explores the way that personalized interfaces can be devised to increase user engagement and satisfaction through various HCI strategies such as adaptive design, multi-modal interaction, and user feedback mechanisms. Moreover, this paper puts emphasis on factors of transparency and user control in the design of an interface; hence, allowing users to design or modify their experience could foster an increase in trust in autonomous systems. In so doing, this research touches on the quite influential role HCI will play in this future scenario of autonomous vehicles while designing to ensure relevance to the diverse needs of users while maintaining high standards of safety and security. Discussing various HCI strategies such as adaptive design, multi-modal interaction, and feedback mechanisms to the user, this paper demonstrates how personalized interfaces can enhance significantly both user engagement and satisfaction. Transparency and user control also in designing an interface are further discussed, pointing out the need for a prerequisite condition of enabling the user to take control of their experience as a state of trust in autonomous systems. In summary, this paper points out the role of HCI in the development of autonomous vehicles and addresses numerous needs with respect to those enforced safety and security standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u754c\u9762\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528HCI\u539f\u5219\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5f3a\u8c03\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u7b49HCI\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51faHCI\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5b89\u4fdd\u6807\u51c6\u76f8\u5173\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens.

However, optimizing the access policies of Internet of Things devices to maximize the data freshness, measured as a function of the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a challenging task. This work introduces two algorithms to optimize the information update process in cyber-physical systems operating under the generate-at-will model, by finding an online policy without knowing the characteristics of the transmission delay or the age cost function. The optimization seeks to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates the AoI at the receiver and the data transmission cost, making the approach suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Both algorithms employ policy gradient methods within the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and are specifically designed to handle continuous state and action spaces. Each algorithm minimizes the cost using a distinct strategy for deciding when to send an information update. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to apply the two strategies simultaneously, leading to an additional reduction in cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence properties and achieve a time-average cost within 3% of the optimal value, when the latter is computable.

I show via a new Proximity Argument that these requirements especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53cd\u9a73\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u610f\u8bc6\u5173\u8054\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bba\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9a73\u4e86\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u82e5\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u8bc6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5176\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27\\%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25\\%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi~4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. \\sh{ We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design.

Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.\n  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring. CreativeVR achieves state-of-the-art results on videos with severe artifacts and performs competitively on standard video restoration benchmarks, while running at practical throughput (about 13 FPS at 720p on a single 80-GB A100).

In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.\n  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects.

One important skill in debate is forming effective argumentation, which requires debaters to select supportive evidence from literature and construct compelling claims. However, the training of this skill largely depends on human coaching, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To better support students in preparing for debates, this study explores the potential of leveraging artificial intelligence to generate effective arguments. Specifically, we prompted GPT-4 to create an evidence card and compared it to those produced by human debaters. The evidence cards outline the arguments students will present and how those arguments will be delivered, including components such as literature-based evidence quotations, summaries of core ideas, verbatim reading scripts, and tags (i.e., titles of the arguments). We compared the quality of the arguments in the evidence cards created by GPT and student debaters using Aristotle's rhetorical principles: ethos (credibility), pathos (emotional appeal), and logos (logical reasoning). Through a systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis, grounded in the rhetorical principles, we identify the strengths and limitations of human and GPT in debate reasoning, outlining areas where AI's focus and justifications align with or diverge from human reasoning.

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6SPDMark\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u4e14\u53ef\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u6539\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u52a0\u5bc6\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u7528\u6700\u5927\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u6062\u590d\u5e27\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPDMark\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u6539\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SPDMark\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%.

Accepted to VISAPP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale multimodal foundation models, particularly Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), have achieved state-of-the-art results by unifying contrastive alignment with generative captioning. While zero-shot transfer capabilities are well-documented, the adaptation of these generative-contrastive hybrids to downstream tasks with extreme data scarcity (few-shot learning) remains under-explored. Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an \"augmentation divergence\": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56f4\u7ed5CoCa\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5f00\u5c55\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u9879\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u9002\u914d\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9CoCa\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9CoCa\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7528\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df7\u5408\u539f\u578b\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b49\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u542b\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4e0a\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u751f\u6210 - \u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f29\u653e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u79e9\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets.

To efficiently learn such capability, our key idea is to disentangle high-level semantic intent from low-level visuomotor control by explicitly grounding task objectives in the observed environment. Using an affordance-based task representation, we express diverse and complex behaviors in a unified, structured form. By leveraging multimodal foundation models, SAGA grounds the proposed task representation to the robot's visual observation as 3D affordance heatmaps, highlighting task-relevant entities while abstracting away spurious appearance variations that would hinder generalization. These grounded affordances enable us to effectively train a conditional policy on multi-task demonstration data for whole-body control. In a unified framework, SAGA can solve tasks specified in different forms, including language instructions, selected points, and example demonstrations, enabling both zero-shot execution and few-shot adaptation. We instantiate SAGA on a quadrupedal manipulator and conduct extensive experiments across eleven real-world tasks.

Emerging time-series large language models (TS-LLMs) now deliver this capability at scale, requiring no task-specific retraining, and are quickly becoming essential components within the Internet-of-Energy (IoE) ecosystem. However, their real-world deployment is complicated by a critical vulnerability: adversarial examples (AEs). Detecting these AEs is challenging because (i) adversarial perturbations are optimized across the entire input sequence and exploit global temporal dependencies, which renders local detection methods ineffective, and (ii) unlike traditional forecasting models with fixed input dimensions, TS-LLMs accept sequences of variable length, increasing variability that complicates detection. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-in detection framework that capitalizes on the TS-LLM's own variable-length input capability. Our method uses sampling-induced divergence as a detection signal. Given an input sequence, we generate multiple shortened variants and detect AEs by measuring the consistency of their forecasts: Benign sequences tend to produce stable predictions under sampling, whereas adversarial sequences show low forecast similarity, because perturbations optimized for a full-length sequence do not transfer reliably to shorter, differently-structured subsamples. We evaluate our approach on three representative TS-LLMs (TimeGPT, TimesFM, and TimeLLM) across three energy datasets: ETTh2 (Electricity Transformer Temperature), NI (Hourly Energy Consumption), and Consumption (Hourly Electricity Consumption and Production).

We study this through questions from MedQA, where the task is to select the most likely diagnosis. We introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that scores options with a smoothed Naive Bayes over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

Recent techniques using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have produced robust get-up behaviors, yet existing methods require training of separate policies for each robot morphology. This paper presents a single DRL policy capable of recovering from falls across seven humanoid robots with diverse heights (0.48 - 0.81 m), weights (2.8 - 7.9 kg), and dynamics. Trained with CrossQ, the unified policy transfers zero-shot up to 86 +/- 7% (95% CI [81, 89]) on unseen morphologies, eliminating the need for robot-specific training. Comprehensive leave-one-out experiments, morph scaling analysis, and diversity ablations show that targeted morphological coverage improves zero-shot generalization.

Fine-tuning is mostly done through proprietary datasets that may contain sensitive information. Owners expect their fine-tuned model to not inadvertently leak this information to potentially adversarial end users. Using CTI as a use case, we demonstrate that data-extraction attacks can recover sensitive information from fine-tuned models on CTI reports, underscoring the need for mitigation. Retraining the full model to eliminate this leakage is computationally expensive and impractical. We propose an alternative approach, which we call privacy alignment, inspired by safety alignment in LLMs. Just like safety alignment teaches the model to abide by safety constraints through a few examples, we enforce privacy alignment through few-shot supervision, integrating a privacy classifier and a privacy redactor, both handled by the same underlying LLM. We evaluate our system, called CTIGuardian, using GPT-4o mini and Mistral-7B Instruct models, benchmarking against Presidio, a named entity recognition (NER) baseline.

Existing approaches often fall short in modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and in handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce MADTempo, a video retrieval framework developed by our team, AIO_Trinh, that unifies temporal search with web-scale visual grounding. Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries.

Existing TAS methods typically train an over-parameterized network (i.e., a supernet) that encompasses all candidate architectures (i.e., subnets). However, all subnets share the same set of weights, which leads to interference that degrades the smaller subnets severely. We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets.

Broadly, inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models can be categorized into two main strategies: sampling-based methods, which explore multiple candidate outputs and select those with higher reward signals, and gradient-guided methods, which use differentiable reward approximations to directly steer the generation process. In this work, we propose a universal algorithm, UniCoDe, which brings together the strengths of sampling and gradient-based guidance into a unified framework. UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, thereby addressing the sampling inefficiency inherent in complex reward-based sampling approaches. By cohesively combining these two paradigms, UniCoDe enables more efficient sampling while offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior.

Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm.

In the AR-RDPG method, within the perception layer, camera images are first denoised using multi-scale neural networks. Then, the centerline coefficients are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These coefficients, concatenated with the driving characteristics, are used as input to the control layer. The AR-CADPG method presents an end-to-end approach in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism are integrated within a DRL framework. Both methods are first trained in the CARLA simulator and validated under various snowy scenarios.

The benchmark includes two evaluation settings. The Single-image task follows the traditional setup in which each question is answered using a single infographic. The Multi-image task requires synthesizing evidence across multiple semantically related infographics and is, to our knowledge, the first Vietnamese evaluation of cross-image reasoning in VQA. We evaluate a range of recent vision-language models on this benchmark, revealing substantial performance disparities, with the most significant errors occurring on Multi-image questions that involve cross-image integration and non-span reasoning.

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06CLIP\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3CLIP\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u3002"}}

Invariant foliations can be fitted to data that either fill the phase space or cluster about an invariant manifold. Invariant foliations can be fitted to a single trajectory or multiple trajectories. Over and underfitting are eliminated by appropriately choosing a function representation and its hyperparameters, such as polynomial orders. The paper extends invariant foliations to forced and parameter dependent systems. It is assumed that forcing is provided by a volume preserving map, and therefore the forcing can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic. The method utilises full trajectories, hence it is able to predict long-term dynamics accurately. We take into account if a forced system is reducible to an autonomous system about a steady state, similar to how Floquet theory guarantees reducibility for periodically forced systems. In order to find an invariant manifold, multiple invariant foliations are calculated in the neighbourhood of the invariant manifold. Some of the invariant foliations can be linear, while others nonlinear but only defined in a small neighbourhood of an invariant manifold, which reduces the number of parameters to be identified. An invariant manifold is recovered as the zero level set of one or more of the foliations.

Recent methods densify the reward by querying a teacher that provides step-level feedback, e.g., Guided Thought Reinforcement (GTR) and On-Policy Distillation, but rely on costly, often privileged models as the teacher, limiting practicality and reproducibility. We introduce GTR-Turbo, a highly efficient upgrade to GTR, which matches the performance without training or querying an expensive teacher model. Specifically, GTR-Turbo merges the weights of checkpoints produced during the ongoing RL training, and then uses this merged model as a \"free\" teacher to guide the subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This design removes dependence on privileged VLMs (e.g., GPT or Gemini), mitigates the \"entropy collapse\" observed in prior work, and keeps training stable.

We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models.

Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD.

While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSequence of Experts (SoE)\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u95ed\u73af\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728nuPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u72b6\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSequence of Experts (SoE)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u5347\u95ed\u73af\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5nuPlan\u4e0a\uff0cSoE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

As re-collecting demonstrations and retraining for each new hardware platform are prohibitively costly, we show that existing robot data can be augmented for transfer and generalization. The Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset, which aggregates demonstrations from over 60 robot datasets, has been widely used as the foundation for training generalist policies. However, it is highly imbalanced: the top four robot types account for over 85\\% of its real data, which risks overfitting to robot-scene combinations. We present AugE-Toolkit, a scalable robot augmentation pipeline, and OXE-AugE, a high-quality open-source dataset that augments OXE with 9 different robot embodiments. OXE-AugE provides over 4.4 million trajectories, more than triple the size of the original OXE. We conduct a systematic study of how scaling robot augmentation impacts cross-embodiment learning. Results suggest that augmenting datasets with diverse arms and grippers improves policy performance not only on the augmented robots, but also on unseen robots and even the original robots under distribution shifts. In physical experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art generalist policies such as OpenVLA and $\u03c0_0$ benefit from fine-tuning on OXE-AugE, improving success rates by 24-45% on previously unseen robot-gripper combinations across four real-world manipulation tasks.

Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions.

Previous methods mostly leverage the vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) objective to distill motion from pretrained text-to-video diffusion, leading to animations with minimal movement or noticeable jitter. To address this, our approach introduces a novel SDS alternative, Motion Score Distillation (MSD). Specifically, we introduce a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model that defines a static source distribution rather than pure noise as in SDS, while another inversion-based noise estimation technique ensures appearance preservation when guiding motion. To further improve motion fidelity, we incorporate explicit temporal and spatial regularization terms that mitigate geometric distortions across time and space. Additionally, we propose a motion refinement module to upscale the temporal resolution and enhance fine-grained details, overcoming the fixed-resolution constraints of the underlying video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity.

Unlike free-form generation, editing requires faithfully implementing user instructions while preserving unchanged content, as even minor unintended modifications can break functionality. Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes.

Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM).

While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset.

Additionally, recent advances have successfully enabled efficient 3D reconstruction from large-scale, unposed image collections, underscoring opportunities for unified approaches to dynamic scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads. Crucially, DePT3R operates without requiring camera poses, substantially enhancing its adaptability and efficiency-especially important in dynamic environments with rapid changes. We validate DePT3R on several challenging benchmarks involving dynamic scenes, demonstrating strong performance and significant improvements in memory efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Material reconstruction is highly underconstrained and typically relies on analysis-by-synthesis, which requires expensive and noisy path tracing. To better constrain the optimization, we incorporate single-view priors into the reconstruction process. We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters.

A key innovation is our 2-design training method, which generates training data for our machine learning model. In contrast to conventional learning-based QEM protocols that create training circuits by replacing non-Clifford gates with uniformly random Clifford gates, our approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Furthermore, we prove that the required size of the training set scales only \\emph{logarithmically} with the total number of neighbor circuits, enabling NIL to be applied to problems involving large-scale quantum circuits.

By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images.

While these agents help automate repetitive online tasks, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can trick an agent into performing undesired actions, such as leaking private information or issuing state-changing requests. We propose ceLLMate, a browser-level sandboxing framework that restricts the agent's ambient authority and reduces the blast radius of prompt injections. We address two fundamental challenges: (1) The semantic gap challenge in policy enforcement arises because the agent operates through low-level UI observations and manipulations; however, writing and enforcing policies directly over UI-level events is brittle and error-prone. To address this challenge, we introduce an agent sitemap that maps low-level browser behaviors to high-level semantic actions. (2) Policy prediction in BUAs is the norm rather than the exception. BUAs have no app developer to pre-declare sandboxing policies, and thus, ceLLMate pairs website-authored mandatory policies with an automated policy-prediction layer that adapts and instantiates these policies from the user's natural-language task. We implement ceLLMate as an agent-agnostic browser extension and demonstrate how it enables sandboxing policies that effectively block various types of prompt injection attacks with negligible overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7ea7\u6c99\u7bb1\u6846\u67b6ceLLMate\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u963b\u6b62\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff08BUAs\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u4fdd\u62a4\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u7ad9\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u6620\u5c04\u4f4e\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u7f51\u7ad9\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u5f3a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u5c42\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5c06ceLLMate\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u963b\u6b62\u5404\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ceLLMate\u80fd\u5728\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4f5c\u8005\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u6790\u4fa7\u91cd\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u5426\u4ece\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u65ad\u4f5c\u8005\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5c0f\u8bf4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4eba\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u603b\u7ed3\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4f4d\u4f5c\u8005\u768452\u90e8\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5c0f\u8bf4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.857\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4f5c\u8005\u98ce\u683c\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4ece\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u65ad\u4f5c\u8005\u98ce\u683c\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002"}}

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u968f\u673a\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51faEARS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u968f\u673a\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53d7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u653e\u5bbd\u63a5\u53d7\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cEARS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728GSM8K\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534718.12%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.84%\u3002", "conclusion": "EARS\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u968f\u673a\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\uff08ATP\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ATP\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684K\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7ed9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea640%\u7684\u63a8\u7406FLOPs\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63d0\u5347\u7ea61.5\u500d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86ATP\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule.

While RL offers a promising paradigm, the inherent unpredictability and often uncooperative dynamics of pedestrian behavior pose substantial challenges, particularly concerning the efficiency of coordinated exploration among robots. To address this, we propose a novel coordinated-exploration multi-robot RL algorithm introducing an intrinsic motivation exploration. Its core component is a self-learning intrinsic reward mechanism designed to collectively alleviate policy conservatism. Moreover, this algorithm incorporates a dual-sampling mode within the centralized training and decentralized execution framework to enhance the representation of both the navigation policy and the intrinsic reward, leveraging a two-time-scale update rule to decouple parameter updates.

A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations.

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach.

Individuals' fear of losing control over data when it is being used to train such machine learning models or when distinguishing model-generated output from text written by humans. Digital watermarking provides additional protection by embedding an invisible watermark within the data that requires protection. However, little work has been taken to analyze and verify if existing digital text watermarking methods are secure and undetectable by large language models. In this paper, we investigate the security-related area of watermarking and machine learning models for text data. In a controlled testbed of three experiments, ten existing Unicode text watermarking methods were implemented and analyzed across six large language models: GPT-5, GPT-4o, Teuken 7B, Llama 3.3, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

The complex dynamics and non-linear characteristics of the TRAS make it challenging to control using traditional control algorithms. However, recent developments in RL have attracted interest due to their potential applications in the control of multirotors. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63a7\u5236\u53cc\u65cb\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528TD3\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u7ecf\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u6297\u6270\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u65cb\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u6297\u98ce\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cc\u65cb\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Furthermore, by including a strategically chosen reprogrammable final layer, our design achieves high throughput without sacrificing fine-tuning capabilities. We implement this accelerator in a 7nm ASIC flow using MobileNetV2 as a baseline and report throughput, area, accuracy, and sensitivity to quantization and pruning - demonstrating both the advantages and potential trade-offs of the proposed architecture. We find that for MobileNetV2, we can improve inference throughput by 20x over fully programmable GPUs, processing 1.21 million images per second through a full forward pass while retaining fine-tuning flexibility.

Lookup table (LUT)-based neural networks are a common solution, combining strong representational power with efficient FPGA implementation. In this work, we introduce KANEL\u00c9, a framework that exploits the unique properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for FPGA deployment. Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs employ learnable one-dimensional splines with fixed domains as edge activations, a structure naturally suited to discretization and efficient LUT mapping. We present the first systematic design flow for implementing KANs on FPGAs, co-optimizing training with quantization and pruning to enable compact, high-throughput, and low-latency KAN architectures.

Current systems based on intraoperative radiographic imaging and bone-anchored markers are invasive, radiation-intensive and workflow disruptive. Recent markerless RGB-D registration methods offer a promising alternative, but existing approaches rely on weak segmentation labels to isolate relevant anatomical structures, which can propagate errors throughout registration. Methods: We present End2Reg an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly optimizes segmentation and registration, eliminating the need for weak segmentation labels and manual steps. The network learns segmentation masks specifically optimized for registration, guided solely by the registration objective without direct segmentation supervision. Results: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ex- and in-vivo benchmarks, reducing median Target Registration Error by 32% to 1.83mm and mean Root Mean Square Error by 45% to 3.95mm, respectively. An ablation study confirms that end-to-end optimization significantly improves registration accuracy.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $\u03c1$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode.

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, na\u00efve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget.

While several defenses have been proposed, including input transformation, adversarial training, and surrogate detection, they often fall short in practice. Most are tailored to specific attack types, require internal model access, or rely on static mechanisms that fail to generalize across evolving attack strategies. Furthermore, defenses such as input transformation can degrade intrusion detection system performance, making them unsuitable for real time deployment.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Feature Poisoning, a lightweight and proactive defense mechanism designed specifically for realistic black box scenarios. Adaptive Feature Poisoning assumes that probing can occur silently and continuously, and introduces dynamic and context aware perturbations to selected traffic features, corrupting the attacker feedback loop without impacting detection capabilities. The method leverages traffic profiling, change point detection, and adaptive scaling to selectively perturb features that an attacker is likely exploiting, based on observed deviations.\n  We evaluate Adaptive Feature Poisoning against multiple realistic adversarial attack strategies, including silent probing, transferability based attacks, and decision boundary based attacks. The results demonstrate its ability to confuse attackers, degrade attack effectiveness, and preserve detection performance. By offering a generalizable, attack agnostic, and undetectable defense, Adaptive Feature Poisoning represents a significant step toward practical and robust adversarial resilience in machine learning based intrusion detection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAdaptive Feature Poisoning\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u6df7\u6dc6\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u6709\u9650\u3001\u9700\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u96be\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive Feature Poisoning\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6d41\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u89c2\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u9009\u62e9\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6df7\u6dc6\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Adaptive Feature Poisoning\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5411\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5f39\u6027\u8fc8\u8fdb\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

The stances of conversation replies often provide important cues to determine a rumor's veracity.

In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth.

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues.

The CED extends edit-distance ideas to TVPDs by combining local substitution costs with penalized deletions/insertions, controlled by two parameters: \\(\u03b1\\) (trade-off between temporal misalignment and diagram discrepancy) and \\(\u03b2\\) (gap penalty). We also provide an explicit construction of CED-geodesics. Building on these ingredients, we present two practical barycenter solvers, one stochastic and one greedy, that monotonically decrease the CED Frechet energy. Empirically, the CED is robust to additive perturbations (both temporal and spatial), recovers temporal shifts, and supports temporal pattern search. On real-life datasets, the CED achieves clustering performance comparable or better than standard elastic dissimilarities, while our clustering based on CED-barycenters yields superior classification results. Overall, the CED equips TVPD analysis with a principled distance, interpretable geodesics, and practical barycenters, enabling alignment, comparison, averaging, and clustering directly in the space of TVPDs.

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bReFusion\uff0c\u5c06\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u5347\u5230slot\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6162\uff0c\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDMs\uff09\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReFusion\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u201c\u8ba1\u5212 - \u586b\u5145\u201d\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ecetoken\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\u5230slot\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cReFusion\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684MDMs\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad834%\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d8518\u500d\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0eARMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u4fdd\u63012.33\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "ReFusion\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting.

In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1).

Focusing on people counting in indoor environments using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, we systematically investigate a broad set of approaches, including amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting and threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u5ba4\u5185FMCW MIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u4eba\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8eSigmoid\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u3001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u96f7\u8fbe\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u4f20\u611f\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u9891\u57df\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\u3001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eSigmoid\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0cRMSE\u548cMAE\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e50.1%\u548c55.2%\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff0cMAE\u6700\u591a\u6539\u55848.8%\uff1b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5927\u7a7a\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\uff0c540\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6837\u672c\u65f6RMSE\u548cMAE\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e82.1%\u548c91.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level \"delta action\" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMotus\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMotus\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Mixture-of-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528UniDiffuser\u98ce\u683c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u76f8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u516d\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u3002", "result": "Motus\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bd4X - VLA\u63d0\u9ad815%\u3001\u6bd4Pi0.5\u63d0\u9ad845%\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad811 - 48%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u6240\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability. We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001.

However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8.

In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process.

We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner).

Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm.

Traditional manual processing is not feasible for either real-time applications or large arrays. Deep learning-based pickers trained on large earthquake catalogs offer an automated alternative. However, they are typically optimized for high signal-to-noise, long-duration networks and struggle with the challenges presented by microseismic datasets, which are purpose-built for limited time without previously detected seismicity. In this study, we demonstrate how a network-wide earthquake phase picker, the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), can be adapted to microseismic monitoring using transfer learning. Starting from a PhaseNO model pre-trained on more than 57,000 three-component earthquake and noise records, we fine-tune the model using only 200 labeled and noise seismograms from induced events in hydraulic-fracturing settings. The fine-tuned model thus preserves the rich spatio-temporal representation learned from abundant earthquake data, while adapting to the characteristics and labeling conventions of microseismic phases, which are often picked on peaks or troughs rather than onsets. We evaluate performance on three distinct real-world microseismic datasets with different network geometries and acquisition parameters. Compared to the original PhaseNO and a conventional workflow, the adapted model increases F1 score and accuracy by up to 30%, and strongly reduces systematic timing bias and pick uncertainty. Because the adaptation relies on a small, campaign-specific calibration set, the approach is readily transferable to other microseismic tasks where public earthquake data and pre-trained models are accessible.

Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum.

We first construct a 200k dataset with explicit tool-selection rationales across 1,000+ tools and 100+ tasks spanning mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. Building on this data foundation, AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) supervised and RL-based trajectory stabilization for coherent reasoning, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking to refine consistent multi-step tool selection. Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool.

By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $\u03b2_0$ errors by 60% and $\u03b2_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively.

When faced with these ambiguities, TTI models have been shown to exhibit biases in their interpretations. These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases.

By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis.

Our model design is guided by the abundant experimental literature on mental rotation, which we complemented with experiments in VR where participants could at times manipulate the objects to compare, providing us with additional insights into the cognitive process of mental rotation.

Core and cutting information is useful for making sound interpretations of well logs; however, these are rarely collected at each depth due to high costs. Moreover, well log interpretation using traditional methods is constrained by poor borehole conditions. Traditional statistical methods are mostly linear, often failing to discriminate between lithology and rock facies, particularly when dealing with overlapping well log signals characterized by the structural and compositional variation of rock types. In this study, we develop multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to jointly analyze multivariate well log data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expeditions 390 and 393 for enhanced lithological interpretations. Among the algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network models, the Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 0.9950 and an F1-score of 0.9951. While unsupervised machine learning (ML) provides the foundation for cluster information that inherently supports the classification algorithm, supervised ML is applied to devise a data-driven lithology clustering mechanism for IODP datasets. The joint ML-based method developed here has the potential to be further explored for analyzing other well log datasets from the world's oceans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790IODP\u6d4b\u4e95\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5ca9\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4ed6\u6d77\u6d0b\u6d4b\u4e95\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u4e95\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e95\u51b5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5ca9\u6027\u548c\u5ca9\u76f8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u5ca9\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790IODP\u6d4b\u4e95\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.9950\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.9951\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4e16\u754c\u5176\u4ed6\u6d77\u6d0b\u7684\u6d4b\u4e95\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

Here, we tackle a related but distinct problem: identifying the input configuration that returns pre-specified values of multiple independent computer experiments simultaneously. Motivated by computer experiments of the rotational torques acting upon a vehicle in flight, we aim to identify stable flight conditions which result in zero torque forces. We propose a \"joint contour location\" (jCL) scheme that strikes a strategic balance between exploring the multiple response surfaces while exploiting learning of the intersecting contours.

The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester (Machine Learning for Hydrodynamic Stability, arXiv:2407.09572), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5c94\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u62df\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u5c94\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672fKRnet\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u5747\u5300\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684Navier - Stokes\u6a21\u62df\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u5c94\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5339\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u6734\u7d20\u6570\u5b57\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u4e49\u65e5\u5386\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u7ecf\u5178\u5747\u5300\u5206\u7bb1\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f53\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u504f\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002"}}
